NOTES - All Stat Acronyms may be prefixed with "LA" to indicate League
        Average.  For example, LAHR would be interpreted to mean the
        league average for homers hit by batters in the year in question
        in an offensive formula (or homers given up in a pitching
        formula).  For calculations, the lower the league average in
        this case (in an offensive formula) the better an individual's
        homer output would be extrapolated.

        Stat Acronyms may be upper case, lower case, or mixed case.

        The formula is evaluated from left to right.  Use parentheses to
        enforce precedence.

        Many of the pitching stats are not available for most years, to
        wit:  SG, DB, TP, RBI, IBB, SB, CS, SF, SH, OPAB, OPBA, SOPP.

        Some of the offensive stats are not available for many years, to
        wit:  IBB, K, GIDP, CS, SF.
