6 innings in favor of Hooks Wiltse.

At Cincinnati, the Reds lose to the Pirates, 9-4, with Pat Flaherty beating
Jack Harper.

1906
Brooklyn plays a Sunday game against Boston, charging no admission. Fans are
asked to drop contributions in a box at the gate. Deputy police commissioner
Arthur O'Keefe, in referring to last year's ploy of selling programs as a
way around admission charges, states:  "If the Sunday games at Washington
Park are to be free games, in the literal sense of the word, Mr. Ebbets
may be right in assuming that they will not constitute a violation of the
law. If, on the other hand, an admission fee is exacted in any manner we
will consider the law violated, and act accordingly." Boston tops Brooklyn,
5-3, with no arrests reported.

Chicago's Ed Reulbach beats the Reds, 8-5, to start a streak of 16 straight
wins over Cincinnati. The streak will conclude August 18, 1909.

1907
Brooklyn's Nap Rucker makes his ML debut, and rookie mistakes give him a
3-2 loss to Boston. All 3 runs against him come in the 2nd inning when he
makes 2 wild throws and 2 wild pitches. Claude Ritchey scores the 3rd run,
stealing home as Rucker holds the ball.

The Cleveland club takes out a $100,000 policy to insure its players against
injury in railroad accidents.

1909
With Christy Mathewson sidelined with a bruised hand, the result of a line
drive off the bat of Moose McCormick, Red Ames gets the call. Before an
Opening Day crowd of 30,000 at the Polo Grounds, right-hander Ames pitches
a no-hitter for 9 innings against the Brooklyn Superbas, loses it with one
out in the 10th, then loses the game 3-0 in the 13th. Kaiser Wilhelm matches
Ames by not allowing a hit until the 8th inning. The Giants outfield has
no putouts.

In the Browns' 4-1 win over visiting Cleveland, Brownie Danny Hoffman bangs
the first homer ever hit at Sportsman's Park. In 1956, Willie Mays will
collect the last.

1911
Walter Johnson ties a ML record by striking out 4 batters in the 5th inning
of Washington's 6-2 loss against Boston. The 5th inning runner scores the
games 1st run, and Boston scores 3 more in the 6th, plus runs in the 7th
and 9th to beat the Senators' ace.

Grover Cleveland Alexander makes his ML debut, but an unearned run in the

Howie Camnitz.

1915
Rube Marquard, who lost 22 games for the Giants in 1914, pitches a 2-0
no-hitter over Brooklyn in the Giants' 2nd game of the season. The loser
is Nap Rucker, who pitched a no-hitter in 1908. Rube faces just 30 batters,
walking Stengel and Zack Wheat, while George Cutshaw reaches on an error.

With Red Faber on the mound, the White Sox roll over the Browns, 16-0,
giving Faber his 2nd win in 2 days. Faber strikes out 10. Led by Eddie
Collins, the Sox pull off a triple steal in the 1st inning.

With the game tied at 3-3 in the 9th, Tris Speaker draws a 2-out walk, goes
to 3rd on a hit-and-run by Lewis and then scores on a double steal. Boston
beats the A's, 5-3.

The Brookfeds score 10 runs in the 5th to beat Newark (FL), 17-6.

1916
In a 9-4 win, White Sox C Ray Schalk steals twice against Detroit enroute
to a season total of 30. This is a record for catchers until 1982 when John
Wathan nicks 36.

1918
The AL season opens with Boston's Babe Ruth pitching a 4-hit, 7-1 victory
over the A's, his 3rd opening day victory in a row. Willie Adams, pitching
his first ML game since 1913, takes the loss. Red Sox manager Ed Barrow
will start Ruth's conversion to slugger by working him into 72 games as OF-1B.

In the opener in Washington, pre-game ceremonies include a biplane scattering
thousands of liberty loan cards for the war effort. The Yankees, under new
manager Miller Huggins, rap 11 hits to beat Walter Johnson, 6-3. Starter
George Mogridge gets the win despite pitching just 3 1/3 innings. Allan
Russell relieves and allows just one hit in 5 1/3 innings to save the
victory. Johnson strikes out two while allowing 11 hits and will lose again
in the 3-game series with New York.

1920
In Boston, the Sox jump on Washington ace Walter Johnson and score 5 runs
on four hits before the Big Train is lifted after 2 innings. Johnson's sore
arm will limit him to an 8-10 record this year. The Sox hang on to win 7-6
with Allan Russell picking up the win.

The Yanks rally for 4 runs in the last 3 innings to top the A's, 4-1. Ruth
is hitless in 5 at-bats.

1921
At Crosley Field, Pirates right-hander Chief Yellow Horse makes his major
league debut against the Reds. The Pittsburgh hurler, a member of a North
American Plains Indian tribe called the Pawnees, is believed by many
baseball historians to be the first full-blooded American Indian to play
in the big leagues.

1922
The Giants pummel three Dodger pitchers for 11 runs in the first inning,
winning 17-10.

The Browns pound five White Sox pitchers for 21 hits to win, 14-0, behind

1924
The Giants open before the NL's biggest Opening Day crowd, more than 45,000
fans, but lose to Brooklyn, 3-2.

The Reds beat the Pirates, 6-5, before a crowd of 35,747, a record for
Redland Field. Tom Sheehan is the winner over Lee Meadows. Bubbles Hargrave
is 4 for 4 with a pair of triples. This is the first Reds game broadcast on
the radio, on WLW and WSAI. KDKA also broadcasts the game back to Pittsburgh.

After President Coolidge tosses out the first ball, Walter Johnson shuts
out the A's 4-0 on Opening Day, his 99th shutout. Slim Harriss, who topped
Walter in last year's Opening Day game, is the loser. One of the 4 hits off
Johnson is a single by rookie Al Simmons, who hit .360 at Shreveport (Texas)
and .398 in Milwaukee (AA) last season. Another A's rookie (of sorts), Paul
Strand, goes 0 for 4. Strand, the PCL's top hitter the past two seasons,
collected 325 hits in 1923, still an all-time record, and then was a
high-priced purchase by Connie Mack. Strand last appeared in the majors in
1915 as a pitcher with the Boston Braves, and he'll play just a third of
the season before he and his .228 average will go back west.

George Sisler returns after missing a full year due to impaired vision caused
by severe sinusitis. He is 2 for 4 in the Browns' 7-3 win over the White Sox.

The opener at Fenway Park draws 25,000 (23,856 paid) but the Red Sox lose
a heartbreaker to the Yankees, 2-1. The Sox lead, 1-0 after 8 innings with
Howard Ehmke driving in the lone run. But two 9th-inning errors by 2B Bill
Wambsganss allow two unearned runs and pin the loss on Ehmke. Bob Shawkey
pitches 8 innings and is replaced by Waite Hoyt, the winning pitcher.

The Cards beat the Cubs, 6-5 as Jeff Pfeffer is the winner over Vic
Aldridge. Despite the victory, St. Louis will waive the veteran to Pittsburgh
next month. The Cards' Rogers Hornsby is the only batter who ever goes 2
for 5 on Opening Day and improves on his BA for the rest of the year. His
.424 will be the highest ML BA in the 20th century. The Cardinals open
the season with the players wearing small numbers on their sleeves, an
experiment that will continue in 1925, then be dropped.

1926
In Philadelphia, Cy Williams blasts a grand slam to give the Phils an 8-4
win over the Boston Braves.

1927
Babe Ruth hits his first homer of the year, off Howard Ehmke in the 1st,
in New York's 6-3 victory over the visiting Athletics. Herb Pennock goes
the distance for the win.

Willie Sherdel allows just 2 Cub hits but one is a HR by Hack Wilson into
the CF bleachers at Wrigley. Sherdel and the Cards lose, 1-0, to Percy Jones

1928
At St. Louis, the Cards edge the Cubs, 4-3, as Frankie Frisch continues
his hot hitting with a homer, triple and a single. Bill Sherdel gives up
a 3-run homer to Gabby Hartnett in the 2nd, but answers by homering in the
5th to help win. Pat Malone loses his 2nd game.

In Baltimore, the Yankees beat the Orioles (IL), 5-2. Ruth plays 1B, while
Gehrig, in right field, bangs a homer. Dickey also homers off former Brownie
Bob Bolen.

1930
On Opening Day, Philadelphia's Les Sweetland three-hits the Dodgers at
Ebbets Field. The 28-year-old southpaw doubles and scores the lone run in
the Phillies 1-0 victory over Brooklyn. Sweetland will end the year with
a 7.71 ERA, one of the highest ever.

Weather curtails the AL Opening Day schedule, but at Shibe Park the matchup
between the A's and the Yankees features nine future Hall of Famers in
the lineups, and three more, Pennock, Hoyt and Gomez, on the New York
bench. Minutes before the game, Al Simmons ends his holdout, signs a contract,
and homers in his first at-bat as the A's and Lefty Grove defeat the Yankees'
George Pipgras, 6-2. Ruth's clout in the 3rd inning strikes a loudspeaker
in deep right center and bounds back onto the field. The tree of amplifiers
juts about 5 feet over the playing field and the umps rule it a ground rule
double. The Yankees argue that it should be a two-run homer, but to no avail,
though both Koenig and Ruth score when Grove is slow covering 1B and Foxx'
throw misses him.

In St. Louis, the Cubs open with a 9-8 win over the Cards. Rogers Hornsby,
whose heel was operated on over the winter, is noticeably limping in the
game. The newly acquired Showboat Fisher is 4 for 5.

1931
New York Giant Hal Schumacher is less than princely in his ML debut as the
Phils rock him for 7 hits and 7 runs in just 1 1/3 innings in a 10-7 loss to
Philadelphia. New York reliever Bill Morrell serves up a homer to 32-year-old
rookie Buzz Arlett, on his way to the best one-season performance ever. Buzz
will hit .313 with 18 homers and 72 RBIs before returning to the West Coast
and the PCL. In 1984, SABR members will name Arlett the best minor leaguer
of all-time.

In a 9-3 loss to Boston, Ernie Lombardi makes his ML debut, replacing Al
Lopez. Lombardi goes 2 for 2.

1932
The A's edge the Yankees, 9-8, on Jimmy Dykes' sac fly in the 9th inning. Foxx
and Cochrane add homers for the A's.

1933
In his major league debut, Tigers rookie Schoolboy Rowe tosses a six-hitter
blanking the White Sox, 3-0. During his 15-year career, playing also with
the Dodgers and Phillies, Lynwood will compile a 158-101 record posting an
ERA of 3.87.

1934
In the 3rd of a 3-game set, all played at Braves Field, the Red Sox take
the rubber game, 11-3. Carl Reynolds and Bill Werber homer, with the win
going to Johnny Welch.

1936
The Giants' Harry Gumbert defeats the Dodgers' Van Lingle Mungo, 5-3,
in a game that features a fine brawl between Mungo and Dick Bartell. On an
unassisted ground out to 1B Buddy Hassett, Mungo comes over to cover the bag
and gives a hard block to the batter Bartell. Rowdy Richard goes flying and
comes up swinging. Umpire Beans Reardon races over and pries the 2 combatants
apart, then tosses them. Tomorrow they get a fine from Frick. Ox Eckard, 35,
a veteran of the NFL Giants, clubs his one and only ML homer, a 2-run shot,
for the Dodgers.

1938
The Dodgers buy OF Ernie Koy from the Yankees.

1941
Cubs SS Lou "second" Stringer makes 4 errors in his debut, a NL record for
a player in his first game. Stringer does better on offense adding 2 hits
and 2 RBIs, and Chicago beats the Pittsburgh Pirates, 7-4, behind Claude
Passeau and a clutch HR by Bill Nicholson. The win is the first for Jimmie
Wilson, making his managerial debut.

The Cardinals top the defending champion Reds 7-3, benefiting from homers
by Ernie Koy, Enos Slaughter and John Mize.

Bob Feller walks 7 White Sox batters, hits 2, and allows 5 hits as Chicago
edges Cleveland, 4-3. One of Feller's walks forces in the winning run. A
crowd of 46,064 breaks the Municipal Stadium record for an opener.

1942
At Sportman's Park in St. Louis, Hiram 'Hi' Bithorn becomes the first Puerto
Rican to play major league baseball. The Cubs' right-hander from Santurce
makes a relief appearance in the 4-2 loss to the Cardinals.

At Washington, Bobo Newsom holds the Yankees in check for three innings,
but New York tallies three in the 4th and rolls on to a 9-3 victory. DiMaggio
has a single, double and long homer with two on into the CF bleachers. Phil
Rizzuto adds three singles to make the win easier for Spud Chandler.

The Giants score 6 runs in the 6th inning to top the Dodgers, 6-4. Ott's
Men start the scoring in the big inning with a leadoff homer by Danning
and conclude it with a grand slam by prized rookie Willard Marshall. The
two blows offset homers by Riggs and Walker for Brooklyn. Giants fans are
asked to return foul balls so that they can be sent to Army camps.

Behind the 7-hit pitching of Dizzy Trout, the Tigers topple the Indians,
6-2. Rudy York has a round tripper to help blast rookie Ray Poat from
the mound in the 4th. Poat, a college chum of Lou Boudreau's at Illinois,
is making his first start for the Tribe.

Jim Tobin pitches and bats the Braves to a 6-2 victory over the Phils. Tobin
scatters eight hits and clouts a fifth inning homer off Paul Masterson
with one on, but loses his shutout when Danny Litwhiler hits a 9th inning
homer. Braves rookie Nanny Fernandez is 4 for 5 and has now collected 7
hits in his first two games.

Following a tractor accident at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Johnny Sturm
has two joints on his right hand amputated, an operation that finishes his
baseball career. Sturm, who played first base for the Yanks, hit .239 with
4 homers as a rookie last year.

1947
A year before President Truman desegregated the military, Jackie Robinson
debuts for the Dodgers becoming the first black player to participate in a
major league game this century. In front of 25,623 Ebbets Field fans, the
28-year-old first baseman is hitless in three at-bats facing Johnny Sain,
but scores a run in the 5-3 Opening Day victory over the Braves. Robinson
handles 11 chances at 1B, a new position for him. Coach Clyde Sukeforth,
interim manager and the man credited with first scouting Robinson, guides
the team to 2 wins and a loss before he steps down. The Dodgers also announce
the release of Ed Head, who threw a no-hitter last year, to Ft. Worth.

In his NL debut, Hank Greenberg doubles home the only run in the 6th as
the Pirates Rip Sewell wins the opener in Chicago 1-0. Hank Borowy takes the
loss. Greenberg also handles 16 putouts and an assist at 1B. Pittsburgh bought
the slugging first baseman from the Tigers in the off-season for $75,000.

With yesterday's opener in Washington rained out, the A's open at Yankee
Stadium before 39,344. Under new manager Bucky Harris, the Yanks manage just
six hits off Phil Marchildon as the A's win, 6-1. Eddie Joost and Elmer
Valo pull off a double steal in the 5th when the A's increase their lead
to 3-0. Joost scores on the swipe of home. Former A's vet George McQuillan,
playing 1B for Nick Etten, scores New York's only run. Spud Chandler takes
the loss.

In St. Louis, the Browns open as usual against Hal Newhouser and the Tigers,
losing, 7-0. For Newhouser, it is his 13th straight win against St. Louis
(as noted by historian Lyle Spatz). The streak will be stopped at 15 games
on August 12.

1952
In the last home opener at Braves Field in Boston, 4,694 fans watch Warren
Spahn lose, 3-2, to Brooklyn's Preacher Roe. Campanella's bases-loaded
single in the 5th gives the Dodgers the go-ahead run.

Led by Hank Sauer's grand slam, the Cubs beat the host Reds, 6-5, in 10
innings. It is the only opening day slam in Cubs history.

At Shibe Park, Hank Bauer and Mickey Mantle lead a 14-hit attack against
Alex Kellner and Carl Scheib as the Yankees beat the A's, 8-1. Vic Raschi
allows two hits in 8 innings and wins his 2nd opener in a row. Bauer has
two hits and a homer, while Mantle has three hits, two RBIs and a stolen base.

1954
Following a 90-minute parade, in front of an Opening Day record crowd
of 46,354 fans, big league baseball returns to Baltimore after a 51-year
absence when the Orioles beat the White Sox in the first game played at
Memorial Stadium, 3-1. The Orioles' Clint Courtney hits the first HR in
Memorial Stadium. Bob Turley strikes out nine in besting Virgil Trucks. Vern
Stephens and Clint Courtney homer for the O's. A Baltimore ownership group,
which includes Clarence Mills, Jim Keelty, Jerry Hoffberger and Zanvyl
Krieger, bought the former St. Louis Browns and brought the franchise to
the Charm City.

Vic Raschi makes his NL debut but the host Braves knock the Cardinal vet out
of the game. Harvey Haddix, in relief, takes the loss, 7-6, with Warren Spahn
the winner for the Braves. Hank Aaron has his first hit as he goes 2 for 5.

1955
The clouting Cubs beat the Reds, 6-4, when Jackson and Banks hit back-to-back
homers in the 10th. Hal Jeffcoat, who hit a HR in the 9th, is the winner.

1957

innings. President Eisenhower tossed out the first ball at Griffin Stadium.
The ball was the 10 millionth Spalding baseball used in major league play.

1958
On Opening Day, the transplanted New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers play
the first major league game on the West Coast. The Californian contest sees
Ruben Gomez blanking Los Angeles and Don Drysdale at San Francisco's Seals
Stadium, 8-0. Giants SS Daryl Spencer hits the first HR on the Pacific Coast,
off Don Drysdale. The Giants set an attendance record for Seals Stadium by
drawing 23,192 fans.

OF Bill Tuttle of the Athletics records 2 assists in the 2nd inning, tying
a ML record. The A's win 5-0 and beat Herb Score in his first appearance
following his injury. Score lasts 3 innings.

In the opener at Fenway Park, 35,223 - the largest Red Sox crowd ever for
an opener - watch Don Larsen and the Yankees win, 3-0. Governor Foster
Furcolo tosses out the first ball. Yogi Berra's two run homer in the 7th
is the first score for New York off Russ Nixon, and Berra's 4th successive
opening day homer. This one is a 302-foot drive down the RF foul line.

1959
William Shea confers with Phillies owner William Carpenter on the possibility
of shifting the Phils franchise to New York City.

P Bob Grim of the Athletics hits a grand slam off Barry Latman, as the A's
nip the White Sox 10-8.

Red Sox rookie Jerry Casale makes his ML debut beating the Senators,
7-3. Casale helps his cause with a 3-run homer off Russ Kemmerer, a shot
that clears Fenway's right-center field wall and lands on the street.

Don Drysdale scatters 8 hits in shutting out the Cardinals, 5-0. The
loser is Jackson, who goes 6 innings before giving way to 23-year-old Bob
Gibson, making his ML debut. It's a rude initiation as the first batter the
right-hander faces, Jim Baxes, homers off him. Gibson tosses two innings. For
the 31-year-old Baxes, it is his first ML homer:  he'll hit 17 in just 246
at-bats, 16 more than his brother Mike, in this, his only season. Gibson
becomes the first future Hall of Fame hurler to give up a homerun to the
first batter he faces in the major leagues.

1961
The Dodgers and Pirates tie a ML record by turning 9 DPs (Los Angeles 5,
Pittsburgh 4) in a 9-inning 4-1 Buc home win. It is only the 2nd time
(July 3, 1929) that 9 DPs have been turned in a NL game.

1964
Work begins on an $18 million stadium in Atlanta.

1966
Bob Gibson's 9-2 win at Forbes Field is the 18th straight for St. Louis
in Pittsburgh. St. Louis ties the ML record set by the Dodgers against the
Phillies in 1945-46 for consecutive road wins against one club.

Cleveland scores 6 runs in the 6th and pushes one across in the 12th to
beat the Boston Red Sox, 8-7. Jack Kralick is the winning pitcher. George

the 1st inning on his way to a 7-3 win over visiting Houston.

1968
Three records are smashed when the Astros score an unearned run in the 24th
inning to squeeze by the Mets 1-0 after 6 hours and 6 minutes. The game ends
when Bob Aspromonte's grounder goes through the legs of shortstop Al Weis
scoring Norm Miller from third base with one out. Each team had 79 at-bats
and 11 hits in the game. It is the longest NL game played to completion,
the longest ML night game, and the first 23 innings are the longest ML
scoreless game. Oddly, the records erased for longest night and scoreless
games are less than a year old (June 12 and September 1, 1967). The game
ties the AL's longest complete game:  A's 4, Red Sox 1 on September 1, 1906.

1969
At Cincinnati, the Reds and Giants battle for 12 innings before the Reds
win, 11-10. The game is 5-5 at the end of 8 innings, and each team score 3
in the 9th and 2 runs in the 10th. Johnny Bench's bases-loaded single off
Gaylord Perry ends it in the 12th.

1972

innings. Jackson is reported as the first ML player with facial hair since
C Wally Schang of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1914.

Cardinals, for Scipio Spinks and Lance Clemons.

game-winner. The Orioles split for the day by taking the nitecap.

In the first of 2 in San Francisco, Cesar Geronimo has 4 singles and a
double to lead the Reds to an 11-0 pasting of the Giants. The Reds pin the
loss on Juan Marichal. Cincy completes the sweep in game 2, winning 7-3.

1976
In the debut of the 'new' Yankee Stadium, 52,613 fans watch the Bronx Bombers
shell Minnesota on Opening Day, 11-4. Bob Shawkey, winner of the 1923 Stadium
opener, throws out the ceremonial first pitch in the ballpark that has been
completely rebuilt from top to bottom, with the fences, the seats, the roof
and the original grandstand being replaced. The Yankees have 14 hits today,
but the only HR is hit by Minnesota's Dan Ford.

1977
The Expos play their first game in Montreal's Olympic Stadium before a

off Jim Kaat. Wrothan is the winner with 4 2/3 innings of work. The 2 teams
strand 25 base runners.

1982
The Phils double the Mets, 8-4, in 13 innings. Aguayo's 2-out 3-run HR,
off Charlie Puleo, in the 13th makes it easy for Warren Brusstar.

1983
Detroit P Milt Wilcox is one out away from a perfect game when pinch hitter
Jerry Hairston singles, and Wilcox settles for a 4-0 one-hitter over White
Sox ace LaMar Hoyt. This is only the 5th time in ML history a perfect bid has
been stopped with one out to go:  the last was Milt Pappas on September 2,
1972. Pappas finished with a no hitter.

The Astros avoid the worst start in modern ML history by beating the Expos
7-6 in 10 innings for their first win of the season in 10 games.

1987
Twenty-two-year-old Juan Nieves throws the first no-hitter in Brewers
history, 7-0 at Baltimore, and Milwaukee runs its record to 9-0.

the 2nd game in a row, Brian Downing hits a leadoff homer for all the runs
Kirk needs.

1988
During the Reds 4-2 10-inning victory over the Astros, Reds SS Dave Concepcion
is ejected from the dugout for blowing kisses at umpire Dave Pallone. The
two have had a running feud.

Cleveland edges Baltimore, 3-2, with the win going to Yett, who has yet to

1991
Phillies pitcher Jason Grimsley uncorks 4 wild pitches in a 5-4 loss to
the Cubs.

4 at-bats.

Mariners hurler Randy Johnson commits a balk in the 4th inning of a game
against Minnesota when the Seattle mascot, Mariner Moose, throws a bag of
peanuts onto the Kingdome turf. Johnson shakes it off and goes the distance
in the 8-4 victory for his 1st win of the season.

1993
Boston's Andre Dawson slams the 400th HR of his career (the 25th player to
do so) in the Red Sox' 4-3 win over the Indians. Boston scores a pair of
runs in the 13th off Eric Plunk for the W.

The Tigers best Oakland, 3-2, giving manager Sparky Anderson his 2,000th
career win. Only 6 men in the history of the game have won more.

1994
With only 115 fans in attendance on a cold and rainy night at Pohlman Field,
Kelly Wunsch becomes the third player and first starting pitcher to strikeout
five batters in one inning in professional baseball. The Beloit Brewer
hurler, who was drafted by Milwaukee in the first round (26th pick overall)
of the 1993 amateur draft, makes this possible when two of those victims

from the catcher. Wunsch loses, but his mitt ends up in Cooperstown. The
Beloit Brewers lose, 7-3, to Springfield (IL) of the Midwest League.

The Angels rally to score 7 runs in the bottom of the 9th inning against
Toronto to tie the game at 13-13. The Blue Jays had scored 5 runs in the
top half of the inning to take a 10-3 lead. California pushes across the
winning run in the 10th to come out on top with a 14-13 victory.

1997
Seattle 1B Paul Sorrento gets 5 hits, including a pair of doubles, and
drives home 4 runs in the Mariners' 8-4 win over Cleveland to move 1 game
ahead of the Athletics in the AL West.

With a crowd of 54,047 on hand at Shea, the Mets shut out the Dodgers,
5-0. President Clinton (on crutches after breaking his leg) is present and
delivers a speech after the 4th inning. Bud Selig announces that #42 would
be retired in perpetuity by all Major League teams, but those currently
wearing it could continue to do so for the rest of their careers. New York
Yankees' Mariano Rivera will retire after the 2013 season, thus officially
retiring number 42, as he was the last player to wear the number 42 jersey
on a regular basis.

1998
The Yankees defeat the Angels, 6-3, in an afternoon game played at Shea
Stadium. The Mets defeat the Cubs, 2-1, in a night game, marking the first
time in history that American and National League games are played in the
same park on the same day. The afternoon game drew a crowd of 40,743 while
the night game drew 16,012. Sammy Sosa of the Cubs hits his 210th career
HR. He breaks Bob Horner's major league record for most HRs without a grand
slam from the start of a career.

San Diego's Kevin Brown shuts out the Giants, 1-0, on a 4-hitter. Brown
almost matches the Giants himself, as he gets 3 hits in 4 at-bats.

In a 5-3 loss to the visiting Mariners, the Indians' David Bell hits the
1st inside-the-park HR in Jacobs Field history and the 1st for the Indians
since July 18, 1989 (Joe Carter). Randy Johnson and Kenny Lofton are both
ejected after the 2 argue about inside pitches.

1999
The Blue Jays sign free agent 2B Pat Kelly.

Colorado manager Jim Leyland wins his 1,000th game as the Rockies beat San
Diego, 6-4.

2000
In the 2,800th game of his career, Orioles infielder Cal Ripken lines a
base hit to center off the Twins' Hector Carrasco to become the 24th major
leaguer to reach the 3000th hit milestone. The single also makes the 'Iron
Man' only the seventh player to get 3,000 hits and 400 homeruns in major
league history. The Orioles defeat the Twins, 6-4. Ripken goes 3 for 5.

Pedro Martinez (7 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 9 SO) paces the Red Sox to a 14-2 win
over the A's Tim Hudson. Carl Everett had 3 hits including 2 doubles, and
4 RBI. Three sons of former major-league umpires work the game:  Jerry (son
of Shag) Crawford, Mike (son of Lou) DiMuro and Brian (son of Tom) Gorman.

2001
When Todd Hollandsworth steps into the batter's box to start the bottom
of the fourth frame, a swarm of bees is discovered on the right field
auxiliary scoreboard at Coors Field. After a nine minute delay the game
starts without incident to the players, fans or bees, but the Rockies'
outfielder gets the crowd buzzing by hitting three homeruns and drives home
7 runs following the incident, including a three-run walk off round-tripper
in the tenth inning of Colorado's 10-7 victory over Arizona. Hollandsworth
is the ninth major-leaguer to hit three homers in a game with the last being
a game-ender. Jack Clark, with the Red Sox in 1991, was the last to do it.

The Braves' Odalis Perez (7 IP) allows just 4 singles in sinking the
Phillies, 3-0. Perez is making his 1st start after missing the entire 2000
season because of Tommy John surgery. Brian Jordan and Andruw Jones homer
for the Braves.

Eric Milton strikes out 10, including the first 4 hitters on called 3rd
strikes, in 7 innings. The surprising Twins edge the visiting White Sox,
4-3, to complete a 3-game sweep. Corey Koskie is 4 for 4 for the Twins.

The Cubs complete a sweep of the Pirates as Kerry Wood strikes out 10 in
a 5-1 win.

2003
The Royals rally for 4 runs in the 9th inning to pull out an 8-5 win over
the White Sox. Play is temporarily halted in the 8th inning as a fan runs
onto the field and attacks umpire Laz Diaz. The last time the two teams
met in Chicago on September 19 two fans attacked KC 1B coach Tom Gamboa.

2004
Fifty-seven years after the historic event, major league baseball begins
the tradition of Jackie Robinson Day, an annual celebration marking the
day the color line was broken in baseball. At big league parks across the
country there are ceremonies honoring the ground-breaking Dodger rookie
second baseman, including baseball commissioner Bud Selig joining his widow,
Rachel Robinson, for a Shea Stadium tribute.

The Marlins defeat the Expos, 3-0, to become the first team since the 1995
Orioles to sweep a 3-game series with shutouts. Carl Pavano and 2 relievers
do the whitewashing today to follow up wins by Penny and Willis. It is the
4th consecutive time the Marlins have shut out Montreal. The Expos have
scored just 10 runs in their first 9 games, which is the 2nd lowest figure
ever, ahead of just the 1907 Brooklyn Superbas.

2005
Right-hander Ben Sheets, who agreed to a one-year deal worth $6 million
during the off season to avoid salary arbitration, signs a $38.5 million
four-year contract to stay with Milwaukee. The deal is the richest in the
history of the Brewers.

To commemorate the 58th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's first game in the
big leagues, the Dodgers wear replicas of the old road uniforms worn by
the 1947 team which played in Brooklyn. Derek Lowe throws a three-hitter
blanking the Padres in San Diego, 4-0.

In the first major league game played in Washington D.C. since September
30, 1971, the Nationals beat Arizona at RFK Stadium, 5-3. President George
W. Bush throws out the ceremonial first pitch after receiving the ball from
Joe Grzenda, the former Washington reliever who threw the final pitch in
Senators history.

A Fenway fan is ejected from the game after taking what appeared to be a
swipe at Gary Sheffield as the Yankee outfielder fields a ball hit by Jason
Varitek. The right-fielder's response, which includes shoving the fan, making
a fist and exchanging words, will be investigated by major league baseball.

The Mets down the Marlins, 4-0, behind Aaron Heilman's 1-hit shutout. Luis
Castillo's 4th inning infield single is the only safety recorded by Florida
as Heilman hurls the 1st complete game of his career.

San Francisco scores 9 runs off Jamey Wright in 4 innings and scales the
Rockies, 13-6. Noah Lowry is just slightly better allowing 9 hits and 6
runs in 5+ innings for the win. Pedro Feliz helps with a grand slam and 5
RBI, while the Rocks get offense from Clint Barmes, with 4 hits including 2
homers, and Mike Restovich with 3 hits. It won't assure Restovich of a job,
however ... he was acquired from the Twins on April 6, who had gotten him from
Tampa Bay on March 31. Colorado will send him to Pittsburgh on May 11, and
the Bucs will pass on him in November. In January 2006 the Cubs will sign him.

The Astros pound the Reds, 11-2, collecting 9 extra base hits including a
pair of homers by Jason Lane. It is the 12th straight win for Houston over
Cincinnati. The scoring might have been greater except for an unassisted DP by
Reds' catcher Jason LaRue who snags a popped bunt and tags the runner from 3B.

2006
The Athletics edge the Rangers, 5-4. Oakland gets back-to-back-to-back HRs
from Eric Chavez, Frank Thomas and Milton Bradley in the 6th inning off 3
consecutive pitches.

The Cardinals triple the Reds, 9-3, taking a 6-0 lead after three
innings. Albert Pujols homers, and Hector Luna homers and drives in three
runs. Scott Spiezio adds a seventh inning pinch homerun, to join his father,
Ed, as the first father-son duo to have each homered for the Redbirds. The
senior Spiezio played for the club from 1964 to 1968 hitting five long
balls. It was the 28th time that a father and son have hit at least one
homer for the same major-league team.

2007
To honor Jackie Robinson some players on each team, including Yankee shortstop
Derek Jeter and Braves' outfielder Andruw Jones, wear the Dodger immortal's
uniform No. 42 on the 60th anniversary of his historic breaking the color
barrier in baseball. In the Cardinals and Brewers contest at Busch Stadium
every player and coach on both teams dons Jackie's revered number.

2009
Texas infielder Ian Kinsler, having already collected a single, double
and homerun, admits he was trying for a triple when he batted in the sixth
inning of the 19-6 rout of Baltimore. The Rangers second baseman gets his
three-bagger enroute to a 6 for 6 cycle performance.

2010
Jorge Cantu establishes a major league record when he gets at least one
hit and bats in one or more runs for the first ten games at the start of
the season. The Marlins infielder's streak also proved to be the longest
during any point of this season.
