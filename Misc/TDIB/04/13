1911
With Cleveland leading St. Louis 3-1 in the 9th inning at Cleveland's League
Park, the game is stopped because of a severe storm. Many fans are bruised
by hailstones.

Phillies P Jack Rowan allows just 3 hits while his teammates pepper Christy
Mathewson for 14 hits in 18 innings. The Quakers beat the Giants, 6-1. Hours
later, the Polo Grounds grandstand and LF bleachers ignite in a mysterious
fire, lighting up the night sky with flames. President Frank Farrell of
the Highlanders invites the Giants to use the AL grounds, Hilltop Park;
the offer is accepted, paving the way for the Giants' invitation for the
AL team to use the Polo Grounds when the Hilltop Park lease expires after
the 1912 season. A $500,000 steel-and-concrete structure will replace the
wooden stands of the Polo Grounds.

1912
The Tigers down Cleveland, 12-4, icing it with seven runs in the 6th
inning. They get helped by a record tying three errors in the inning by "Big"
Bill James, making his ML debut on the mound. The Detroit News describes
Big Bill as "nearly seven feet (and) as awkward as they make them." He was
6'4." (as noted by Mike Grahek)

1914
Major league baseball returns to Baltimore as the first Federal League game
is played with approximately 27,000 patrons on hand to watch the Terrapins
beat the Buffalo Blues, 3-2.

After building 8 new ballparks in 3 months, the Federal League opens with
the Baltimore Terrapins beating Buffalo, 3-2, before 27,140. Winning P Jack
Quinn will win 26 and lose 14. Indianapolis will win the pennant led by
rookie Benny Kauff's league-leading .370 batting average. Ex-Pirate Claude
Hendrix will be 29-11.

1916
Babe Adams, the Pirates bellwether, pitches a one-hit 4-0 shutout against
the Cardinals, the only safety coming when a ball squirts out of 2B Joe
Schultz' mitt. He will win only one more game this season, and the Pirates
will release him in August. They will then re-sign him during the 1918 season.

Ernie Shore and Herb Pennock combine to give the Red Sox an 8-2 win over
the A's.

In a 4-2 loss to the Browns, Cleveland catcher Steve O'Neill completes a
double play (with SS Ray Chapman), the first of 36, a ML season record for
catchers that still stands.

1920
The Negro National League (chartered as the National Association of Colored
Professional Baseball Clubs) is organized at a meeting at the YMCA in Kansas
City, Missouri.

1921
After President Warren Harding throws the ceremonial first pitch at Griffith
Stadium, Washington loses to the Red Sox and Sam Jones, 6-3. It is first
time in six Opening Day contests the Senators have lost with the President
of the United States throwing out the first pitch. Also in attendance are
former president Woodrow Wilson and VP Calvin Coolidge. Walter Johnson leaves
after 4 innings and nine hits, the second time in a row he has failed to
finish an Opening Game.

In the season opener for the Yankees, warm weather and Babe Ruth contribute
to 37,000 fans crowding the Polo Grounds. After New York mayor John Hylan
tosses out the first ball, the Yankees tear into the A's, beating them 11-1
as every New Yorker scores at least one run. The Yanks lead is only 2-1
into the bottom of the 7th, but then they unload against Scott Perry. Bob
Hasty gives up the last 6 New York runs. Ruth is 5 for 5, with two doubles,
and Carl Mays has as many hits - 3 - as he allows. He's now won 11 straight
over the A's.

At Chicago, the Cubs open the season with a 5-4 win over the Cardinals'
Jesse Haines. Grover Cleveland Alexander goes all the way to pick up the
win for Chicago.

At Cincinnati, the Reds open with a 5-3 win over the Pirates. Babe Adams
loses to Dolf Luque.

1922
Dazzy Vance, 31, makes his Brooklyn debut and loses to the Giants' Phil
Douglas 4-3. In 1915 when Vance made one start for the Pirates, it was
Douglas who beat him. Since then Vance has been in the minors. Despite his
late start, the 6 foot 2 inch righthander will win 197 games in 14 years
and a place in the Hall of Fame in 1955.

1925
Stuffy McInnis is released by the Braves. He'll sign with the Pirates,
bat .368 in 59 games, and get into his 5th WS.

1926
More than 45,000 at the Polo Grounds watch Brooklyn's Jess Petty post an
Opening Day 3-0 one-hitter over the Giants. Frankie Frisch's double is the
lone hit. The NL introduces something new in this game, the rosin bag. The
Giants will win 7 in a row after the opener, only to be beaten again by
Petty, 2-1, on April 24th.

At Washington's Griffith Stadium, in the last of his 14 Opening Day starts,
38-year-old Walter Johnson takes on A's knuckleballer Eddie Rommel in
baseball's greatest Opening-Day pitchers' duel, a 15-inning battle won by
the Senators 1-0. Johnson gives up 6 hits, fans 12, and allows no runner
past 1B in a game he considers his greatest. Rommel allows 9 hits will
fanning 5. Bucky Harris singles and scores the lone run, coming home after
a Goslin double and a Joe Harris single.

At frigid Fenway Park, the hitting is hot as the Yankees and Red Sox combine
for 29 hits in the Opener. The Yankees score 4 runs in the 1st inning off
Howard Ehmke, the first of six Boston hurlers. Rudy Sommers, making his
first ML appearance in 12 years, takes over for Ehmke in the 5th. He gives
up 3 runs on doubles by Gehrig and Ruth, and New York stretches its lead to
11-1. A 5-run Boston outburst in the 6th sends New York starter Bob Shawkey
to the showers, but New York hangs on to beat the Red Sox, 12-11. Ruth and
Joe Dugan have three hits apiece for New York, while Ira Flagstead has 4
hits for Boston. Ehmke is the loser for Boston.

In ceremonies before the Opener in St. Louis, Rogers Hornsby receives a
trophy from the Cleveland Press, which asked its readers to choose their
most popular AL and NL player. Babe Ruth won in the AL. Hornsby then collects
3 hits as the Cards win the Opener with Pittsburgh, 7-6.

At Cincinnati, the Cubs lose to the Reds, 7-6, after scoring 5 in the 8th
to tie. Jakie May takes the win in the 10th when a Sammy Bohne single scores
the winner. Val Picinich homers in his 1st game as a Red.

1928
At Philadelphia, the Yankees edge the Athletics, 8-7, on a double by Babe
Ruth. Lou Gehrig hits a long drive off Eddie Rommel that goes through an
open window on 20th Street. Cy Moore allows just 2 hits through 5 innings
for New York before weakening, but picks up the win. Joe Hauser, returning
to the A's after a year in the minors, collects two homers and a triple.

1932
At the opener in Chicago, the White Sox top the Browns, 9-2 behind Sad Sam
Jones and 3 doubles by Casey Selph. In the 1st inning, the Browns' Goose
Goslin comes to bat with his war club having 12 white and black stripes
painted horizontally on it. Umpire Harry Geisel finds the bat distracting -
which was the point - and outlaws it. But Goose still collects 2 doubles
and a single.

In frigid weather at Detroit, the Indians trip the Tigers, 6-5, in 11
innings. On WHK, Jack Graney, former OF, is the Indians color announcer,
a job he will have till 1954.

1933
Delayed a day because of a spring storm, the Yankees open against the Red
Sox in front of 36,221 at Yankee Stadium. Lou Gehrig jump starts the offense
with a three-run homer in the first off former Yank Ivy Andrews, and the New
Yorkers score one more in the 4th to win, 4-3. Lefty Gomez is the winner,
but as with last year's opener, he needs help getting the last out.

Browns OF Sammy West goes 6 for 6 in an 11-inning 4-2 victory over the
White Sox. He has 5 singles and a double, all off Ted Lyons.

1939
With apparent muscle loss, especially around his shoulders, Yankee first
baseman Lou Gehrig goes deep twice in an exhibition game against the
Dodgers. The homeruns will be the last round trippers the 'Iron Horse'
will ever hit.

1941
In the final pre-season tune-up game with Brooklyn, the Yankees win their
3rd in a row at Ebbets Field, 3-0, on Sunday afternoon. The Dodgers had
come into the series with an 11-game winning streak, including 4 with the
Yanks on the way North.

At Fenway, the Bees take the 2nd game in a 2-game set against the Red Sox,
winning 10-3. Babe Dahlgren and Max West homer.

1946
Eddie Klepp, a white pitcher signed by the defending Negro League champion
Cleveland Buckeyes, is barred from the field in Birmingham, Alabama.

The Browns edge the Cardinals 3-2 before 16,855 in the opener of their city
series. Joe Grace's homer in the 8th is the difference. The Cardinals will
win tomorrow 4-3.

1953
On Opening Day, thanks to the three-hit pitching of Max Surkont, the former
Boston Braves win their first game representing the city of Milwaukee
by beating the Reds, 2-0, at Crosley Field. It is the first time since
Baltimore shifted to New York to become the Highlanders (Yankees) fifty
years ago that a franchise has moved to a different city.

In Cincinnati, over 30,000 see the Milwaukee Braves win their first game,
2-0, behind Max Surkont's 3-hitter. Rookie Billy Bruton singles, steals 2B,
and scores the 1st run.

Rain cancels the presidential opener in Washington with the Senators facing
the Yankees.

1954
Hitting against the Cubs' Paul Minner, Cardinal rookie Wally Moon homers in
his first ML AB. But Minner homers to back his own pitching, as the Cubs win
13-4. Moon, the 24-year-old Cardinal center fielder, who will be selected
as the National League's Rookie of the Year, will also homer in the last
at-bat of his freshman season. Seven years after the team had threatened
to strike because of the integration of baseball by Jackie Robinson, Tom
Alston becomes the first black player to appear in a Cardinal uniform. The
highly-touted first baseman, a North Carolina A&T graduate, will hit .244
during his brief major league career.

Making his major league debut during the first season opener at Forbes Field
in 61 years, before 32,294, second baseman Curt Roberts becomes the first
black to play for the Pirates. The former Kansas City Monarch, signed by
72-year-old general manager, Branch Rickey, triples off Robin Roberts in
the first inning as the Bucs beat the Phillies, 4-2.

Second baseman 'Spook' Forrest Jacobs, in his first ML game, becomes the
first major league rookie to collect 4 hits in an Opening Day debut (the
feat will not be accomplished again until Delino DeShields of the Expos
goes 4 for 6 on Opening Day in 1990) while Bill Renna and Gus Zernial bang
homers in the A's 6-4 victory over the Red Sox. Bobby Shantz is the winner,
but leaves in the 6th because of a pulled muscle which will take several
years to completely heal. He won't pitch again this year ending the season
today at 1-0. Mel Parnell goes 6 innings for the loss.

Henry Aaron of the Braves makes his ML debut, going hitless in 5 trips to the
plate in a 9-8 loss to the Redlegs. Cincy LF Jim Greengrass bangs 4 doubles
to tie an opening day record set by Tigers first baseman Pop Dillon. Andy
Pafko takes a hit when he's beaned by Joe Nuxhall. Because of the extra
seats set up to accommodate the overflow crowd, 12 of the 13 doubles hit
in the game are of the ground rule variety. With the rule change, players
take their mitts with them at the end of each inning, rather than leaving
them on the playing field.

In the presidential opener in Washington, President Dwight D. Eisenhower
is thrilled by Mickey Vernon's 10th inning 2-run game-ending homer off
Allie Reynolds which beats the Yankees 5-3. Ike skipped last year's opener,
which was rained out, and the political hue and cry was so great he made
sure he tossed out the first ball today. Chuck Stobbs and Whitey Ford start
the game, but the winning Nats pitcher is reliever Sonny Dixon. Hank Bauer,
with two singles, drives in all three Yankee runs.

The Giants, fresh from a Cactus League season where they beat the Indians
13 out of 21 meetings, trip the Dodgers, 4-3. Back in CF after 2 years in
the army, Willie Mays of the Giants hits a 2-run shot that beats Brooklyn.

The brand new Baltimore Orioles open in Detroit and lose, 3-0. Don Larsen
takes the loss against Steve Gromek. The Tigers start fast and will win 12
of their first 18 games.

In Boston, Braves Field is renamed BU Field by its new owners, Boston
University.

1955
The Dodgers open what will be their only World Championship season in
Brooklyn by beating Pittsburgh, 6-1. Carl Erskine is the winner.

At Philadelphia, Robin Roberts holds the Giants hitless until, with one out
in the 9th, Alvin Dark singles after Rhodes reaches 1B on an error. After
Mays strikes out, Irvin doubles in 2 runs. Ashburn and Ennis, injured in an
exhibition game collision, sit out the opener. Ashburn's consecutive-games
played streak is stopped at 731.

In the Opener at Yankee Stadium, the Yanks rout the Senators 19-1. Winner
Whitey Ford gets 3 hits and only allows 2, as he knocks in 4 runs. Mickey
Mantle and Bob Cerv also drive home 4 runs. Mantle, Yogi Berra and Bill
Skowron crack homers, while Cerv and Andy Carey add triples. Mickey McDermott,
in 3+ innings of work, is the loser, as the Yanks register the biggest margin
of victory in an opener. The most runs in an opener was by the Indians,
21-14 over the Browns in 1925.

1958
Buffalo refuses to play in Havana despite an IL vote and assurances.

1961
Alvin Dark pulls all the right strings to give the Giants a 6-5 win over
the Pirates. Joey Amalfitano, hitting for cleanup man McCovey in the 8th,
singles in Mays for a 4-4 tie; new catcher Hobie Landrith homers in the
11th to tie at 5 apiece, and Kuenn's single in the 12th wins it.

1962
On a wintery day, the Mets play their first home game ever at the Polo Grounds
(which sparkles after a $350,000 face-lift) as only 12,447 fans show up to
see the return of National League baseball to the 'Big Apple'. On Friday
the 13th, with the score tied, the Pirates score the decisive run on two
wild pitches thrown by Ray Diavault and beat New York, 4-3.

In the home opener at Tiger Stadium, Detroit's starting pitcher Frank Lary
pulls a muscle legging out a triple in the 7th against New York and is
forced to leave the game. Compensating for the injury causes subsequent
arm problems which shortens "The Yankee Killer's" career. Lary will win
just 2 games this season after notching 23 wins in 1961.

Stan Musial scores his 1,869th run - a new NL record. The Cardinals beat
the Cubs 8-5 in 15 innings.

1963
After 11 hitless at-bats, Cincinnati 2B Pete Rose records his first ML hit,
a triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. Increased enforcement of the balk rule
produces a ML record 7 in the Pirates' 12-4 trouncing at Cincinnati. Friend
is called for 4 balks.

Red Sox rookie Dave Morehead shuts out the Senators, 3-0, in his first ML
start. He's the first Red Sox pitcher to debut with a shutout since Boo
Ferriss in 1945.

1964
After beating the Reds, 6-3, in the traditional Opening Day game in
Cincinnati, Houston is in first place for the first and only time as the
Colt 45's.

1965
At Crosley Field, Reds rookie Tony Perez connects for his first homer,
a grand slam off Braves hurler Denny LeMaster, to help the Reds win, 8-3.

1966
The Robinsons - Frank and Brooks - hit back-to-back homers in the first
inning to lead the Orioles to an 8-1 win over the Red Sox at Fenway.

1969
After two years of arm trouble, the O's Jim Palmer shuts out the Senators,
2-0, on a four-hitter. It is Palmer's first appearance for the Orioles
since September 19, 1967.

Mike Fiore hits the first HR in the history of the KC Royals as they beat
the Athletics, 4-1, in game 1 of a twinbill. But the A's take the nitecap,
3-0. Butler has assistance from Moe Drabowsky in the opener, and Jim Nash
fires the shutout in the nitecap.

1970
In their home opener at the Oakland Coliseum, a 2-1 victory over Milwaukee,
the A's use gold-colored bases. This colorful innovation will quickly be
banned by the MLB's Rules Committee. Reggie Jackson's 2-run single and the
3-hit pitching of Hunter and Segui is enough to beat Marty Pattin.

1971
A 2-run single by Lou Piniella in the 7th allows the Royals to beat the Twins,
5-3, in a game that features a record 7 HBP. This ties the mark set by the
Tigers and Senators on August 24, 1914. The plunkers include Tom Burgmeir
(2), York (1) and Abernathy (1) for KC, and Williams (1) and Perranoski
(2) for the Twins.

1972
The end of the baseball strike is announced with an abbreviated schedule
to start 2 days later.

1975
The Astros retire Don Wilson's number 40 posthumously in tribute to the
right-hander who was found dead of asphyxiation by carbon monoxide in
the garage of his family's home in January. The 29-year-old fireballer,
the author of an 18 strikeout game that tied a major league record, spent
nine seasons with Houston compiling a record 104-92 along with an ERA of 3.15.

In San Diego, the Reds roll over the Padres, 10-0, behind Don Gullett's
2-hitter.

1976
Milwaukee's Jim Slaton throws his 2nd straight complete game shut out,
beating Detroit 1-0. The Brewers' only run was an unearned score in the
top of the 9th.

1978
On Opening Day, Roger Maris returns to Yankee Stadium for the first time since
being traded to the Cardinals in 1966. The prodigal son, who has shunned
many previous invitations, returns to help Mickey Mantle hoist the club's
World Champion flag due to the promise of team owner George Steinbrenner to
install sod and lights for the baseball field at his children's school in
Gainesville, Florida. New York wins, 4-2, over Chicago, Reggie Jackson hits a
three-run homer in the first inning, his fourth consecutive round-tripper at
Yankee Stadium including going deep three times in last year's Fall Classic
finale. The game is delayed as the crowd celebrates by showering the field
with Reggie! Bars, a chocolate and peanut candy bar with a picture of the
slugger swinging a bat, that was given to every fan entering the game.

Joe Rudi beats the buzzer and hits a game-ending homerun in the 11th off
Tom Johnson to give the Angels a 1-0 win over the Twins. A curfew law states
that no inning can start after 3:50 pm:  Rudi hits his homer at 3:55. Nolan
Ryan throws 10 shutout innings and strikes out 12 for no decision.

The Tigers take two from Texas, winning 6-2 behind Dave Rozema, and 3-2
behind the pitching of Mark Fidrych. The Bird give up a 2-run homer in the
first, but zeroes after that.

1979
The visiting Braves edge the Dodgers, 2-1, as Rick Matula picks up his
first major league win.

1980
In his first ML start, Cincinnati's Charlie Leibrandt shuts out the Braves,
5-0, at Riverfront.

The Majors see the first Q battery in history, when KC reliever Dan
Quisenberry is on the mound with Jamie Quirk behind the plate. The Tigers
win, 3-2.

1983
The Phillies, trailing by five runs entering the final frame, beat the Mets,
10-9, when Bo Diaz hits a walk-off bases-loaded homerun. The Philadelphia
catcher's 'ultimate grand slam', a homerun which wins a game when a team
is down by three runs in the bottom of the final inning, is tossed by Neil
Allen, who only faces the final batter. Pete Rose records his 700th double
and scores his 2000th run while the bright spots for the Mets are their 17
hits, including 3 homers. Bob Bailor and Dave Kingman hit back-to-back HRs.

1984
On the same date he got his first major league hit 21 years earlier, Pete
Rose, as a member of the Expos, doubles off Phillies hurler Jerry Koosman
for his 4000th hit becoming the first player in the National League to
reach the milestone. Montreal beats Philadelphia in the Friday the 13th
contest at Olympic Stadium, 5-1.

The red hot Tigers drop 8 runs on the Red Sox in the first inning at Boston
as all 3 outs in the frame are made by Lance Parrish. He strikes out and
grounds into a DP, though he later homers. Boston counters with 5 runs in
the bottom of the 1st, but Detroit hangs on for a 13-9 win.

1985
With his team down 7-4 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Mariners'
left fielder Phil Bradley erases the three-run deficit with a walk-off
grand slam. The game-ending round-tripper comes off Twins' closer Ron Davis,
who had given up a hit and two walks before surrendering the 'sayonara slam'.

Rollie Fingers records his 217th AL save in Milwaukee's 6-5 win over Texas,
breaking Sparky Lyle's record. Fingers already holds the ML record with 325.

In LA, Candy Maldonado knocks a pinch hit homerun in the 8th off the Giants'
Mark Davis for the game's only run. Fernando Valenzuela is the 1-0 winner.

1987
In San Diego's home opener, the Padres waste no time making up a two-run
first inning deficit when the first three batters in the bottom of the first
homer off of Giant starter Roger Mason. Marvell Wynn, Tony Gwynn and John
Kruk all go deep to establish a major league record. But the Giants come
back to win 13-6. The record will be matched in 2003.

Free-agent 3B Bob Horner, unable to find a ML club interested in his services,
signs a one-year contract with Japan's Yakult Swallows.

1988
Oakland's Rick Honeycutt becomes the 2nd pitcher in as many days to tie the
AL's 28-year-old balk record by committing 4 balks in 4 innings while saving a
12-7 win over Seattle. A ML-record 924 balks will be called this season after
umpires are instructed to interpret the "complete stop" rule more strictly.

1990
The first sellout in Mariners history occurs when 54,874 fans attend
the season home opener at the Kingdome. The Friday the 13th crowd leaves
disappointed when Seattle is routed by Oakland, 15-7.

1991
California's Dave Winfield collects 15 total bases and 6 RBIs on 3 HRs,
a double and single in the Halo's 15-9 win over the Twins.

1992

century that 2 unbeaten teams had met so late in the season. The Yankees
win by a score of 5-2.

1993

Smith passes Jeff Reardon to become the all-time career saves leader.
Smith preserves St. Louis' 9-7 win over the Dodgers.

The Tigers defeat the Athletics, 20-4. Rob Deer, Mickey Tettleton and Travis
Fryman each contribute 3-run homers. Detroit collects 18 hits and leaves
12 on base.

1994
Montreal P Pedro Martinez' bid for a perfect game, in only his 5th major
league start, goes down the tubes as he hits Reds OF Reggie Sanders on an 0-2
count with 1 out in the 8th inning. Sanders apparently thinks that Martinez
did it deliberately and charges the mound setting off a bench-clearing
brawl. When order is restored Martinez loses his no-hitter when Brian Dorsett
singles to lead off the 9th. He does not figure in the decision, as the
Reds rally to tie. Montreal wins, 3-2, with a run in the bottom of the inning.

Indians P Derek Lilliquist is credited with Cleveland's 6-5 win without
retiring a batter. With 2 outs in 9th of a 5-5 tie, the runner on 1B, Rex
Hudler, is thrown out trying to steal. The Indians go on to score in the
10th to win the game.

1995
The Tigers trade OF Tony Phillips to the Angels for OF Chad Curtis.

1996
After a lackluster loss in the Opener, Hideo Nomo is back on form as he
strikes out 17 Florida batters enroute to a 3-1 Dodger win. Billy Ashley
and Raul Mondesi homer for the Dodgers.

In Milwaukee, Michael Tucker's 3-run homer in the 5th inning - the only
hit allowed by knuckleballer Steve Sparks - is enough to give the Royals
a 3-2 win.

1997
In a Kid's Opening Day at Fenway, the Sox introduce their new furry mascot,
Wally the Green Monster. Wil Cordero bangs a HR off the coke bottle above
the LF wall, the first HR to hit the "caffeine monster", and Tim Naehring
adds a grand slam to pace Boston to a 7-1 win over Seattle.

1998
Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr slugs 2 HRs in a 6-5 loss to Cleveland. In doing
so, he becomes the second-youngest player in big league history to reach
300 homers for his career, at 28 years and 143 days. Jimmie Foxx, at 27
years 328 days, was the youngest.

Lee Stevens of the Rangers hits 3 HRs and drives in 4 in a 10-1 victory
over the Tigers.

Cardinals rookie C Eli Marrero returns to action after undergoing surgery
for the removal of a malignant tumor from his neck on March 6. He hits the
first pitch he sees for a triple, and also homers in the Cardinals 8-2 loss
to the Giants.

A steel joint, weighing several hundred pounds, falls through a roof panel
at Yankee Stadium, destroying a seat located between 3rd base and home
plate. Luckily, the Yankees are scheduled to play a night game, and no
fans are in the stadium at the time. Emergency inspections are scheduled,
and the game against the Angels is canceled. The final game of the series
will be played at Shea Stadium, while next week's series against the Tigers
is switched to Detroit.

1999
The Rangers defeat the Mariners, 15-6, as Texas C Ivan Rodriguez drives
in 9 runs. All of Rodriguez' RBIs come on a 3-run HR in the 1st inning,
a 2-run single in the 2nd and a grand slam in the 3rd. Mike Morgan picks up
the win in relief. It is his 1st victory over the Mariners since August 4,
1979. The 19 years, 8 months and 9 days is the longest a pitcher has ever
gone between victories against one team.

The Dodgers score 2 runs in the top of the 16th inning to take a 6-4 lead over
the Diamondbacks, but Arizona comes back with 3 in the bottom half to eke out
a 7-6 win. 2B Jay Bell has 4 hits, including a pair of HRs, for the winners.

2000
The Rockies defeat the Cardinals, 12-6, scoring 10 runs in the 2nd inning.

The Devil Rays obtain P Dwight Gooden from the Astros in exchange for cash.

2001
Texas scores 4 in the 1st against Oakland and 2 runs in each of the next 4
innings to roll over Oakland, 13-1. Rusty Greer and Randy Velarde lead off the
game with back-to-back homers. Alex Rodriguez and Andres Galarraga also homer.

2003
Is 13 bad luck? The Phillies score all 13 of their runs in the 4th inning
to set a new team mark, and trounce the Reds, 13-1.

2004
At SBC Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds hits his 661st career homer off
Brewers hurler Ben Ford to move up to third on the all-time homer career
list passing his godfather, Willie Mays, and leaving the 39-year-old Giant
left fielder 53 behind Babe Ruth (714) and needing 94 to tie Hank Aaron
(755). The historic blast, a 468-foot seventh inning splash which lands
in McCovey Cove, is fished out by Larry Ellison, a Giant fan who also also
caught No. 660 last night in a kayak and gave it to a grateful Bonds, but
the California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger-impersonator will keep this
wet souvenir. The Giants beat the Astros, 4-2. Marquis Grissom homers twice.

2005
A near-by pedestrian saves 8-year-old Patrick McCarthy from getting run
down by a truck as the child starts to run into Boston's Newbury Street
traffic. The hero, who prevents the tragic accident by putting out his arm
and saying 'Whoa, watch out, buddy,' turns out to be the boy's favorite
player, Yankee superstar Alex Rodriguez.

The Mariners defeat the Royals, 2-1, to give manager Mike Hargrove his
1,000th career victory. He is the 51st skipper in history to reach the mark.

2006
The Dodgers rout the Pirates, 13-5, with the help of 7 RBIs from reserve C
Cody Ross, who hits a grand slam and a 3-run HR in successive at bats. Ross
becomes one of the few MLers in history to begin his career by hitting
homers in each of his 1st two at-bats. The only other active player to
perform the feat was Craig Counsell in 1997-98.

2007
The Red Sox purchase right-hander Russ Meyer (1-6, 6.21) from the Reds. The
'Mad Monk' will only appear in two games for Boston, starting one, posting
a 5.40 ERA in 5 innings of work.

Carlos Lee hit three homers, including a grand slam, and drove in six runs,
helping Houston to a 9-6 win at Philadelphia.

2008
Construction workers at the new Yankee Stadium site dig up a Red Sox jersey
buried in concrete from the ballpark scheduled to be completed in 2009. The
tattered David Ortiz jersey, which will be auctioned off to raise money for
the Jimmy Fund, was buried by a Bronx construction worker, a Boston fan,
who had hoped to put a hex on the Bombers.

Reds hurler Johnny Cueto walks his first batter of the season ending a string
of 22 strikeouts without issuing a base-on-balls. The rookie right-hander
is the only post-1900 pitcher to fan as many as 18 batters without throwing
a ball four in his first two starts.

Joe Crede and Paul Konerko each hit grand slams for the White Sox against
the Tigers, the third time Chicago has had multiple grand slams in the same
game in its history.

2009
In a somber pre-game meeting, Philadelphia president David Montgomery informs
the players that Harry Kalas, who arrived at National Park with the players
on the team bus, collapsed in the broadcast booth and died shortly after
being taken to a nearby hospital. In tribute to the 73-year-old Hall of Fame
voice of the Phillies, center fielder Shane Victorino, first baseman Ryan
Howard and reliever Scott Eyre, prior to their 9-8 victory over Washington,
light up a cigarette and pass it around in honor of the broadcaster, whose
smoking habit was legendary.

In the LA home opener, Orlando Hudson completes his cycle with a sixth
inning triple down the right-field line in the team's 11-1 rout of the
Giants. The second baseman becomes the first Dodger to hit for the cycle
at Dodger Stadium, and the first franchise player to accomplish the feat
in a nine-inning game since Gil Hodges did it in 1949.

Nick Swisher, who throws 22 pitches allowing just one hit and one walk before
retiring the next three consecutive batters, including a swinging strikeout
of Gabe Kapler, becomes the first position player to pitch for the Yankees
since Wade Boggs took the mound in 1997. During the 15-5 rout by the Rays
at Tampa's Tropicana Field, the fun-loving first baseman volunteered to
pitch the eighth inning to help save the bullpen after starter Chien-Ming
Wang lasts only only one inning.

Jody Gerut, with the San Diego Padres, becomes the first player to open a
new ballpark with a leadoff homerun, as the Padres beat the New York Mets,
6-5, at Citi Field.

Chicago White Sox teammates Jermaine Dye and Paul Konerko both hit their
300th career homeruns in back-to-back plate appearances against the Detroit
Tigers in the second inning at Comerica Park, the first time that historic
homeruns were hit consecutively.

2011
Chipper Jones spoils Florida's bid for a shutout when he homers in the
bottom of the ninth inning of the Braves' 5-1 loss at Turner Field. The
Atlanta third baseman joins Eddie Murray (1,917) and Mickey Mantle (1,509)
in becoming only the third switch hitter in major league history to compile
1,500 RBIs.

A federal jury convicted Barry Bonds of a single charge of obstruction of
justice, but failed to reach a verdict on the three counts at the heart of
the allegations that he knowingly used steroids and human growth hormone
and lied to a grand jury about it.

2012
Josh Thole's bizarre base running blunder leads to a very odd double play
in the second inning of the Mets' 5-2 victory at Citizens Bank Park. After
successfully reaching second base on R.A. Dickey's sacrifice bunt, the
25-year-old Mets catcher shocks everyone, including the Philadelphia defense,
by trying to return to first base where he is tagged out to complete the
unusual 3-1-6-4 twin killing.

Aaron Harang, after surrendering a leadoff single to Cameron Maybin to start
the game, strikes out the next nine consecutive Padres in L.A.'s 9-8 victory
at Dodger Stadium. The 34-year-old right-hander's performance is one more than
Johnny Podres' franchise mark of 8, but falls one short of the major league
record held by Tom Seaver, who fanned 10 straight Friars for the Mets in 1970.

Matt Cain threw a one-hitter, allowing only a single by Pittsburgh pitcher
James McDonald in the sixth inning during a near-perfect performance as
the San Francisco Giants beat the Pirates 5-0 in their home opener.

2015
Jon Lester finally attempts a pickoff at first base, ending a streak that
covered a span of 66 appearances. The Cubs southpaw, who signed a six-year
free-agent deal worth $155 million to start for Chicago this season, last
threw over to first base on April 30, 2013 while pitching for the Red Sox.
