1901
Eight days after the Phillies' opener before 4,593, and after two days of
rain, Connie Mack's Athletics home opener at Columbus Park draws 16,000 for a
5-1 loss to the Washington Nationals. Chick Fraser is the winner. Nap Lajoie
has a groundout then 3 hits for the Athletics, and will go 3 for 3 tomorrow
on the way to an AL-record .422 batting average. In their inaugural season
in the Junior Circuit, the Mackmen will finish in fourth place, compiling
a 74-62 record.

After 6 postponements, the New York Giants down the Brooklyn Superbas, 5-3,
for their season's first win and Mathewson's first ML victory. Matty allows
4 hits and strikes out 8.

10-6. Iron Joe McGinnity strikes out 9 in the win, and Mike Donlin cracks
two triples off losing pitcher Win Kellum.

1902
In his major league debut, Bronchos (Indians) hurler, future Hall of
Famer Addie Joss tosses a one-hitter (fanning 4 of the first 6 batters)
beating the hometown Browns, 3-0 at Sportsman's Park. The only hit is a
scratch single by Jesse Burkett, which RF Zaza Harvey claims he caught. Ump
Bob Caruthers calls it a hit, a ruling that will irk Joss for years. The
22-year-old right-hander will post a 17-13 record along with a 2.77 ERA in
his rookie season with Cleveland.

Boston and Washington combine for 17 extra base hits, with Washington winning,
15-7. The Nationals have 3 homers, 4 doubles and a triple off Bill Dinneen
and Pep Deininger, making his pro debut. Pep will appear in one more game
before departing the majors.

1904
Ty Cobb, making his pro baseball debut at the age of seventeen, homers
and doubles for Augusta in the South Atlantic League in an 8-7 loss to
Columbus. The Tourists, however, will release the 'Georgia Peach' two days
into the season.

1905
Jack McCarthy ties the ML record and sets the NL record when he becomes
the 2nd OF to start 3 DPs (Jackson "Candy" Nelson in 1887, started 3 DPs,
but only 2 were completed at home, in a UA game) in one game, preserving
the 2-1 Chicago Cubs victory over the Pirates. All three DPs, including the
game-ending DP, are at home plate to catcher Jack O'Neill, who sets a ML
record for participating in 3 double plays ... the record will be broken
by Chris Hoiles. The 36-year-old McCarthy will play just 37 games in the
OF. The last to throw 3 out at home was Jim Jones on June 30, 1902. The
AL record for 3 DPs started by an outfielder in one game will not be set
until Ira Flagstead on April 19, 1926.

Barney Dreyfuss, claiming the fans want to see more hitting, calls for
abolishing the spitball. But it will remain legal until 1920.

1906
Immediately following the Giants 4-3 win over Philadelphia, John McGraw
slugs a fan who had made a derogatory remark about the Giants. Then the
manager proceeds on to the clubhouse. When a policeman arrives he refuses
to arrest McGraw on the grounds that he had not witnessed the altercation.

1907
At soggy Baker Bowl, Mathewson scatters 9 hits to beat the Phils, 4-3,
in 8 innings. The Giants tally 14 hits, led by Spike Shannon's four. New
York bats in the 9th without scoring, and the Phils put the tying run on 2B
before the rain pours down. Umpire Charles Rigler then calls the game. The
Giants have now won two in a row, but the streak will grow.

Boston OF Johnny Bates hits for the cycle to lead his Nationals to a 4-2
win over Brooklyn.

1909

The Giants jump on four Brooklyn pitchers and roll to an 11-5 victory. The
final Brooklyn twirler, Norman Plitt, allows one run in 2 innings and is
1 for 1 with a run scored. After this one ML appearance, Plitt will quit
baseball next month but will be reinstated by the National Commission a
year from now. Then he will find himself on the ineligible list in 1922 for
violations of the reserve obligations. In March of 1922, Plitt and six others
are ruled ineligible but can be reinstated if they disassociate themselves
with baseball for a year. Plitt's next ML appearance will be in 1927.

In the Browns 7-6 win over Chicago, Sox 2B Eddie Collins plays in his 473
straight game, a new AL record. He tied Sam Crawford's mark in his last game,
on April 22nd.

1919
In St. Louis, rookie Art Reinhart makes his first appearance for the Cardinals
in the third inning with St. Louis trailing the Reds, 4-0. The first batter
he faces is Heinie Groh and Reinhart hits him on the hand with his first
pitch. Manager Branch Rickey then yanks him and Reinhart will not be back
in the majors until 1925. Dolf Luque is the winner over Bill Doaks.

1920
In Washington, Red Sox SS Everett Scott plays in his 534th consecutive game,
a major league record. The previous mark was 533, set by the Phillies Fred
Luderus. The Nationals win, 2-0, as Joe Johnson outduels Bush.

1921
Cleveland clears its bench in a failed attempt to beat the Tigers. Detroit
wins, 9-8, as Cleveland uses 23 players including 7 pitchers. Jim Bagby is
the winner.

1922
Detroit stops the Browns and Ken Williams, 2-0. Ray Kolp is the winning
pitcher.

1923
The Giants receive their 1922 WS rings, then beat the Braves 7-3 in their
home opener, despite a record-tying 5 double plays by Boston. Giants 1B
George "Highpockets" Kelly ties a record, handling 22 chances in the field.

1925
With the Indians leading 7-2 at Chicago, the umps forfeit the game to
Cleveland when the crowd storms onto the field and refuse to get off.

1927
In Boston, forty-year-old Ty Cobb is the whole show as he has 3 hits for
the A's, scores 2, drives in the winning run, and steals home in the 7th
inning. He tops that off with a 9th-inning shoestring catch in shallow
RF and then nabs Jacobson off first for an unassisted DP to end the game,
a 9-8 squeaker over Boston. It is the 2nd unassisted DP in Cobb's career
and his 2nd steal of home this month.

1928
Behind Jack Quinn's 10-0 shutout over the Senators, the A's hit two bases
loaded triples to tie a record. Tris Speaker does it in the 3rd and Ty Cobb
matches him in the 6th.

In an Iowa prep game, Atlantic High School beats Griswold High School
like a rented mule, winning, 109-0 in a no hitter. Atlantic has 92 hits,
including 26 doubles, 7 triples and 16 homeruns in a prep school record
for embarrassment. (as noted by Kevin Saldana).

1930
The undefeated Giants take a pair from the Phillies, winning 13-2 and
7-5. Hub Pruett and Carl Hubbell are the victors. Fred Lindstrom is 5 for
5 in the lid lifter and 2 for 4 in the nitecap, while Bill Terry and Travis
Jackson each pound out a pair of homers.

Benny Frey beats the Cubs, 1-0, for his 2nd win over Chicago in a week. The
rookie will beat them 5 times this year on his way to leading the NL in
losses with 18.

1931
Dusty Cooke, Yankee RF, separates his shoulder diving for a fly ball off
the bat of Ossie Bluege of Washington, and 1B Gehrig winds up chasing the
ball, which becomes an inside-the-park HR. With Babe Ruth still sidelined,
the shorthanded Yankees send P Red Ruffing to the outfield. The game's
most significant play comes with Lyn Lary on base when Lou Gehrig's drive
into the CF stands at Washington bounces back and is caught by CF Harry
Rice. According to the rules, this is a homerun, but when Lary sees Rice
catching the ball, he thinks it's the final out of the inning. Unnoticed
by Joe McCarthy, coaching at 3B, Lary heads for the dugout after crossing
3B. Gehrig circles the bases, but he is called out and gets credit for a
triple instead of a HR and loses 2 RBI. As a result Gehrig will end the
season tied for the HR title with Babe Ruth at 46 and will have "only"
184 RBI. The Yanks also lose the game, 9-7, and McCarthy will do no more
coaching at the bases this season. Gehrig's triple also means that at the
year's end the majors will collect 1,070 triples, one more than the two
leagues will total in homers (1,069). It will be the last season that there
are more triples than homers. For Cooke, the injury ends his season at 27
games and a .333 batting average. The injury will cut down his effectiveness
and after just 3 appearances next year, he'll be traded to Boston.

1935
Washington beats Boston, 10-4, and the Sox help with 5 infield errors,
3 by Joe Cronin. A disgusted Lefty Grove leaves in the 7th.

1936
In a ragged game featuring 11 errors, the Dodgers overcome 7 errors to beat
the Phils, 10-7. Adding to the miscues, Brooklyn SS Ben Geraghty reaches
base twice on interference (tipped bat) by Philadelphia C Earl Grace for
a ML record.

At Boston, the Red Sox score six runs in the bottom of the first inning, but
the Yankees rebound with 7 in the 2nd. New York holds on to win, 12-9. Foxx
and Gehrig match homers while Frank Crosetti is 5 for 6 and Bill Dickey 4
for 6.

1938
The Reds overcome a 7-0 deficit to defeat the visiting Cardinals, 8-7, in
10 innings. The Reds score 3 in the 7th, 4 in the 8th, and the winner in the
10th on a single by Lew Riggs. The Birds offense is headed by P Curt Davis,
who hits a grand slam off Hollingsworth, the first slam by a Cards pitcher
since Mike O'Neill hit a pinch slam on June 3, 1902.

1940
Yankee Red Rolfe has nine assists at 3B against Boston, but the Red Sox
win 8-1.

The Giants send slow-footed slugger Zeke Bonura back to the Senators for
P Rene Monteagudo and $10,000.

1941
The Chicago Cubs are the first team to install an organ within a
ballpark. With Roy Nelson at the keyboard, the Cubs hit sour notes, losing
6-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals' Max Lanier. Nelson has to stop playing at
2:30 when the radio pregame shows began. Rules at the time forbade songs
from the ASCAP song publishing service from being played over the radio -
even in the background - without compensation.

1942
Before a crowd of 48,631 at the Polo Grounds, the Giants lose a pair to the

Alvin Montgomery, a catcher on the Braves training roster, is killed in an
auto crash.

In the first of two games against Montreal (International League), Baltimore

1947
Bob Feller shuts out the Tigers to give the Tribe a 6-0 win. Hal Newhouser
takes the loss.

Tribe comes back to win 12-11 in 14 innings. Cleveland scores 2 in the
9th to tie. Lou Boudreau paces a 22-hit attack with 5 safeties, including
a pair of doubles and a pair of triples. Christopher is the winner with 5
innings of shutout relief.

1949
With the help of a triple play, Preacher Roe pitches the Dodgers into 1st
place with a 5-2 win over the Braves and Johnny Sain. LF Gene Hermanski
homers in the 1st and starts the 7-4-3 TP (Jackie Robinson and Gil Hodges)
in the 3rd after catching Al Dark's short fly. It is the only triple play
in Brooklyn Dodgers history

1951
Connie Marrero of Washington allows just one hit - a homer by the A's
Barney McCosky - in topping Philadelphia, 2-1. Joe Coleman is the loser,
serving up solo homers to Mickey Vernon and Gil Coan.

1952

Feasting again on Pirates pitching, the Phillies' Connie Ryan goes 5 for 5 in
a 7-5 win in the first game of a doubleheader. Robin Roberts celebrates his

Sadaharu Oh hits the first round-tripper of his world record 868 home
runs. The Japanese first baseman will play his entire 22-year career with
the Yomiuri Giants of the Central League in Nippon Professional Baseball.

Was it something I said? Reds pitcher Willard Schmidt is twice hit by pitches
in the 3rd inning in an 11-10 win over the Braves. Braves pitchers Bob
Rush and Lew Burdette do the plunking. It is a first in the major leagues,
but the ML mark will be tied in 3 years by Frank Thomas and later by Brady
Anderson. But Schmidt will likely remain the only batter to hit and be hit
twice in an inning. While on the mound in the 4th inning, Schmidt is hit
again when a Johnny Logan line drive strikes him on the right hand and he
has to leave the game. The two teams use 14 pitchers between them to tie a
NL record, with the 8 pitchers by the Reds tying another NL record. Warren
Spahn is tagged for the loss, his 2nd in 2 days to the Reds.

Surprising Baltimore sweeps a pair from the Yankees, coming from behind to
score 2 in the 9th and win the opener, 5-4, and scoring in the final frame
of the nitecap to win, 3-2. The O's use 6 pinch hitters in the opener,
while New York uses 4 for a new ML mark. Hoyt Wilhelm goes the distance in
the nitecap, but his knuckler proves elusive for Gus Triandos, who ties
the ML record with 4 passed balls. Ray Katt, who was the lone holder of
the record, also caught Wilhelm.

Los Angeles move into first place ahead of the Braves with a 17-11 win over

blast off Paul Foytack begins the Yankee right fielder's historic quest of
the single season homerun record. Mickey Mantle adds HRs from both sides
of the plate (for the 8th time). Mantle's 2nd homer, a 2-run shot off Hank
Aguirre, snaps a 10-10 tie in the 10th.

Cincinnati's Jerry Lynch becomes the 6th player in NL history to hit 2
consecutive pinch-hit HRs. This one today is not enough as Chicago wins 3-2.

1962
Catcher Harry Chiti is traded to the Mets from the Indians for a player
to be named later. In June, New York sends the backstop to Cleveland to
complete the deal.

The Cardinals and Colts play a 17-inning 5-5 tie in a game halted by curfew.

1969
The Baseball Records Committee says Babe Ruth should be credited with 715
HRs, because a hit on July 8, 1918 recognized as a triple should have been
ruled a HR. The recommendation is ignored.

The Red Sox beat the Tigers, 7-4, with Carl Yastrzemski hitting a pair of
homers - one a grand slam. Yaz' blows give the Sox a record for most homers
in 10 straight games with 26.

the hidden ball trick (as noted by Bill Deane).

Bob Gibson strikes out 15 and allows 5 hits as the Cards beat the visiting
Reds, 4-1.

The Cubs win their 10th straight, beating the Astros, 6-3, on 3 home

to back Arthur Rhodes.

and holding up the action for 17 minutes. Montreal eventually wins the game
by a score of 6-2.

up for the opener, the smallest opening day crowd at the Stadium since
1990. The Yankees start with a win, 8-6, over the Rangers, as Jimmy Key
goes 5 innings to pick up the win. It is his 3rd straight opener and his
Opening Day record is 6-0. Kenny Rogers is the loser, giving up 4 runs in
3 innings, including a homer to Danny Tartabull. Bernie Williams also homers.

At Kansas City, the Royals' Kevin Appier is lifted after 6 2/3 innings of
no hit ball. Appier had thrown just 11 1/3 innings in spring training and

he exits and the Royals win 5-1. Nolan Ryan, in the 1990 opener, also was
lifted in a no hitter because of limited work in spring training.

Toronto scores 11 runs in the 2nd inning and coasts home to a 13-1 win over

In the Cubs' 7-6 win over the Pirates at Wrigley Field, Ryne Sandberg hits
his 2nd homer of the season and the 267th in his career as a second baseman

home plate. It's the 200th HR of his career. Randy Johnson goes 7 innings
allowing 2 hits and striking out 10.

2005
With three homeruns during his first three trips to the plate, Alex Rodriguez
becomes only the 11th major league player to bat in 10 or more runs in a
game. The highest paid player in baseball history is one RBI shy of the
American League record of 11 set by fellow Yankee Tony Lazzeri in 1936 and
two short of the major league mark of 12 shared by Jim Bottomley (1924)
and Mark Whiten (1993) of the Cardinals. Today the Yankees pound the Angels,
12-4. Rodriguez also has a single.

The Blue Jays defeat the Devil Rays, 7-5. TB starter Dewon Brazelton takes
the loss, giving him a lifetime record of 0-13 on the road. He is the first
pitcher in 56 years to begin his career with that many consecutive road
losses. Cincinnati's Kent Peterson did so in 1947-49.

2006
In a game which included getting a whack on the top of the head by Shawn
Green's bat, Mike Piazza becomes the 41st major leaguer to collect 400
career homeruns by hitting a dinger in the 9th inning. The Padres backstop
also extended his record for most homeruns by a catcher to 377.

Francisco Cordero blows his third consecutive chance to save a game as the
A's tie the game 4-4 in the ninth and then score two in the next frame to
beat the Rangers, 6-4. The Dominican closer's fifth blown save establishes
a big league mark for the first month of the season, and overshadows Kevin
Mench's grand slam which makes it the sixth straight game the outfielder
has hit a homer which also sets a team record.

The Royals defeat the Twins, 3-1. Minnesota becomes the 3rd team in AL
history to trail in each of their first 20 games of the season, joining
the 1910 Browns (28) and 1988 Orioles (21).

Barry Bonds hits a 2-out 2-run pinch homer in the 9th to give the Giants a
7-7 tie with the Mets, but the New Yorkers score a pair in the 11th to win,
9-7. Barry lines out to end the game. Earlier, Julio Franco hit a 2-run pinch
single, then swipes 2B, the oldest player in 97 years to steal a base. Arlie
Latham, a player-coach for the New York Giants set the record by swiping
a bag on August 18, 1909 in a 14-1 laugher when he was 49 years old.

The Reds shutout the Nationals, 5-0, as Bronson Arroyo, Kent Mercker, and
David Weathers combine for a 1-hitter. Ryan Zimmerman's 4th inning single
is Washington's only hit.

In Creighton's 9-1 loss to the Kansas Jayhawks, Creighton reliever Pat
Venditte tosses two perfect innings. The ambidextrous Venditte retires six
batters, three right-handed and three left-handed, and records a strikeout
with each arm. Nick Czyz allows one hit in the win.

2008
Brad Penny's 96-mph fastball is missed by Dodger battery mate Russell
Martin and knocks out umpire Kerwin Danley. After the players are asked to
leave the field, the home plate arbitrator, who lost consciousness briefly,
is placed on a stretcher and leaves the Dodgers-Rockies game in an ambulance.

Sara Tucholsky, a Western Oregon college senior, goes deep over the
centerfield fence, but suffers a torn knee ligament rounding first and is
unable to continue her trip around the bases. Any assistance from her team
while she is an active runner will turn the three-run homer into a two-run
single and an out, but just as she is about to be removed from the field,
Central Washington senior Mallory Holtman comes forward along with other
opposing players to carry the injured opponent around the bases in the
ultimate display of sportsmanship.

On Ralph Kiner Day, Alhambra dedicates a bronze statue in honor of its native
son for his "accomplishments and contributions to the game of professional
baseball and sports broadcasting". The former Pirates slugger, a member of
the Hall of Fame, spent his youth in the California city and graduated from
its local high school in 1940.

Vin Scully receives an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Pepperdine
University in Malibu, the institution's highest honor. The Dodgers' Hall
of Fame broadcaster delivers a stirring commencement address to the 2008
Class of Seaver College telling the graduates that achieving dreams may be
"very difficult, but possible".

2011
On the first pitch he sees in the major leagues, Alexi Amarista strokes
a two-run double in the bottom of the second inning of the Angels' 8-3
victory over Oakland. The 22-year-old rookie second baseman dedicates the
hit to the memory of his dad, who was murdered five months ago during a
home-invasion robbery in his Venezuelan hometown of Barcelano Anzoategu.

2012
Using a starting lineup that is totally home grown for the first time since
1971, New York completes a three-game sweep of Miami when Heath Bell walks
four batters in the ninth inning, including Justin Turner's 13-pitch at-bat
that results in a game-tying bases-loaded base-on-balls, and then gives
up a game-winning two-out single to the rookie Kirk Nieuwenhuis with the
bases loaded. Forty-one years ago, Gil Hodges used a lineup of all former
Mets farmhands that included Ed Kranepool, Bud Harrelson, Tim Foli, Ted
Martinez, Mike Jorgensen, Duffy Dyer, John Milner and Jerry Koosman.

2013
Anibal Sanchez breaks Mickey Lolich's franchise record of 16 strikeouts when
he retires the side on strikes in the eighth inning of the Tigers' 10-0
rout of Atlanta. In his eight innings of work, the 29-year-old Venezuelan
right-hander will give up just five hits enroute to his 17-strikeout
performance in the Comerica Park contest.

2017
Gift Ngoepe becomes the first player born and raised in Africa to make his
major-league debut when he appears in the lineup as part of a double switch in
the Pirates’ 6-5 over the Cubs at PNC Park. The 27-year-old second baseman,
who hails from Pietersburg, South Africa, hits safely in his first at-bat,
sending a single up the middle off Jon Lester in the fourth inning.
