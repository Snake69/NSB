1901
Although he tried to return the money, Christy Matthewson is accused by Connie
Mack of reneging on his contract with Philadelphia. In January, 'Big Six',
after meeting with the A's manager, received a signing bonus, committing
himself to play for the 1901 season with the American League team, but then
used the offer as leverage to get a richer contract from the Giants. Mack
considers going to court, but eventually accepts the loss of the pitcher.

1902
The NL names club owners Arthur Soden, John T. Brush and James Hart as an
interim committee to run the league.

1923
Expelled players Happy Felsch and Swede Risberg file suit against the White
Sox for back salary of $6,750 and $400,000 in damages, but their suit will
be unsuccessful. Both players were acquitted for allegedly fixing the 1919
World Series, but were still banned from baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw
Mountain Landis, even though they were found not guilty of wrong doing in
a much-publicized court case.

1924
In Ashville, the first game ever played in McCormick Field is a smashing
success as the visiting Detroit Tigers beat the Ashville Skylanders,
18-14. A sparse crowd of 3199 watches as Harry Heilmann bangs 3 homers,
two off the top of the LF grandstand. Ty Cobb adds a homer. When the Dodgers
leave Ebbets Field, the scoreboard will be relocated to McCormick Field.

Goose Goslin, released by Detroit, returns for his 3rd stint with the
Senators.

1950

be out until June 6th but his career will be effectively ended.

1966
Tom Seaver, University of Southern California pitcher, signs with the Mets for
a reported $50,000 bonus. A selection of the Braves in the January free-agent
draft, Seaver was signed by Atlanta's Richmond farm club a month later,
after USC had begun its baseball schedule. The violation netted Richmond
a $500 fine and forbade Atlanta from signing Seaver for 3 years. However,
Seaver was also declared ineligible at the college level, and Tom's father
threatens a lawsuit, so an unprecedented special draft is held. Three clubs
willing to match Richmond's $40,000 contract - the Indians, Phillies and
Mets - participate. New York's name is drawn from a hat as the winner.

1968
The Tigers trade left-hander Hank Aguirre to the Dodgers for a player to
be named later, minor leaguer Fred Moulder. The All-Star southpaw, better
known for being the worst hitter in major league history, will compile an
.085 batting average during his 16-year major league career, striking out
an astounding 61% of his 388 at-bats.

1969

tosses out the first ball and Kansas City opens with a 4-2 win over the
Yankees. The threat of snow holds the crowd to just 10,006. Bud Black,
with relief help from Quisenberry, tops Ron Guidry, still winless in
Openers. Onyx Concepcion hits Guidry's first pitch of the game for a homer,
while Dave Winfield has a two-run homer for New York.

The owners' proposal of expanding the 1985 League Championship Series from the
best-of-five games to best-of-seven is agreed to by the Players' Association.

for at least 3 months and not have his first hit until September.

1987
The Cubs trade veteran pitcher Dennis Eckersley (6-11) and minor leaguer
Dan Rohn to the A's for 3 minor leaguers. Eckersley made his only relief
appearance of the year on June 24th, and his first out of the bullpen
after 301 starts. For the A's, Eckersley will perform brilliantly as a
full-time reliever.

At Tiger Stadium, Jack Morris makes his 8th straight start for Detroit
and is booed by the 51,315 for his attempts to leave the Tigers over the
winter. The Yankees and Tigers each score one run in 9 innings before New
York scores in the 10th to beat Morris, 2-1. Dave Righetti, in relief of
Dennis Rasmussen, is the winner.

1989
In his first major league at-bat, Mariners' center fielder Ken Griffey Jr
doubles off of Oakland's Dave Stewart, but the Athletics beat the Mariners,
3-2. Mark McGwire homers for the A's. The 19-year-old 'Junior', the son of
an active major leaguer outfielder playing with the Reds, will establish
himself as one of the game's superstars before retiring in 2010.

The Mets win their 11th consecutive home opener 8-4 over St. Louis at Shea

Gooden is the winner, helped by a homerun by Howard Johnson.

1991
Nolan Ryan and his son, Reid, pitch against each other as the Rangers take
on the University of Texas. Reid, a 19-year-old freshman, gives up 4 runs in

1994
At Riverfront Stadium in a game that is not embraced by the local fans
or Cincinnati owner Marge Schott, the new season begins with the first
Sunday night opener ever played in major league history. On a frigid Easter
Sunday evening, the Cardinals beat the Reds in the controversial contest,
6-4, in front of the smallest opening day crowd in the ballpark's 24-year
history. Cardinals OF Ray Langford hits a HR as the first batter of the
1994 season. Bob Tewksbury gains the win.

1996
The San Diego Padres beat the Chicago Cubs, 7-5, with Joey Hamilton lasting
five innings to notch his first win of the year and his first hit in three
seasons. Hamilton had been 0 for 57 at the plate, one of the worst offensive
starts in ML history. Tony Gwynn is 4 for 4, while Caminiti has 4 RBIs,
3 on a HR. Brad Ausmus, Wally Joyner, Scott Servais and Sammy Sosa all hit
homers. Frank Castillo is the loser.

record of 40 straight wins established by the Division II school last year.

Ken Griffey Jr makes his regular season debut in a Cincinnati Reds
uniform. The Reds and the Milwaukee Brewers play to a 3-3 tie in a game the
umpires call due to rain in the sixth inning. It is the first tie game on
Opening Day in 35 years.

In their opener, the Texas Rangers defeat the Chicago White Sox, 10-4, as OF
Gabe Kapler becomes the first player to homer in his first two at-bats as
a Ranger. Catcher Ivan Rodriguez also hits two homers for Texas before the
largest regular-season crowd in the team's history. Ranger starter Kenny
Rogers ties Frank Viola for third place in consecutive home wins with
the victory over Mike Sirotka. Rogers has won 19 consecutive home games
and hasn't lost on his own turf since June 28, 1997, a span of 1,012 days
(through April 4). Ray Kremer of the Pittsburgh Pirates holds the record
of 22 consecutive home wins set in 1926-27. Lefty Grove of Boston (1938-41)

6-5 over the host Angels. Drese allows 3 runs in 5 2/3 innings as the Tribe
takes the rubber game.

Playing at home, the Oakland Athletics lose to the Texas Rangers, 9-6,
as the Rangers score 3 in the 8th. The loss snaps the A's string of 20

1974-75 Cincinnati Reds for most consecutive home wins over two seasons;
the Reds mark was 17.

in memory of Bill King, their lead radio announcer since 1981. The patch
features a microphone emblazoned with King's name and his signature call,
"Holy Toledo."

will wear a left-sleeve arm patch featuring a microphone and the initials
"TC."

2007

Merkin Valdez beginning the game on the mound and the announced starter,
and eventual winner, Tim Lincecum, entering the game in the fourth inning.

At Comerica Park in Detroit the Royals beat the Tigers, 4-1, completing a

In a dazzling debut, Reds right-hander Johnny Cueto fans 10 batters in an
overpowering seven-inning performance when Cincinnati beats the visiting

strikes out eight of the first 13 Arizona batters he faces.

During a tour of Fenway Park with her classmates, a Memorial Boulevard
Middle School student is attacked by a 3 1/2-pound red-tailed hawk known to
nest at the historic ballpark. The 13-year-old eighth grader from Bristol,

hospital, has a familiar name to Red Sox fans, Alexa Rodriguez, similar to the
much detested third baseman of the Yankees, who also is 13 (uniform number).

2009
The Mets, obligated only to pay the major league minimum of $400,000, sign

in the week despite having $14 million left on his contract.

held to announce the deal prior to an exhibition game in Houston.

2011

score his team's first 3 runs in a season off solo homeruns.

2019

Yermin Mercedes of the White Sox became the first player in Major League
modern history to record eight hits in his first eight at-bats of the season
with his first three hits today against the Angels. His streak ended when

start a season during the Expansion Era (dating back to 1961) at seven
during the 1997 season.
