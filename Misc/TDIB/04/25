over the Milwaukee Brewers. (The contest is the American League's first game
in Detroit.) Detroit spots the Brewers a 13-3 lead - 7-0 after 3 innings - by
making 7 errors, including three by SS Kid Elberfeld. Tiger 1B Pop Dillon hits
4 doubles, tying the ML record, including a pair in the record 9th inning,

victories he'll record this season.

In Philadelphia, Boston's Cy Young pitches 8 innings and allows 6 hits in
losing to the A's Rube Waddell, 2-0. Young allows no hits in making the

two-run homer to lead Brooklyn to a 5-3 win over the Giants. In the 10th
inning of the nitecap, Giants pinch-hitting specialist Moose McCormick is
called upon to get a hit twice in one at-bat. With the winning run on base,
he singles to win the game. But umpire Bill Klem says his back was turned
and he didn't see it, so McCormick has to try again. This time Moose hits
into a double play. Darkness ends the scoreless game after 11 innings.

In a 5-4 loss to the Senators, Red Sox pitcher Tom O'Brien ties the AL record
by striking out 6 consecutive batters. Bill Donovan set the mark in 1908.

1933
Yankees rookie hurler Russ Van Atta goes 4 for 4 and shuts out the Senators,
16-0, in his major league debut.

Philadelphia shortstop Dick Bartell becomes the first major leaguer to stroke
four consecutive doubles in a nine-inning game. Rowdy Richard's quartet
of two-baggers help the Phillies defeat the Braves at the Baker Bowl,
7-1. Spud Davis adds a two-run homer to make it easy for Ed Holly.

Russ Van Atta makes a spectacular debut in the Yankees 16-0 pasting of
the eventual AL-winning Senators, getting 4 hits and pitching a 5-hit
shutout. Only Casey Stengel has debuted with 4 hits. Van Atta will post a 12-4
record for the season, bat .283, but will injure his left index finger in
December while rescuing a cocker spaniel from a house fire. His only career
shutout is today. The game is marred by a wild 20-minute free-for-all in
the 4th inning started when Ben Chapman slides into second and spikes 2B
Buddy Myer. Myer initiated the spiking by stepping on Gehrig's foot at 1B
a few days earlier. Chapman, Myer and Earl Whitehill are suspended 5 days
and fined $100 each.

to the Braves at the Polo Grounds. The 25-year-old southpaw, who loses the
contest due to the Giants poor defense in the ninth inning, will hold the
rookie record for K's in debut until Dodger freshman Karl Spooner whiffs
15 batters in his first major league start in 1955.

1940
Dizzy Dean allows 2 runs in the 1st, but settles down to win 4-2 over the
Reds. The Cubs beat Paul Derringer, who loses for the first time after

year, the same date Diz recorded his last win.

1943
Rufe Gentry of Buffalo (International League) wins an 11-inning no-hitter
against Newark 1-0. The last IL no-hitter of this length was thrown by
Toronto's Urban Shocker on July 22, 1916.

1945
Baseball writers cannot seem to get any Hall of Fame candidates past the 75
percent requirement, but a committee selected to bring in some old-timers
succeeds with a group of turn-of-the-century names:  Jimmy Collins, Roger
Bresnahan, Fred Clarke, Dan Brouthers, Ed Delahanty, Hugh Jennings, Mike
"King" Kelly, Jim O'Rourke, Wilbert Robinson and Hugh Duffy. Collins,

and John McGraw.

a flying bat during the fourth inning of the April 25 tilt with New Orleans,

of Pete Layden, Pel outfielder." [Layden is a former All American football
star at the University of Texas.] (noted by Willie Runquist)

1948
Larry Doby ties a major league record by striking out five times in one
game. The Indians right-fielder's performance doesn't hurt the Tribe when

the roof of the LF stands, just the 10th player to do it.

1970
Tiger P Earl Wilson fans for the 3rd out in the 7th inning against the
Twins. On the 3rd strike by Jim Kaat, Twins C Paul Ratliff traps the ball in
the dirt, and must either throw to 1B or tag the batter. Instead he rolls
the ball back to the mound, ignoring the fact that ump John Rice has not
signaled a K. As the Twins head for their dugout, Wilson begins running the
bases and is around 3B when OF Brant Alyea retrieves the ball and throws
to SS Leo Cardenas, who is standing by home. Wilson turns back to 3B but

of relief. Cubs starter Rick Reuschel pitches the first six innings and
records 4 assists and 3 putouts. The 3 putouts come in the 3rd inning,
setting a since-tied NL record. Jim Bagby was the first pitcher to do it,
in 1940, with the Red Sox.

1976
During the fourth inning of the game being played at Dodger Stadium, Rick
Monday becomes a national hero when he takes away an American Flag about to be
set on fire by two trespassers (a father and son) in the outfield. The Cubs'
30-year-old fly chaser, who served six years in the Marine Reserves, will
be presented the flag a month later in a pre-game ceremony at Wrigley Field

as an intern in the team's front office.

Cleveland's Wayne Garland, who signed a $2.3 million 10-year contract a year
earlier, earns his 2nd and final win of the season, 6-5, over Toronto. Garland

May 5th and win only 13 more ML games.

Hoping to give his pitchers an edge, Maury Wills gets the Kingdome's ground
crew to enlarge the batter box making it a foot closer to the mound. The

shares his suspicions with the umpire, Bill Kunkel, and the exposed Mariners
manager is suspended for two games.

notes, the play goes "7 1/2 to 4 to 5 to 6." Bell reaches on an infield
single and Van Slyke follows with a double for the only run. Tomlin (4-0)
is the winner over Greg Maddux (3-1).

1994

1995
The 234-day strike ends. The 1st game of the 144-game season pits the Dodgers
against the Marlins. LA wins, 8-7, but the game is played with replacement
umpires, as the regular umps continue to be locked out. Opening day games
see fan protests regarding the strike spill onto the field. In addition,

to end early, forced the cancellation of World Series, and delayed the
opening of this season.

1996
The Mets bang 3 homers in the 7th and score 8 runs to bury the Cardinals,

Ken Griffey Jr hits three homeruns, two off Roger Clemens and one off Mike

homers this month breaking the record for the most round-trippers hit in
April. Griffey had a 3 homer game in May of last year.

The Indians establish a team record hitting eight homeruns in one game when
Matt Williams (3), David Justice (2), Manny Ramirez, Sandy Alomar, and Chad
Curtis all go deep in an 11-4 rout of the Brewers at County Stadium. With

1999
The fifth monument in Yankee Stadium history is unveiled as a tribute to
Joe DiMaggio, who died last month at the age of 84. "Joltin' Joe" becomes

in 1988. The big-leaguer who hit the most birthday blasts over his career
was Al Simmons with five.

2000

April. Dave Stewart of Texas did so in 1984.

2004
Little League Baseball grants its northern Virginia district jurisdiction
over the planet Mars. The idea is the brainchild of district Administrator

to get kids excited about science and technology, he successfully petitioned
Little League to annex the planet into the northern Virginia district.

in 9 chances, tying the ML record for saves by a rookie in April. KC's Mike
MacDougal set the mark in 2003. The win goes to Keith Foulke, who pitches
one inning in relief of Curt Schilling, who throws 133 pitches in 6 2/3
innings. David Ortiz homers in the 7th and Manny Ramirez hits a 3-run homer
in the 8th.

The Mets top the Giants, 5-1, as Barry Bonds hits #710. He is now four
homers behind Ruth.

2007
In a sixteen strikeout performance against the Diamondbacks in a 3-2 Padres
loss at Chase Field, Jake Peavy comes within one check swing from tying Tom
Seaver's major league record of ten consecutive strikeouts. The right-hander
loses his bid to tie the mark when Eric Byrnes' apparent swing on a 3-2
count is ruled a ball four, a questionable call by the first base umpire
Jeff Kellogg.
