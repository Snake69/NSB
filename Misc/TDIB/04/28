1901
Veteran SS Hugh Jennings, teammate and roommate of John McGraw in Baltimore's
great days, will play for Mack's Athletics after getting his law degree at
Cornell. McGraw persuades him to play for Baltimore instead, touching off
a royal battle with Connie Mack and Ban Johnson. The result is ill feelings
that never heal. Jennings winds up playing for the Phillies.

At Chicago's South Side Park, Cleveland's rookie pitcher Charles "Bock" Baker
gives up an AL record 23 singles in a 13-1 loss to the White Stockings. Bock
will pitch only one other game, also a loss, in the ML, and that will be
in 2 weeks with the Athletics. Bock's 23 singles allowed is short of the
ML-record of 28, set by Jack Wadsworth in 1894.

1902
Outfielder Jimmy Sheckard of the AL Baltimore Orioles jumps the team and
returns to the NL, the first American Leaguer to jump to the NL. In his
short stay in the AL, Sheckard had been constantly razzed by fans about
his contract jumping. White Sox president Comiskey says, "We don't want
Sheckard in our league. He has broken too many contracts." President Tom
Daly of the Ball Players' Protective Association echoes the sentiments. "Our
organization is unalterably opposed to such tactics as Sheckard has made
use of. I am glad he has gone back to Brooklyn, for while he is a great
ball player and a nice fellow personally we do not countenance violating
a written contract as he has done. I suppose (Ned) Hanlon scared him into
jumping." With Sheckard (and his $1,000 signing bonus gone) Orioles manager
John McGraw will play 3B with Kelly moving to CF.

In Chicago, Cleveland's Dummy Taylor shuts out the White Stockings, 2-0. Many
of the Cubs players are on hand to watch the former Giant pitcher beat

homers. Wiltse is the winner.

fence the Washington ace has allowed ... there have been two inside-the-park
homers hit of Walter.

1915
The Tigers trim the Browns, 12-3, scoring 10 runs in the 8th. James walks
4 Tigers in the 3rd but, despite giving up a triple steal (Cobb, Crawford
and Leach), allows just one run in the inning. Cobb will steal home six
times this season.

The New York Times announces the trade of Brooklyn star Zack Wheat
to the Giants for P Pol Perritt and outfielders Jack Murray and Dave
Robertson. However, it is a false alarm and the trade never takes place.

help beat the Braves, 11-6.

Meanwhile, in the AL, Indians hurler George Uhle does the same to Detroit's
Dutch Leonard in the 4th in a 12-5 win. Uhle is 3 for 5 setting a ML-record

HR. Meadows poked his first on the 16th, off Slim Sallee.

against the Yankees but the New York bats are the difference as the Yanks
win, 9-5.

Wrightstone has 3 hits, including a 9th inning grand slam for the visitors.

losing to the A's 7-3. Protests by a few members of a nearby church are the
reason for the shift from Fenway. The Braves, rained out of their scheduled
Sunday game on April 21, will play their first Sunday home game on May
5. Starter Red Ruffing gives up 4 runs in the 6th, including consecutive
homers by Miller and Dykes. When Milt Gaston takes over in the 7th he pitches

At Navin Field, Goose Goslin, Detroit OF, hits into 4 consecutive DPs,
but the Tigers beat Cleveland 4-1. In the DP department, Tiger 3B Marv Owen
makes an unassisted DP; he'll have another one tomorrow, just the 2nd time
in history a third baseman has done that in consecutive games.

1935
Trade unions direct their attention at the Cardinals, voting to boycott
their games because team captain Leo Durocher made an anti-union statement
in behalf of his wife's dress business. The ballpark is eventually picketed
to protest nonunion ushers, gate men and vendors.

At the Polo Grounds, Hal Schumacher beats the Phils, 3-0, allowing just a
controversial hit to Phils P Orville Jorgens. Jorgens hits a grounder that
Dick Bartell heaves off line and the throw eludes 1B Bill Terry. Everyone
assumed it was an error and it was not till after the game that fans realized
it was ruled a hit.

1937
In a game against the Reds in Chicago, Cubs P Larry French sustains a broken
bone in his right hand when he is hit by Ernie Lombardi's line drive during

the A's, 8-4.

1946
Two days after buying Goody Rosen and Jack Graham from the Dodgers, the
Giants sweep a doubleheader from Brooklyn 7-3 and 10-4 before 56,076. Rosen
is the hitting star with 5 hits and, when the Dodgers end the season in a
tie with the Cardinals, fans speculate that the Dodgers traded Rosen 2 days
too soon. Hal Schumacher wins the opener - his first victory since 1942 -
and Bob Joyce, a 31-game winner last year in the PCL, takes the nitecap
for his 3rd straight win. Pee Wee Reese's two-run homer off Prince Hal does
most of the Dodger damage. Jake Pike has a three-run homer in the first to
rout Joe Hatten. Despite the double loss, Brooklyn remains in first place.

The Red Sox take over the AL lead by sweeping two from the A's. Tex Hughson
wins 2-1 and Mickey Harris follows suit, 5-1. Sam Chapman's homer in the
opener ruin's Tex' shutout.

pitches and bats the Indians to a 3-1 victory over the Tigers. Embree
scatters six hits and knocks in two runs in the 12th for the win. Embree
had singled in the 11th, one of eight hits allowed by Stubby Overmire.

At Yankee Stadium, the Negro League Homestead Grays take a pair from the

allow just 7 hits in the two games in winning.

the field. Ralph Branca allows just 4 hits while the Dodgers collect 19,
including 4 by Campanella.

1950
The Yankees send OF Dick Wakefield to the White Sox for OF John Ostrowski
and cash. Wakefield, a hot hitter in 1943 who has since lost his sparkle,
refuses to report unless the Sox restore a $5,500 salary cut inflicted by
the Yankees. Wakefield says the Yankees talked him into signing for $17,500
with the "guarantee" that he'd earn $5,000 as a World Series share. New York
refuses to return Ostrowski and the Sox refuse Wakefield's request. Happy
Chandler rules in favor of the Sox and Ostrowski and Wakefield return to
their teams.

The Reds Herm Wehmeier pitches a 2-hitter, stopping the Cubs, 3-1.

1953
A wild fight occurs after Browns Clint "Scrap Iron" Courtney lines a ball off
the wall and comes into 2B spikes high on Phil Rizzuto in the 10th inning in
St. Louis. In the brawl, umpire John Stevens dislocates his collarbone. Six
players are fined for their actions. Courtney retaliated after being knocked
over in the top of the 10th when Gil McDougald scored the go-ahead run in
an eventual 7-6 Yankee win. New York took a 5-0 lead on a 3-run homer by
Mantle off Bob Cain in the 3rd, a moon shot that cleared the LF wall of the
newly renamed Busch Stadium. The Browns tie the game at 6-6 to set the stage
for the brawl that ends with a shower of bottles from angry fans. Outside
the stadium, the Yankees need a police escort to board their bus. Courtney
will be fined $250 for the fisticuffs, with five other players receiving
lesser fines. The total of $850 in fines is the most ever for a brawl.

in the first 8 innings as he matches rookie Don Lee (7 IP), 0-0. Wynn, who
homered off Lee's father, is 0 for 2 at the plate. Aber loses the nitecap,
3-2, when House makes an error in the 10th inning, juggling the ball at the
plate with Busby scoring. Aber had made the putout at 1B on a 3-1 play and
3B coach Stanky waved Busby around from 2B. Avila and Colavito homer for
the Tribe while Bolling connects for Detroit.

Five days past his 40th birthday, Warren Spahn becomes the second oldest

1978
Padres' rookie Ozzie Smith, a future Hall of Famer due to his defensive
prowess at short, makes what he will rate as his best play ever when he dives
to his left to field a grounder hit by Jeff Burroughs of Atlanta. Although

record 9 consecutive hits.

Darryl Strawberry hits a grand slam in the first inning at New York but it
takes another five hours before the Mets score again. Mookie Wilson scores
from 3B when Clint Hurdle's grounder goes through the legs of Pittsburgh
first baseman Jason Thompson for an error in the 18th inning to give the Mets
a 5-4 victory in a game that lasts 5 hours and 21 minutes. Lee Tunnell,
the Bucs 7th pitcher, takes the loss. A defensive gem by Rusty Staub,
robs the Pirates of at least one run in the top of the 18th. Staub, 41,
who weighs 230 is pressed into service when the Mets run out of players in
the 12th inning. Staub played right field when right-handed batters came
up and left field when left-handed hitters batted. He was playing right
in the top of the 18th. With Tunnell on second and two out, pinch hitter
Rick Rhoden hits a looping fly ball down the RF line and Staub makes a
running catch to save a run. In the bottom of the 18th Gary Carter draws a
walk and Wilson, running for him, goes to third on Strawberry's single to
right. When Hurdle's grounder went through Thompson, it ends the longest
game in 3 years. Through one stretch in the marathon, in which 43 players
were used, Pirate pitchers hold the Mets hitless for 10 innings.

looking for. Mike Boddicker drops to 0-5. Only the '61 Phils had a longer
losing streak, 23.

1989
Nelson Liriano breaks up a no-hitter in the 9th inning for the 2nd time
in 6 days, ending Kirk McCaskill's bid with a pinch-hit double. McCaskill

Philadelphia hurler Jason Grimsley sets a major league mark by tossing a
wild pitch in his 9th consecutive game (dating back to 1990), but Grimsley

Jaimie Cocanower of the Brewers. In the same contest, the Phillies turn
the 1st triple play in the 20-year history of Veterans Stadium. It happens
in the 1st inning after the 1st two batters walk ... Randy Ready catches
Gwynn's line drive, steps on 2B, then steps around the runner Tony Fernandez
to throw to 1B, missing a chance for an unassisted triple play. Afterwards,
Ready says, "I really didn't think about it at the time. My instincts just
said to throw the ball to first and get the easy play and that's what I did."

After recording the final out in his save of the Reds 4-3 win over the
Cubs, Cincinnati pitcher Rob Dibble takes the ball from catcher Joe Oliver
and hurls it into the center field bleachers, where it strikes Meg Porter,
a 27-year-old first-grade teacher. Dibble later apologizes for his tantrum,
saying, "I have to mature. I have to come to grips with it." The righthander
will receive a 4-game suspension for his actions.

1995

the ML leader for the decade.

The Mets defeat the Padres, 4-3, on a 9th inning HR by C Mike Piazza. It is

$27.5 million per season.

a 17-game hitting streak, has agreed to the richest contract in franchise

$85.5 million six-year no-trade deal that will keep the All-Star flychaser
in Baltimore through the 2018 season.
