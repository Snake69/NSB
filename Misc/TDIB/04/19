players. The A's take the morning game, 3-1.

1927
Calling the play-by-play in the Tigers' 8-5 victory over the Indians, Edwin

in 3 years to help the A's top the Senators, 3-1. Howard Ehmke allows 8

two homers (one a grand slam), a double and a single ... in his 5th at-bat
he's hit by a pitch.

1929
The Giants bounce the Phils, 14-5, on 20 hits. Also hitting are Philley 1B

bench. When separated, Hurst is ejected. Vet Carl Mays is the winning pitcher,

but NL Prexy John Heydler backs up Evans' interpretation on the call.

at-bats. With 2 outs in the 1st inning, newly acquired Ernie Koy smashes
a HR off Phils P Wayne LeMaster. Phils lead-off hitter Emmett Mueller then
hammers a Van Lingle Mungo offering for a HR to tie the game. Mueller is 2
for 3, while Koy, looking like a Hall of Famer, goes 3 for 5 in the Dodgers'
12-5 win. Luke Hamlin is the victor over Wayne LeMaster. Koy and Mueller

the major leagues.

in ML history.

1945
Joe Cronin of the Red Sox, catches his spikes at 2B and fractures his right

continue as manager. Mike Ryba decides the game by hitting Johnny Lindell
on the wrist with the bases full in the 9th.

1946
The Yankees open at home on Good Friday, a perceived conflict that is strongly
protested by the New York chapter of the Catholic War Veterans. Because

of throwing out the first ball. A WW II Medal of Honor winner substitutes,

in the opening inning against Nats starter Early Wynn. The second man up,
Tommy Henrich, belts a two run homer, and a few batters later Allie Reynolds
hits his first major league homer, a three run shot, that makes the score,
7-0. Wynn gives up 16 hits and all 12 runs before leaving in the 9th for Ramon
Garcia. Reynolds wins 12-4, allowing 11 hits, four by Leon Culberson. The

13th, but he will never play another game in the majors.

In the 2nd inning of the Patriot's Day doubleheader at Fenway, the Sox
slug three consecutive homers off A's pitcher Phil Marchildon. Connecting

do much more, though, and the A's win the A.M. game in 11 innings, 5-4. A's
rookie LH Lou Brissie then defeats the Red Sox 4-2 on 4 hits in the afternoon
game. Wounded in W W II, Brissie, who has a metal plate in one leg and wears
a shin guard as protection, is hit just above the guard by a Ted Williams
line drive and is downed for several minutes.

tie it at 2-2 in the 7th on Berra's 2-out pinch single. New York wins 3-2

Before a record opening-day crowd of 34,530 in Brooklyn, the Dodgers pay
tribute to Jack "Shorty" Laurice, the "number one" fan and leader of the
Ebbets Field "Sym-phony" band. Laurice died in 1948. The Dodgers then
trounce the Giants, 10-3, with 2 4-run innings. Campanella, Robinson, and

up a league high 37 homers this year, takes the loss.

Governor Adlai Stevenson and mayor Martin Kennelly are at the opener
in Chicago to see 41-year-old Rip Sewell best the Cubs again, 1-0, in a
pitching duel with 39-year-old Dutch Leonard. Leonard allows 5 singles
but Smalley's fumble in the 9th on an easy grounder lets in the winning
run. Sewell, who beat the Cubs 7 times last season, has now shut them out 3
times on Opening Day. It's the first of 6 shutouts the Cubs will lose this
year with Leonard starting.

1950

after hitting a ball off the fence in left CF off Dick Fowler. It is the
first IP grand slam at Fenway. Harry Taylor is the winner. Maury McDermott
is the winner over Morrie Martin in the nitecap, which draws 23,541. A's

the Dodgers will play here in 1956.

34-year-old outfielder doesn't disappoint the South Side fans when, in
addition to hitting a grand slam in the fourth, he leads off the bottom
of the ninth inning with a walk-off homerun giving the White Sox a 10-9

Gibson is the winner allowing 4 hits and striking out 8.

1965
At a cost of $20,000, the outer Astrodome ceiling is painted because
the sun's glare makes fielding fly balls hazardous. Outfielders had been
wearing batting helmets in preseason games because of the glare. Painting
the skylights will reduce the lighting by nearly 40% and create the need
for lights. But the lack of sunlight will cause the grass to die and spur
the introduction of artificial turf.

Doyle Alexander, to put the Orioles in the lead, 4-1. Connally fouls off 9
pitches before connecting and his next HR will also be a grand slam. Toronto
eventually wins the game, 6-5.

1986
Oakland's Jose Rijo sets a club record with 16 strikeouts in 8 innings as
the A's beat Seattle 7-2. The 2 clubs combine for 30 strikeouts overall,
setting the modern ML record for a 9-inning game.

1987
Rob Deer's 3-run homer and Dale Sveum's 2-run shot off Greg Harris caps
a 5-run rally in the bottom of the 9th inning and gives the Brewers a 6-4
win over Texas and a 12-0 record, breaking the 1981 A's record for the best
start in AL history.

Cardinals' ace John Tudor suffers a broken leg when Mets catcher Barry Lyons
crashes into the St. Louis dugout while chasing a foul pop. Tudor, who was
not pitching in the 4-2 Cardinals win, will be sidelined until August 1st.

1989
Mets' SS Kevin Elster plays his 73rd consecutive errorless game in a 4-2
win over the Phillies, breaking Ed Brinkman's ML record for shortstops.

1994
The Red Sox defeat the Athletics, 13-5, as Mo Vaughn and Tim Naehring twice
hit back-to-back HRs. The pair connect off Bob Welch in the 2nd inning and
off Carlos Reyes in the 6th.

Expo OF Larry Walker throws out Giants P John Burkett at 1B on a ground
ball into RF. Montreal goes on to defeat San Francisco, 4-3.

1996
The host Rangers show no mercy in running up the largest score in the AL
in 41 years and trouncing the league-leading Orioles, 26-7. Sixteen of the
runs come in the 56-minute 8th inning, their last at-bat, and the largest
8th inning tally in baseball history. (The Rangers fall one run short of
setting a modern major league scoring mark in one inning. In 1952, the
Red Sox tallied 17 times in the seventh inning in a 23-3 rout of Detroit
at Fenway Park.) The inning is highlighted by Kevin Elster's grand slam
off O's backup IF Manny Alexander. Manny, no Grover Cleveland, walks 4
including 3 with the bases loaded, but does manage to get an out. For O's
reliever Jesse Orosco, it's a bad 2 days as he gives up 12 earned runs in
2 1/3 innings. The 2 outings raise his season ERA from 1.52 to 3.40. Juan
Gonzalez hits two homers and has 6 RBIs, while Dean Palmer (2) and Will
Clark also add round-trippers. Darryl Hamilton has 3 at-bats in the 8th. O's
manager Johnson fumes when Mickey Tettleton takes 3B with Texas ahead 20-7:
"I've seen it all, but guys tagging up from second with an 18-run lead,
it's ridiculous." Texas manager Johnny Oates, who still carries a clipping
from a 1983 IL game when Johnson, with a 9-run lead, had his team stealing
against Oates' squad, counters, "Davey didn't have to use an infielder to
pitch in that inning."

The wind is blowing out in Chicago, and Brian McRae, with a grand slam,
Sandberg and Mark Grace hit consecutive homers in the 6th to give the
Cubs a 10-6 win over the Giants. Losing lefty Mike Watson serves up 5 Cub
homers and shows little respect for venerable Wrigley Field: "I hate this
place. They should burn it down."

The A's have a delayed home opener in the reconstructed Oakland Coliseum,
though there are no bleachers for the time being. The formerly symmetrical
stadium now sports six distinct angles in the outfield, much like the old
Forbes or Ebbets Field. All the fans tonight are given yellow construction
helmets with the A's logo on them. The A's, 2-4 in their 6 early games in
Las Vegas, lose 4-3 to the White Sox when Frank Thomas cracks a 2-run homer
in the 8th to give Chicago reliever Matt Karchner his 3rd win.

At Anaheim, California's Mark Langston picks up a complete game win,
4-3, over the Tigers. Detroit's Mark Parent and the Angels' Tim Wallach
both homer, but neither is over the left field fence where actor Charlie
Sheen has purchased 2,615 seats for himself and three friends. Sheen,
an inveterate sports memorabilia collector, was hoping for a homerun in
his vicinity. "I didn't want to crawl over the paying public," said Sheen
after shelling out $6,500 for the seats.

1997
At Shea Stadium, the Cubs lose their 13th consecutive game to match the
longest losing streak in the franchise's 122-year history. Reliever Turk
Wendell, wearing #13, is tagged with the loss when Chicago is defeated by
New York, 6-3.

1998
Equaling their largest margin of victory when keeping an opponent scoreless,
the Mets rout Cincinnati at Cinergy Field, 14-0. Outfielder Bernard Gilkey
crosses the plate in the first, third, fifth, seventh and eighth innings
becoming only one of four players in franchise history to score five runs
in one game.

The Devil Rays blank Anaheim, 6-0, improving their record to 10-6. Tampa
Bay becomes the first expansion team ever to be four games over .500 at
any point during their inaugural season.

Florida Marlins rookie 3B Kevin Millar makes his first major league start
against the Diamondbacks. On the first pitch he sees from Jeff Suppan, Millar
swings and hits a foul ball. In doing so, he breaks the hamate bone in his
left hand, sending him to the DL. Florida goes on to defeat Arizona, 4-3.

The Blue Jays beat the White Sox, 5-4, despite Lou Frazier tying the Sox
team record (George Davis and Jimmy Callahan, in 1905) for stolen bases with
4. Interestingly, Frazier is 0 for 3 at the plate. Albert Belle homers for the
Sox, and Mike Stanley and Ed Sprague go back-to-back for the Jays in the 4th.

1999
A sore back puts 'Iron Man' Cal Ripken Jr on the disabled list. It is
the first time the Oriole infielder has been on the DL during his 19-year
career. Ripken's record consecutive game streak ended last September at
2,632 games.

The Rockies blow a pair of 4-run leads before bouncing back to score 3 runs
in the last half of the 9th inning and pull out an 11-10 win over the Expos.

2000
The Astros top the Dodgers, 10-3, as LA starting P Orel Hershiser ties a
modern major league record (equaled by 19 others) by hitting four batters in
only 1 1/3 innings of work. OF Richard Hidalgo is hit by 2 of Hershiser's
pitches, and is also plunked by reliever Matt Herges, to tie another ML
mark. The 5 HPB also ties another 20th century mark by both pitchers and
batters, done by Atlanta and Cincinnati on July 2, 1969.

2001
The Yankees defeat the Blue Jays, 6-5, in 17 innings and almost 6 hours. Six
relievers pitch 11 scoreless innings before Chuck Knoblauch walks and Jeter
singles him to 2B. O'Neill's 4th hit of the game finally ends it. Both
teams total 14 pitchers, who throw 538 pitches (336 Ks) and strand 35 runners.

2002
Mariners' third baseman Jeff Cirillo ties the major league record for
consecutive errorless games at the hot corner by playing his 99th contest
without a miscue. The mark took John Wehner more than eight years to establish
playing as a journeyman infielder with the Dodgers, Pirates and Marlins. The
Rangers shut out the Mariners today, 9-0, ending Seattle's 10-game winning
streak. Cirillo's streak will end tomorrow.

2004
The Seattle Mariners became just the third team since 1974 to win a game
on a balk in extra innings edging the A's, 2-1. With runners on first and
third and two out in the bottom of the 14th inning, Oakland A's reliever
Justin Duchscherer is called for a balk to score Quentin McCracken from third
and give the Mariners a 2-1 win over the A's. Duchscherer faked a throw to
third then threw to first baseman Eric Karros in an attempt to pick off the
runner there. However, home plate umpire Paul Emmel ruled that the reliever
had stepped toward the plate rather than to first and, under rule 8.05c, had
committed a balk. Seatttle starter Freddy Garcia pitches 7 scoreless innings
but closer Eddie Guardero gives up a HR to Jermaine Dye in the 9th to tie it.

After Jeff D'Amico gives up 4 runs without recording an out, Jake Westbrook
relieves and pitches 7 hitless innings against Detroit. Two relievers
allow 3 runs apiece after Jake leaves, and the Tigers beat the Indians,
10-4. Westbrook is the first pitcher since 1969 to pitch 7 perfect innings
in relief; the previous highs were the 6.2 perfect innings pitched by Casey
Cox in 1969 and John Montague in 1977.

2005
David Wright's seventh inning grand slam at Philadelphia's Citizens Bank
Park establishes a club record for homeruns hit in a game. The Mets go deep
seven times (Reyes-2, Diaz-2, Piazza, Wright and Mientkiewicz) when they
rout the Phillies, 16-4.

2006
A bird flies into the visiting clubhouse at Camden Yards in Baltimore
about two hours before game time. As soon as it lands on the carpet, it
reportedly strolls directly over to the locker of Cleveland Indians P Paul
Byrd. The Orioles then flip the bird to the Indians, pummeling them 18-9
on 21 hits. Each team hits three homers with the Orioles getting three-run
homers from Ramon Hernandez and Jay Gibbons. Every starter for the Birds
records a multi-hit game.

The Cubs (9-5) score three unearned runs in the 8th to beat the Dodgers, 5-4,
but lose Derrek Lee who breaks two bones in his right wrist in a collision
at first base. When he returns to action on June 25, the club will be 28-45.

2009
For the third successive day, the Marlins rally from behind in the top
ninth inning to complete a sweep of the three-game series against the
Nationals. The last team to win three consecutive times after trailing in
the ninth inning was the 1998 Tigers, who came back in dramatic fashion in
a trio of mid-September contests to beat Toronto and Minnesota.

2012
Enroute to an 11-4 victory in Washington, Jose Altuve, Brian Bogusevic and
Matt Downs all collect three-baggers in Houston's five-run first frame. It
is the first time in franchise history the Astros hit three triples in
one inning.

2013
After stealing second base, Jean Segura attempts to swipe third, but when
the play ends the Brewers shortstop is standing on first as he aborts his
journey to third and mistakenly thinking he is automatically out when he
finds teammate Ryan Braun occupying second base, he heads for the dugout
before taking refuge at first upon realizing he is still safe. Two pitches
later, the bewildered Milwaukee baserunner is thrown out trying to steal
second base again to become the first player to have stolen second and then
is caught stealing the same base in the same inning.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Matt Harvey becomes the first pitcher
in modern major league history to win his first four games while giving
up less than a total of ten hits. The 24-year-old Mets right-hander easily
outduels his mound opponent, Washington's former phenom, Stephen Strasburg,
prompting the Citi Field crowd to start chanting, "Har-vee's be-tter,
"Har-vee's be-tter."
