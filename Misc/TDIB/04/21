Reds to a 7-1 over the Cardinals.

over his cousins and his 12th straight against the A's.

1922
Detroit Tiger OF John Mohardt, who mops up in the Indian loss, gets his
only ML hit, a single against Cleveland's Charlie Jamieson. Mohardt will
play just 5 games in the major leagues, but the former Notre Dame football
star will play with Red Grange and the NFL Bears in 1925.

to help himself to a 16-9 win. Whitehill will hit 2 more homers this year,
then just one more in his career. Rookie Dale Alexander, batting cleanup,
hits his 1st ML homer, off reliever Chad Kimsey. Alexander will have a
marvelous rookie year, hitting 25 homers, batting .343, and knocking in
137 runs. He will have 135 RBIs in his 2nd season ... only Joe DiMaggio
will bat in more runs in his first 2 years in the majors.

8-6. Mickey Cochrane hits a 9th inning grand slam to win it. Foxx adds a

Giants. The Phillies make 6 DPs in all to equal the NL record as the Sunday
blue laws end the game after 10 innings, 4-4.

Babe Ruth homers in the first inning off Dodgers P Ray Benge, but it is
all the scoring for the Braves as they lose, 8-1. For the Babe, it is his
710th HR.

Tied 4-4 with the Cubs in the 11th inning, the Reds pull off a triple play to
squelch a Chicago rally. Augie Galan, with 3 hits in the game, lines a shot to
right that Sunny Jim Bottomley snares to start the tri-killing. The Reds then
score 4 in the 12th to win, 8-4. Galan will finish the year without hitting
into a double play, and this will be one of just two triple plays in the NL.

1938
The Dodgers Tot Pressnell shuts out the Phillies, 9-0, in his first ML
start. It's the biggest margin for a debut shut out ever in the NL.

1939

against the A's on a Frankie Hayes passed ball. The Sox roll to a 9-2 win.

1941
33-year-old vet Wes Ferrell beats the Phillies, 8-1, in a complete game win
for the Braves. He also has an RBI single, but it is his last ML win. He'll
be released May 8, but end up managing in the minors and winning two batting
titles (the Virginia L in 1942, when his 31 HRs will lead the league and
the Western Carolina L in 1948). His lifetime minor league average will
end up at .349.

Day win.

At the home opener at Wrigley, 9,044 fans watch as the Pirates Rip Sewell
allows just three hits to beat the Cubs, 6-0. Paul Derringer is outgunned
in the loss. It is the 2nd Opener in a row that Sewell has beaten the Cubs,
and he will rip off another five wins over them this year. There are just
4 games today, but all of them end in shutouts, a record.

1944
Mike Kreevich hits a pair of HRs, as the Browns beat the White Sox 5-3. In
the preceding 3 years, a period involving 297 games, Kreevich tallied just

April 23rd.

1945
The Red Sox go to 0-5 as the A's club the Sox at Fenway, 8-2. Ford Garrison

After dropping an 11-inning duel between Rowe and Sain, 3-2, the Phillies
rebound to take the 7-inning nitecap from the Braves, 3-1. It is their

Hutchings. Hutchings set a club record last year with 57 appearances,
but this will be the last of his ML career.

Yankees, 6-3. DiMag's blast is a 450-foot shot.

Calvert, who will also drop 14 straight this year.

1950
Boston's Vern Stephens slugs a 9th-inning grand slam off the A's Harry Byrd
to lead the Red Sox to an 8-2 romp. It was the first of 33 AL grand slams
in 1950. The ML season total of 68 is a record up to this point. In 1995,
the number will exceed 100 slams for the first time.

In Boston, Sam Jethroe makes his home debut, the first black man to play
for the Braves. He goes 1 for 3 in a 2-2 tie with the Phillies. The game
is called when a thunderstorm hits.

In Cleveland, before 79,570 fans, the 4th largest paid attendance to date,
the Yankees take two from the Indians, winners of 9 out of their last 11. In
the opener, DiMaggio drives in 6 runs on 2 homers, one a grand slam, and the
Yankees roll 14-5. New York collects 19 hits in the nitecap to win easily,
12-4. Eddie Lopat and Allie Reynolds each win their 4th of the year, as
the Yankees now pace the AL by 2 1/2 games.

1951
Gil Coan of the Senators gets two triples in the 6th inning at Washington,

be a starter for the Birds over the next four seasons.

1957
Don Hoak, the Reds' baserunner on 2B, breaks up a DP by fielding a Wally
Post ground ball and flipping it to Braves SS Johnny Logan. The umpire calls
Hoak out for interference but Post is given a single on the play. The Braves
still win, 3-1. In yesterday's 5-4 loss to the Braves, baserunner Johnny
Temple let Gus Bell's ground ball hit him with the same result ... Temple out
for interfering and Bell awarded a single. The two incidents prompt league
presidents Warren Giles and Will Harridge to jointly announce a rule change
that declares both the runner and batter out if the runner intentionally
interferes with a batted ball, with no runners allowed to advance.

White Sox P Earl Wilson comes within 2 outs of pitching his 2nd no-hitter,
but his bid is spoiled by Hector's Lopez' single in the 9th. He yields 2
more singles but wins, 1-0, in 10 innings over the A's Tom Morgan. Lollar,
batting for Wilson, hits a game-winning sac fly.

At Baltimore, a power failure ends the nitecap between the Orioles and
Senators after five innings. With the Senators leading 2-1, a short circuit
prevents the lights from being turned on. It is a first in ML history. The

and homer for Boston.

first home game in Minnesota at Metropolitan Stadium losing to the 'new'
expansion Washington Senators.

1963
Playing at Little Rock, C Rico Carty of the Toronto Maple Leafs (International
League) hits two homeruns in one at-bat. With one on in the top of the second,
the catcher's first blast is nullified because it's ruled time had been
called - so 4 pitches later Carty hits a second shot over the fence. The
victimized pitcher is Ferguson Jenkins of the Little Rock Travellers,
who loses the game 5-1.

Cincinnati P Jim Owens sets a NL record as the first hurler in NL history
charged with 3 balks in one inning (the 2nd) in a 7-0 loss at Los Angeles.

first off Camilo Pascual, but the Twins come back to win 7-2.

1966
The Phillies obtain Larry Jackson and Bob Buhl from the Cubs in exchange for
future Hall of Fame hurler Ferguson Jenkins, outfielder Adolfo Phillips and
first baseman/outfielder John Herrnstein. "It's the best deal we could've
made," says Phils manager Gene Mauch. "I think it complemented our staff
exactly the way we wanted." The pair of right-handers will post a 47-53
record collectively for Philadelphia as the Chicago's new moundsman will win
twenty or more games for six consecutive seasons starting in 1967. Jenkins
was 2-1 for the Phils in 1965 after being brought up from Arkansas (PCL),
but he'll go into the Hall of Fame as a Cub.

The White Sox edge the Angels, 8-6, as Tommie Agee scores 5 runs. Agee has

scheduled game against St. Louis ends a streak of 737 consecutive contests
at Dodger Stadium without a washout.

At Fenway, rookie Bill Rohr again tops the Yanks, beating Mel Stottlemyre,
6-1. Elston Howard's 8th-inning single drives in the only Yankee score. Rohr

with the Indians next year.

1968
Behind complete-game wins by Earl Wilson and Denny McLain, the Tigers
beat the White Sox, 4-1 and 2-1, to stretch their win victory streak to 9

Concepcion, Perez and Tolan) while the Braves counter with 3 HRs of their
own (Carty, Cepeda and Millan) in a night game slugfest won by Cincinnati,
13-8. The 10 HRs, the 6 different batters for one team and 9 different
batters for two teams, all tie or set NL records.

1971
In a 10-2 Pirates win over the Braves, Willie Stargell hits 3 HRs in a game
for the 2nd time of this young season. Stargell turned the trick 11 days ago.

baseball, leaves a record-tying 9 runners on base.

1976
In Chicago, Montreal's Tim Foli hits for the cycle, but it takes him two days
to do it. Foli has a single, double and triple against the Cubs today but,
with the Expos ahead 11-3, the game is called on account of darkness. When
play resumes tomorrow, Foli will add a homer in the 8th inning.

the team with the best (13-0 in 1982) start ever.

California's Bert Blyleven lasts just 4 innings, allowing 7 runs in an
8-0 loss to Minnesota. Blyleven allows 9 hits, including homers to Hrbek

At the Metrodome, switch-hitting DH Eddie Murray knocks a homerun from both
sides of the plate in the Indians' 10-6 win over the Twins. 'Steady Eddie'

eleven times, breaking the previous record established by Yankee legend
Mickey Mantle in 1964.

1996
Dean Palmer's grand slam and 2-run homer lead Texas (13-4) to a 9-6 win

2002
Atlanta shortstop Rafael Furcal ties a major league record, which was
most previously done by White Sox outfielder Lance Johnson in 1995, by

Tulsa Driller manager Tim Ireland is ejected in a Texas League game
for arguing about organ music at Rich Winder Field in Little Rock,
Arkansas. Against the Travelers Ireland he becomes irate when organist
Rich Pharris starts playing "I've Been Working on the Railroad" while Trent
Durrington bats in the 6th. Twice, Durrington, distracted by the music, tries
to call time, but umpire Jason Markley refuses. Durrington, an Australian,
yesterday was greeted at the plate by "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport." He
asked Pharris to replace the song with "anything else." Ireland expresses his
irritation to umpire Markley who tosses him, but orders Pharris to play only
between innings. As Ireland leaves the field, Pharris plays "Happy Trails."
