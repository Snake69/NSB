8-6, in 10 innings, the AL's first extra-inning game. Nap Lajoie grounds

Thomas "Dude" Esterbrook, a star in the 1880s with the Mets, dies in a
fall from a moving train. Esterbrook is on his way to a mental hospital
in Middlebrook, NY when he squeezes through a lavatory window and falls to
the rail bed below.

1903
The Highlanders (to be renamed the Yankees) beat Washington, 6-2, in
the first game ever played at Hilltop Park, before an estimated crowd of
16,000. The fourth-place club will compile a remarkable 41-26 record at
home in their inaugural season in New York. Jack Chesbro, who lost to the
Nats on Opening Day, is today's winner.

1904
With the score 3-1 in favor of Boston over Washington, Cy Young relieves
starter George Winter with no outs in the 3rd after Winters gives up 3 hits in
the frame. Young then tosses 7 full innings of hitless ball as Boston wins,
4-1. Young has now thrown 9 straight innings without giving up a hit. For
Washington, they finish the month with an 0-10 record.

1905
Over 30,000 attend a Sunday game between the Giants and Superbas in
Brooklyn. To get around the law, fans make "contributions" for admission. The

At Shreveport (Southern League), Harold Smith makes a strikeout-HR against
Memphis, when the catcher misses the ball and it goes into the grandstand. No
ground rules limit the runner's advance.

through a long day as the Giants rack up 10 stolen bases in beating the
Beaneaters, 8-2.

1908
In the 9th inning at Boston, the Braves are tied 2-2 with the Giants. With

the stands, but is credited with only a double in the 3-2 win.

The Pirates game in Pittsburgh against the Reds is cancelled because of snow.

1913
Chicago's Al Bridwell ends a drought of 3,246 at-bats without a homer by
slugging his first ML homer, off George Suggs. He'll hit another next year
in the Federal League. Al's dry spell stretches back to 1905.

In Detroit, Cobb is in the lineup for the first time following his holdout,
but the White Sox prevail, 6-5, in 12 innings. Ty has a single and RBI.

1914
The White Sox manage just one hit - a leadoff double by Demmitt - and almost
beat the Tigers, losing 5-4, when Detroit pushes across a run in the 9th.

At St. Louis, Cleveland uses a triple steal in the 9th - Graney, Olson and
Carisch - to tie the Browns, 3-3. The game is called after 12 innings due

Despite the failure of the NY State Legislature to approve Sunday baseball,
it is announced that there will be major league baseball on Sunday at the
former Federal League Park in Harrison, New Jersey. (TSN) All three New York
teams - the Giants, Dodgers and Yankees - will participate. This arrangement
would have been in effect last Sunday but the Senators, scheduled to meet
the Yanks, had already scheduled an exhibition game. The Sunday games in
Harrison will necessitate the rescheduling of some IL games from there. The
agreement, in which the 2 leagues will pay $10,000 a year in rent for the
park, comes about because of the settlement with the Federal League.

1919
Like kissing your sister. Joe Oeschger goes 20 innings for the Phils in
a 9-9 marathon against Brooklyn's Burleigh Grimes. Both teams score three
runs in the 19th. Oeschger walks 5 and gives up 22 hits, while Grimes walks
5 and allows 15 hits. Brooklyn's Hy Meyers hits the game's only HR.

1921
At Boston, the Giants beat the Braves, 9-4 as Art Nehf tops Joe
Oeschger. George Kelly hits a grand slam for New York.

1922
Johnny Mostil, fleet-footed White Sox CF, moves over to LF for the only time
in his career, and makes two outstanding catches to save Charlie Robertson's
2-0 perfect game over Detroit at Navin Field. Robertson, a rookie, is the
3rd pitcher in the 20th century to pitch a perfect game. Play is stopped
twice after Ty Cobb and Harry Heilmann complain that Robertson is doctoring
the ball. The losing pitcher is Herman Pillette, whose son Duane will pitch
in the AL.

Cy Williams is homerless, but the Browns beat the Indians, 11-9, despite
hitting into a triple play. Urban Shocker is the winner for St. Louis,
now tied (11-5) with the Yankees for first place.

1923
Phils OF Fred "Cy" Williams starts an unprecedented slugging spree, going 2
for 4 in a 12-3 loss to the Braves. In 15 games in the Baker Bowl, he will
accumulate 65 total bases on 11 singles, 5 doubles and 11 homeruns, and
have 29 RBIs. He will lead the NL with 41 HRs, equal to Ruth's AL top total,
but his BA will drop to .293, his only sub-.300 mark during a 7-year stretch.

1924
At Chicago Pittsburgh's Rabbit Maranville lines a triple in the 14th inning
off Elmer Jacobs, then swipes home to beat Chicago, 2-1. Johnny Morrison
is the winner.

Jess Petty (5-0) wins again, beating the Phils 8-4, and the Dodgers move
into first place.

At Chicago, the White Sox unload 9 runs in the 4th inning and outslug
Cleveland, 20-10. The 2 teams combine for 32 hits with Vosmik, Holland,
Bonura, Hayes and Simmons leaving the park.

1933
On a rainy Sunday in Chicago, 22,000 fans watch the Cubs and Cardinals

ex-Cubs manager Hornsby, take the nitecap 5-3.

1934
Red Ruffing hits a HR in the 9th off Jack Russell to defeat Washington,
7-4, and put the Yankees into first place.

1936
The hits keep coming for Detroit. Tigers player/manager Mickey Cochrane is
hit on the right instep by a foul tip. Like yesterday, it is Jake Powell
doing the damage. Powell adds insult to injury by driving in the winning
run in the 9th of Washington's 8-7 victory over the Tigers. Irving Burns,
whom the Tigers acquired from the Browns to fill in at 1B, has a hit and RBI.

The A's outslug the Browns, 12-8, behind George Puccinelli's four hits. Bill
Dietrich chops down Sugar Cain for the win. Browns manager Hornsby announces
that he is swapping 1B Jack Burns to the Tigers for lefty Chief Hogsett
and cash. Burns will take over for the injured Greenberg and hit .283.

1937
Duke All-American football star Ace Parker pinch-hits a HR in his first ML
at-bat for the Athletics, connecting off Boston's Wes Ferrell in a 15-5
loss. This is the 1st time an AL player has pinch homered in his debut
at-bat. Parker will have just one more HR on his way to a .117 average this
year, but will do better on the gridiron. He will score 2 TDs for the Brooklyn
Dodgers at Pittsburgh on November 21st and will eventually be elected into
the Football Hall of Fame. He, thereby joins Hoyt Wilhelm and Earl Averill
as one of just 3 Hall of Famers to hit a HR in their first at-bat.

Carl Hubbell limits the Dodgers to 7 hits in winning, 7-2. It is the Giants
ace's 18th straight win over 2 seasons.

1938
Aided by grand slams by Gene Moore and Harl Maggert, the Bees beat the
Phillies 16-11.

Pittsburgh 3B Bill Brubaker sets a modern ML record with 4 errors in a 2-0
loss to Cincinnati.

season, Joe DiMaggio makes his first appearance for the Yankees. In the 8-4
win over Washington, he singles and crashes into Joe Gordon, knocking himself
and the second baseman out, and sending both men to the hospital. They'll
be back the next day.

1939
At Yankee Stadium, Lou Gehrig's streak and career come to an end as the
'Iron Horse' plays his final game going 0 for 4 against the Senators and
Joe Krakauskas. Gehrig is now hitting .143 for the season. The Yankees first
baseman played in 2,130 consecutive games and compiled a .340 batting average
with 490 homeruns during his 17 seasons with the Yankees. Krakauskas wins,
3-2. No one knew this would be the very last game of Gehrig's career.

1940
Tex Carleton of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who dropped to the minors in 1939 after
successfully hurling for the Cards and Cubs, tosses a no-hitter, blanking
the Reds 3-0 in a dried-out Cincinnati. Pete Coscarart's three-run homer
in the 5th off Jim Turner is all the scoring. The win is the 9th straight
for Brooklyn since Opening Day, which ties a 20th Century ML record set by
the Giants in 1918. Carleton had been released by the Minneapolis Millers
after the 1939 season, and Brooklyn signed him as a free agent. Cincinnati
ends the streak tomorrow, winning 9-2, to move two games behind the Dodgers.

The Browns Emil Bildilli gives up hits to the first 2 Yankee batters,
and that's all as St. Louis wins, 2-1. New York is 4-6.

1941
The Dodgers, down 3-0, score 4, including a run in the 9th to beat Vander
Meer and the Reds. For the Dodgers, it is their 9th straight win, but they
drop to 2nd place behind the Cards.

the Cubs, 3-2. Fernandez had eight consecutive hits coming into today's game.

A month after selling veteran P Bobo Newsom, who had slipped to 12-20 record
after three 20-win seasons, to Washington, the Tigers sell Schoolboy Rowe to
the Dodgers. The vet will win just two in Brooklyn before making a comeback
in Philadelphia.

1943
The Phils buy OF Jimmy Wasdell, who will start the next 3 years, from
the Pirates.

1944
Before 58,000 at the Polo Grounds, the Giants pummel the Dodgers 26-8 in the
opener of two. Player/manager Mel Ott reaches base 7 times, scoring 6 runs
for the 2nd time in his career, and Phil Weintraub drives in 11 runs with
a homer, triple and 2 doubles. Teammate Ernie Lombardi drives in another
7. Dodger pitchers give up an NL record-tying 17 walks, including six in a
row (ties NL mark) in the 2nd. They walk Mel Ott 5 times, the 4th time in his
career that Ott has been issued 5 passes. A ML record-tying 3 players (Ott -
6, Medwick - 5 & Weintraub - 5) score 5 runs each ... another ML mark since
1900 is set with Ott's 6 runs + 5 runs by another teammate. The Dodgers earn
a split as Hal Gregg wins the nitecap 5-4, despite walking 8 batters. The
2-game total of 25 free passes by the Giants is an NL record. Ott adds to his
lifetime NL marks by recording his 1,700th run and driving in his 1,700th run.

The White Sox beat the Browns 4-3 to hand St. Louis their first loss after
9 wins.

St. Louis pitcher Max Lanier shuts out the slumping Cubs, 5-0, in the
opener. Ed Hanycewski takes the loss. Then Rookie Ted Wilks, on his way to
a 17-4 season, beats Hank Wyse, 7-5, to give the Cards a sweep. With the
Cubs losing 9 of their first 10 games, Jimmie Wilson resigns as manager.

1945
P Dixie Howell, briefly with Cleveland in 1940, is liberated from a prison
camp in Germany.

1946
Dispelling the rumors that he had lost his fastball after nearly 4 years
in the Navy, in the game he considers his biggest thrill in baseball,
Indian hurler Bob Feller, striking out 11 batters, throws his second career
no-hitter, edging the Yankees at the Stadium, 1-0. Frankie Hayes' homerun
in the top of the ninth inning proves to be the difference. It is the first
no hitter thrown against the Yankees.

Joe Dobson shuts out the Tigers, 4-0, and the Red Sox win their 5th in a row.

In his first start since coming out of the Army, Nashville pitcher Dutch
McCall strikes out 17.

1947
In Brooklyn, the Cubs top the Dodgers, 3-1. Jackie Robinson, nursing a
sore right arm, is hitless and is 0 for 20 since April 23rd. He'll double
tomorrow in his first at-bat.

The Red Sox pick up their first win of the year in a 7-1 victory over the
Tigers. Hal Newhouser (0-3) is the loser as rookie Mel Parnell wins his
first ML game.

1948
A 5-hit game - HR, 2 doubles and 2 singles - by Stan Musial at Cincinnati is
the first of 4 such performances by him during the year as The Man sparks the
Cards to a 13-7 win. He will do it again on May 19, June 22 and September
22. Only Cobb and Keeler have done it before. Joe Garagiola adds 3 hits
including a grand slam in the 7-run 7th. Reliever Al Brazle is the winner.

In a 9-2 win over Purdue, University of Illinois pitcher Marv Rotblatt sets
a Big 10 strikeout record with 18 K's. After graduation in June, Rotblatt
will pitch in 7 games for the White Sox this season.

1949
Rocky Nelson hits an "inside-the-glove" two-out, two-run HR in short LF
to turn a 9th inning 3-1 Cubs' lead into a 4-3 Cardinals' victory. Cubs
CF Andy Pafko's tumbling catch is ruled a trap by umpire Al Barlick, and
as Pafko races in holding the ball high, the runners circle the bases. Ted
Wilks is the winner over Bob Rush. The loss leaves the Cubs in last place.

1950
The A's are pummeled by the Red Sox in a doubleheader, 19-0 and
6-5. First-game highlights are an 11-run 4th inning and a 17-hit barrage,
which includes HRs by Ted Williams (2), Vern Stephens and Bobby Doerr. Dom
DiMaggio scores 5 runs. A's pitcher Bobby Shantz ends the slaughter with
4-plus innings of relief, as Joe Dobson is the winner for Boston.

At St. Louis, the Cards' Del Rice belts a HR in the bottom of the 13th
to break up a pitching duel between the Cubs Johnny Schmitz and Harry
Brecheen. The Cards win, 1-0. Rice also has a double as Schmitz gives up
just 4 hits and retires 20 batters in a row.

1951
In a complex 3-way deal, the White Sox get OF/3B Minnie Minoso from the
Indians and OF Paul Lehner from the Athletics. Philadelphia sends P Lou
Brissie to Cleveland and gets OF Gus Zernial and Dave Philley from Chicago
and P Sam Zoldak and C Ray Murray from Cleveland. Hard-luck lefty Lou Brissie
is considered the plum in the proceedings. Rookie Minoso, who hit .339 at
San Diego (PCL) last year is leading all Indian hitters with a .461 mark.

The Giants break an 11-game losing streak with an 8-5 win over the
Dodgers. New York scores 6 runs in the first inning as Chris Van Cuyk
lasts exactly 11 pitches before Earl Mosser, making his ML debut, takes
over. After three walks, Mosser leaves for Joe Hatten, the 3rd of six
pitchers. Sal Maglie wins, with relief help from Sheldon Jones.

Jim Prendergast, formerly of the Syracuse Chiefs, sues major league baseball
for $150,000 to test the legality of the reserve clause. The 33-year-old lefty
contends the reserve clause is monopolistic and violates anti-trust laws.

1952
Before 24,767 at Ted Williams Day at Fenway Park, the Red Sox slugger plays
in his final game before going to Korea as a Marine fighter pilot. It is also
his first start since pulling a muscle on opening day. In his last at-bat,
Williams hits a game-winning two-run HR in the 7th against Detroit's Dizzy
Trout to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win.

At Yankee Stadium, Bob Cain gives up a homer to Mickey Mantle but the Browns'
lefty beats the Yanks, 9-4.

1953
The Little-Bigger League changes its name to the Babe Ruth League.

At Chicago, the Yankees beat the White Sox, 6-1, as Mantle takes Gene
Bearden deep. The ball might not have cleared the fence except for a fan's
interference, and Paul Richards protestations about it earn him a shower. Bill
Renna adds his first ML homer, a triple and single to back Whitey Ford.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants' Sal Maglie stops the Braves, 1-0, as
Bobby Thomson's 9th inning 280-foot homer off Vern Bickford is the only
score. Thomson's clout hits the screen on the LF foul pole.

1954
Willie Mays homers in the 14th inning off Cubs lefty Warren Hacker to give
Sal Maglie and the Giants a 4-2 victory.

The Cubs purchase 1B Steve Bilko from the Cardinals for $12,500, but will
let the slugger go at the end of the year. Bilko will then lead the PCL in
HRs 3 straight years before returning to the majors.

1955
One-time Cub Russ Meyer of the Dodgers continues his mastery over the Bruins,
winning his 17th consecutive game against Chicago, 7-5. Meyer has not lost
to the Cubs since July 16, 1950, a Cubs record for consecutive losses to
one pitcher. The Dodgers lead 2nd-place Milwaukee and the Phillies by 5 games.

Bob Lemon (5-0) of the Indians beats the Baltimore Orioles, 5-2. Lemon is
the first ML pitcher to ever win 5 games in April.

innings of scoreless relief.

Harvey Kuenn of the Tigers goes 5 for 5 in an 11-7 win over the Senators.

Redlegs for OF Jimmy Greengrass, C Andy Seminick and OF Glen Gorbous. Then
the Phillies buy SS Roy Smalley from the Braves.

1957
At Brooklyn, Don Zimmer caps a battle of homers by connecting in the 10th
for Brooklyn's 5th dinger of the game. The Dodgers win over the Cubs,
10-9, with all of Chicago's scores coming by way of homers. Gene Baker
homers, Walt Moryn hits a grand slam and Bob Lennon hits a 3 run homer,
off Sal Maglie. For Lennon, who hit 64 homers for Nashville in 1954, it
will be his only ML round tripper. Campanella adds a pair for the Brooks,
and Hodges and Amoros hit HRs as well.

1958
Ted Williams homers and becomes the 10th ML player to get 1,000 extra-base
hits. The A's beat Boston, 11-4, as Bob Cerv hits 2 homers and drives home 5.

The Yankees go down to their first defeat at home, losing to Detroit and
Frank Lary, 10-1. The Motor City men wallop Ford for 7 runs in 7 innings.

Johnny Antonelli wins his second, 10-1, over the Phils as the Giants belt
5 homeruns. Jim Davenport leads with 2, and Cepeda, Spencer and Bob Schmidt
chip in with one each.

1960
Pittsburgh has a 10-run 2nd inning in its 8th straight win, 12-7, at
Cincinnati.

1961
Frustrated by a poor start, Jackie Jensen jumps the Red Sox for 8 days.

Using Joey Amalfitano's bat, Willie Mays becomes the 9th player in ML
history to enjoy a 4-HR game, and his 8 RBIs pace the Giants to a 14-4 win
at Milwaukee's County Stadium. Led by Willie's 4, the Giants total a record
tying 8 homers (and 13 in 2 games) as Orlando Cepeda (2), Felipe Alou and Jose
Pagan also homer. Willie's 6th inning homer clears the LF bleachers at County
Stadium. Hank Aaron collects a pair for the Braves for all the scoring. Billy
Loes is the winning pitcher, and it marks the 4th time he has been in uniform
at a game where a player has hit 4 homers ... Loes was with the Dodgers in
'50 and '54 when Gil Hodges and the Braves Joe Adcock connected, and with
the Orioles in '59 when Rocky Colavito collected four. In today's game,
Mays is left on deck in the top of the ninth when the third out is made.

Jim Gentile, Gus Triandos and Ron Hansen hit consecutive HRs in the 7th
inning for the Orioles, as they beat Detroit 4-2 to split a twin bill. The
O's had 1 hit in the 1st 6 innings off Foytack. The Tigers win the opener,
8-2, after going scoreless in 6 innings against young Steve Barber.

Philadelphia and St. Louis tie a ML record, and set a NL mark, by using 8

1962
The Phils finally beat Warren Spahn, 6-4, after losing to the Braves'
lefty 11 games in a row.

The Braves trade Bob Buhl to the Cubs for P Jack Curtis. Buhl, coming off
his first losing season since 1954, will be a solid starter over the next
4 years for the Cubs, winning 51 games. He also establish a ML mark as a
batter going 0 for the season, going to the plate 70 times without a hit.

1966
Rick Reichardt hits a record-tieing two eighth inning homeruns in the Angels'
16-9 victory over the Red Sox at Fenway Park. The California rookie will be
sidelined later in the season with a kidney ailment, and the 23-year-old
outfielder will have to have a kidney removed. In today's game teammate
Bobby Knoop chips in with a double and HR in the same inning.

1967
San Francisco concludes its first 3-game sweep at Dodger Stadium, as Bob
Bolin beats Don Drysdale 5-1.

Orioles Steve Barber and Stu Miller combine to pitch a no-hitter but lose
2-1 to the first-place Tigers in the first game of a doubleheader. Barber
walks 10 in his 8 2/3 innings, but in the 9th two runs come in on a wild
pitch and an error by Mark Belanger, who drops the ball on a pontential DP
that would have ended the game. Miller walks none. In his first start of the
year, Barber held the Angels hitless for 8 1/3 innings. Just 2 hits today
matches the AL record for fewest safeties by 2 clubs in one game. Three
catchers are used by Baltimore, a ML record of sorts for a no-hitter.

In a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium, Mantle breaks a 1-1 tie in the 10th with
a three-run homer off California reliever Minnie Rojas to give New York a
4-1 win. California takes the 2nd game 4-2 despite Mantle cracking a pinch
double in the 9th inning. His hit gives him 2,215, one more than Joe DiMaggio.

Cesar Tovar's single is the only hit for the Twins against the Senators'
Barry Moore. Washington wins, 3-0.

has 13 strikeouts and Bobby Tolan drives in 4 runs as Cincinnati romps over
Houston, 10-0.

Against the Seattle Pilots, the Twins score 3 in the 5th to go ahead
4-0. Then with the bases loaded, they pull off a triple steal with Carew
swiping home for the 3rd time this month enroute to a 6-4 win. The Twins
will pull off two more triple steals in 1969.

1970
Billy Williams becomes the first National Leaguer to play in 1000 consecutive
games. The Cub outfielder's record streak, which started nine years ago,
will end in 1972 after the future Hall of Famer plays in 1,117 straight
contests. Today the Braves beat the Cubs, 9-2.

1971
Oakland dazzles the Indians with a color display as Dick Green, Vida Blue
and Larry Brown score the runs in a 3-1 victory.

1973
There are no games scheduled today. Except for All-Star games and labor
strikes, this won't occur again until June 29, 1998.

1977
Ron Cey cracks a 7th-inning HR in a 6-4 Dodger win over the Expos. Cey

1980
Kansas City's Larry Gura pitches a one-hitter against the Blue Jays for his
3rd shutout in 5 starts, surrendering only a 7th-inning double to Damaso
Garcia. Losing pitcher Jesse Jefferson holds the Royals hitless for 6 2/3
innings in the 3-0 loss.

place. Richard will lose his next 3 starts.

1982
Brian Fisher of Durham strikes out 20 Salem batters, including the first
9 in a row, tying 2 Carolina League records. Durham wins, 5-3.

1983
El Paso beats Beaumont 35-21 to break the Texas League's 80-year-old record
for total runs scored in a game. A 25-mph wind blowing out to right field
at El Paso's Dudley Field was a big help to hitters. The only starter on
either team without a RBI was the winners' SS Ernest Riles.

1984
In Toronto, a game is called on account of wind. Despite gusts up to 60
mph, Jays starter Jim Clancy manages to retire the first 2 Rangers before
the umps step in and call the game. Clancy was blown off the mound several
times. The two will split a twinbill tomorrow.

1985
Dale Murphy drives in his 28th and 29th runs of the season in Atlanta's 8-4
win over the Reds, tying Ron Cey's 1977 record for RBIs in the month of April.

a ML record of 36 strikeouts in 2 consecutive games.

1988
Dave Winfield ties the major league RBI record for April established by
Dodger infielder Ron Cey in 1977 and matched by Dale Murphy of the Braves
in 1985. The right fielder, who was on base at least once in every game,
drives in his 28th and 29th runs of the month in the Yankees 15-3 rout of
Texas in New York. Don Mattingly scores 5 runs for New York.

During a 6-5 loss to the Mets at Riverfront Stadium, Pete Rose is ejected
after he shoves ump Dave Pallone with his forearm during an argument. Pallone
had accidentally jabbed Rose on the cheek with his finger. The play started
when Pallone hesitated before making a safe call at 1B, ruling Esasky pulled
his foot off the bag. During the resulting argument, Howard Johnson scored
from 3B with what proved to be the winning run. After Rose is tossed, the fans
answer by tossing debris onto the field during a 14-minute delay. Pallone
left the field and the game continued with 3 umps. Rose is suspended for
twenty days and is fined $10,000.

1989
The Blue Jays trade Jesse Barfield to the Yankees for southpaw Al Leiter. The
slugging right fielder, who led the league with 40 homers in 1986, will bat
only .231 with 62 dingers in his four years with New York, and Toronto's
new left-hander will compile a 26-24 record during his seven years north
of the border.

1990
With Dale Murphy and Ernie Whitt on base, Mark Lemke grounds to second baseman
Gregg Jefferies who lobs the ball to David Cone covering first. The runner
is called safe which leads the Mets starter to having a complete meltdown,
vehemently arguing the call with umpire Charlie Williams as the two Braves'
runners cross the plate to score.

Steve Finley takes away a 3-run homer from Lance Parrish when he makes an
8th inning catch above the wall. The play preserves a tie and the Orioles
then win, 2-1, in the 12th inning over the visiting Angels.

1991
Delino DeSheilds hits a leadoff game-ending homerun in the 9th inning off
Mike Morgan to give Montreal a 1-0 victory over the Dodgers. It is just

1996
In the longest 9-inning game ever - 4 hours and 21 minutes - the Yankees
outslug the Orioles, 13-10, to disappoint 43,117 at Camden Yards. The host O's
score 9 runs off starter Andy Pettitte and take a 9-4 lead in the 2nd. New
York ties it at 9-9 in the 5th, then wins it in the 7th on Tino Martinez'
3-run shot. Jim Leyritz and Paul O'Neill also homer for New York. The
previous record for longest game was 4:18, set in a 1962 Dodgers-Giants game.

In Cincinnati, the Pirates send the Reds to their 8th straight loss, 10-7,
by scoring 9 runs in the 4th inning. Jeff King hits two homeruns in the
deluge, including a grand slam off reliever Pugh. He hit two homers in an
inning last August 8, and becomes just the 3rd person to accomplish that
feat twice along with Andre Dawson and Willie McCovey.

The host Twins score 10 runs in the 5th inning before making an out, to
whip the Royals, 15-7. The highlight is Marty Cordova's bases-loaded triple.

Buhner homers for the M's in the 9th against closer Mariano Rivera. Tino
Martinez hits his 9th HR in the 8th inning, upping his ML-record RBI total
to 34 for the month. Martinez will have 40 RBIs in his first 30 games,
the first player to do so since Campanella in 1953; Campy had 44.

Fred McGriff homers twice and Michael Tucker has 5 hits to lead the Braves to
12-3 win over the stumbling Reds. The Braves complete the first 19-win April
in ML history. The Reds, losers of their 12th in 14 contests, get 3 hits from
Deion Sanders, who raises his average to .385. Neon also swipes his 19th base.

Toronto's Roger Clemens allows 3 hits in winning his 4th, 1-0, over Kansas
City. Carlos Delgado hits a 4th inning HR for the only score.

Mark McGwire hits two tape-measure blasts as the A's outslug the Indians,
11-9, in 10 innings. McGwire's first shot, off Orel Hershiser, is the
first ever off the Jacobs Field scoreboard and dents the Budweiser sign.
A scientist determines the ball hit by the A's slugger would have traveled
a distance of 533 feet if unimpeded. His 2nd, in the 10th, is the tie-breaker.

The Giants finish their best April in 24 years (17-7) by beating on the
Pirates, 6-1, on Mark Gardner's 3-hit pitching. Jeff Kent's 3rd inning
grand slam, off Jon Lieber, gives Gardner all the support he needs.

Kerry Wood. Mark McGwire hits his 11th, off Marc Pisciotta in the 8th.

1999
During a game against the Yankees, 2,500 of Kansas City Royals fans,
frustrated with the economic disparity in baseball, throw fake dollar bills
onto the field, and turn away from the field each time the opponents take
their at-bats. The Kauffman Stadium faithful, carrying signs which clearly
blame the problem on the Bronx Bombers, walkout en masse after the fifth
inning. The Royals defeat the Yankees, 13-6.

The Braves defeat the Reds, 3-0, on John Smoltz' one-hitter. C Ed Taubensee's
5th-inning single is Cincinnati's only safety.

over Toronto. Carlos Delgado has a pair for the Jays, while Ken Griffey Jr

2nd game in a row that he has hit grand slams to tie a ML record.

2000
Diamondback southpaw Randy Johnson beats the Cubs, 6-0, becoming only the
third pitcher baseball history to win six games in April. The "Big Unit"

other pitchers to accomplish the feat.

Cardinals Mark McGwire and Jim Edmonds go deep helping St. Louis finish the
month of April with 55 homeruns tying the 1947 New York Giants for the most
National League team homers hit in a month. It also sets a new record for
the most homers hit in April. The Cardinals defeat the Phillies today, 4-3.

Getting 2-run homers from Mark Quinn and Joe Randa, Kansas City beats Seattle,
6-3. After getting rocked in his last 2 outings, Jose Rosado (2-2) goes 5
2/3 innings before a 50-minute rain delay ends his day. He gets the win,
but this is his last ML appearance as a torn shoulder cartilage, suffered
on opening day, sidelines him.

Going deep. Major league batters set a record for most homers in a month by
hitting 931 in April. The total is 140 more than the number hit last season.

2001

team will lose $800,000.

2002
Mike Piazza hits 2 HRs and drives home 6 as the Mets defeat the Diamondbacks,
10-1. Al Leiter gets the victory for NY and in doing so becomes the
first pitcher to have defeated all 30 ML teams. Both Randy Johnson of the
Diamondbacks and Kevin Brown of the Los Angeles Dodgers have beaten 29 teams,
but Johnson needs a win against his own team, the D'Backs, for 30.

The Rockies score 8 times in the bottom of the 4th inning on the way to a
10-0 whitewashing of the Pirates. The wheels come off for Buc starter David
Williams as he hits 2 batters and makes 2 balks in the 4th. Mike Hampton
goes 7 innings for the win.

of his career for Texas, becoming the 2nd-youngest player in history to

to a 12-0 rout of the Dodgers. Winner Russ Ortiz helps with a 2-run HR and
batterymate Benito Santiago chips in a 3-run HR. Going back to last year,
Bonds is now 10 for his last 14 at-bats, with 7 homers.

The Royals name bullpen coach John Mizerock as their interim manager,
replacing Tony Muser who was fired yesterday.

The Brewers name Jerry Royster as their permanent manager.

The Rockies, with permission, are storing their balls in a humidity-controlled
and temperature-controlled room, according to Rockies president Keli
McGregor. The room keeps the humidity at 40 percent, compared with 10
percent or less humidity often felt in the mile-high city. In their first 7
Aprils, the Rockies and their opponents combined to average 15.1 runs per
game. This April, the average total score at Coors was 9.8 runs - a 35.1
percent decrease. Through the first 16 games at Coors, scoring is off 4.69
runs a game - 2.15 runs a game greater than the park with the second-biggest
run decrease, San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. However, once the warm weather -
and the Yankees - hits, run production will jump.

2003

first offense, 100-game suspension for the second offense and a lifelong ban
after the third offense for the use of steroids. In addition to the harsher
three-strike rule, the commissioner also is seeking a ban on amphetamines,
and more frequent random drug tests.

With an enthusiastic RFK crowd chanting "Let's go, ground crew" the
inexperienced group puts on quite a show of ineptitude when they struggle
putting the tarp on a very soggy field during the second rain delay of the
rain-shortened 5-3 victory over the Mets. New York files a protest after the
game is called off in the bottom of the eighth claiming the field became
unplayable due to Washington's inability to cover the field during the
37-minute stoppage of play. Washington protests the game as well.

The Athletics defeat the Mariners, 6-5, in 10 innings. Oakland's Mark Kotsay
strokes 5 hits, including a game-winning single.

2008
On the first pitch he sees from Astros reliever Dave Borkowski, Micah Owings
pinch hits a two-out, two-run homerun in the sixth inning tying the game

pitcher to hit a homer since Brooks Kieschnick of the Brewers went deep
off of the Diamondbacks' Matt Mantei in 2004.

big league teams which included the Phillies, Indians, Rangers, White Sox,
Brewers, Rays, Braves and Mets.

2009

2010
With more than twenty-five percent of its membership born outside of the
United States, the Major League Baseball players' union issues a statement
condemning Arizona's new law that requires proof of identity be shown to
any state or local official who is suspicious of a person's immigration
status. Michael Weiner, the head of the MLBPA, said the organization would
consider "additional steps" if the edict is not repealed or modified.

inning against the St. Louis Cardinals. Cabrera becomes the 337th player
to reach this mark.

The Indians pay tribute to John Adams, reknown for firing up the Cleveland
crowd by banging on his bass drum in centerfield. To celebrate his 3000th

swings at the ceremonial first pitch with his drum, dribbling a foul ball
down the first base line much to the large crowd's delight.

2012
After drilling three homeruns, Ryan Braun strokes a triple in his final
at-bat in the Brewers' 8-3 victory over San Diego at PETCO Park. The
Milwaukee left fielder, whose 15 total bases drives in six runs, is the
first player to homer three times and hit a three-bagger in the same game
since Fred Lynn accomplished the feat in 1975 as a rookie with the Red Sox.

2018
Josh Hader of Milwaukee became the first pitcher in Major League history
