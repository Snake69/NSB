Chicago, 9-2. Jack Taylor surrenders the hits and loses.

1902
Cubs rookie lefthanded pitcher Jim St. Vrain, batting righthanded at the
urging of manager Selee, grounds to Pittsburgh SS Honus Wagner. But then,

Pirate infield records all the putouts with 16 made at 1B. The Cubs now
return to Chicago for a 25-game homestand.

man to hit a HR on the first ML pitch he sees, one thrown by Claude

than matched by Chuck Klein, with a single, double and homer from the 7th
spot, who leads the Phils to an 8-3 win.

1930
Bud Clancy, White Sox 1B, enters the record books without doing a thing. He
has no chances in a 9-inning 2-1 win against St. Louis. He is the first

and single in the 1st game, a 10-5 win. He hits a 4th homer in the nitecap.

1943
The Braves ship Ernie Lombardi to the Giants for catcher Hugh Poland and
infielder Connie Ryan. Lombardi, last year's top hitter, reportedly wanted a
salary increase to $15,000, $2,500 over the Braves allowed wage scale. Under
the Treasury Department's guidelines put in before the start of the 1943
season, no ballplayer could make more than the top 1942 salary paid by his
team unless special permission was obtained. The Giants, with a top limit
of $17,500 (Billy Jurges' salary) could accommodate the Schnooze's salary
demands, and the trade was made.

1944

no-hits the Brooklyn Dodgers, 2-0, before a mid-week crowd of just 1,984

Coopers quit the team two weeks ago after learning that SS Marty Marion
had received a new contract for $13,500. The brothers want $15,000 each.

The Giants' Bill Voiselle, first citizen of Ninety Six, North Carolina,
shuts out the Dodgers, 5-0. Backing him are Mel Ott and Steve Filipowitz who
belt homers in the 6th inning. Filipowitz' drive, which apparently hits the
low screen in front of the LF boxes, is first ruled a double by ump George
Magerkurth. Home plate ump Bill Stewart overrules him, calling it a homer.

in attendance will be unable to call their friends from the ballpark with
the good news because the pay phones have been removed to thwart betting
on the contests.

Today is Babe Ruth Day at all ML parks. A crowd of 58,339 at Yankee Stadium
honors the ailing slugger, A frail Babe, choking back tears, tells the "kids
of America" that, "the only real game in the world is baseball. In this game
you have to come up from youth. You've got to start way down at the bottom,
if you're going to be successful like those boys over there." pointing to the
Yankee dugout. "There's so many lovely things said about me, I'm glad I had
the opportunity to thank everybody." The program was broadcast nationwide
and piped into all the ball parks. Ruth receives a bronze plaque with his
image on it from the AL. The NL's gift is a leather book with signatures
of all the players in the league. The Yankees and Spud Chandler lose to
Sid Hudson and the Washington Senators 1-0, but move into first place as
the White Sox lose two. Hudson scores the only run after singling.

The White Sox lose the first game to the Browns, 4-2. Al Zarilla snaps a
tie with a 2-run homer in the 8th. Vern Stephens wins the nitecap, 4-3, by
belting a three-run homer in the 8th. In the opener, the Browns have runners
on 1B (Judnich) and 3B (Witte) when the Sox turn a Berardino grounder into

6th homer for the Giants.

1949
In a wild game at the Polo Grounds, pinch hitter Pete Milne's grand slam
in the bottom of the 7th caps a 5-run inning and gives the Giants an 11-8
win over the Dodgers. The Giants lost a 6-0 lead after 4 innings. Each team
uses 19 players. Milne's homer, which eludes Snider is CF, is the 4th and
last pinch slam inside-the-park this century and is unique: it is Milne's
only ML homer.

1954
In a slugfest featuring back-to-back homers 3 times, the Reds edge the
Pirates, 8-7. Ted Kluszewski bangs a pair of 2-run homers, both off cousin Max

efforts. The Sox win, 6-4.

to their 8th loss in 9 games.

inning for Chicago. Boston wins the tip-off at Fenway, 9-5.

At Washington, Dan Pfister pitches the Kansas City Athletics to a 7-3 win
over the Senators. The Nats treat Pfister's batterymate, Billy Bryan, like

.158 and .149 the past 2 seasons, and will improve to .169 this year.

1965
The Phils set a team record with 6 HRs but still lose to the Giants 14-13.

relief as the Reds beat Houston, 7-2.

1968
After almost being scratched due to a sore throat, Tom Phoebus, the Orioles'
top pitcher last year, no-hits the Red Sox, 6-0 after the 1:23 rain delay
at the start. The Orioles' starter also leads the offense going 2 for 4 at
the plate as well as scoring and driving in a run at Baltimore's Memorial
Stadium. Brooks Robinson drives in 3 runs and makes a great stab to rob Rico

1971
Braves outfielder Hank Aaron joins Babe Ruth and Willie Mays as the only
major league players to hit 600 career homeruns. His historic homer, a

County Stadium. Willie Mays hits a 10th-inning single to beat Aaron's Braves.

Curt Flood jumps the Senators after 13 games and departs for Denmark,
ending his playing career. He sends a telegram to Senators' owner Bob Short,

personal problems are mounting every day. Thanks for your confidence and
understanding." Flood batted .293 and won 7 Gold Glove Awards during his
15-year tenure in the major leagues. He will continue his antitrust suit

1972
After 11 games into the new season, the Padres fire the only manager the
team has ever known when they replace Preston Gomez with third base coach

last place in the NL West.

1973
In 50-degree weather Kansas City's 22-year-old starter Steve Busby becomes the

season. Today's no-hitter is the first in Tiger Stadium since Virgil Trucks'
in 1952. Busby is the first no-hit game pitcher not to bat.

Jackson rounded the bases while the Yankee owner stands defiantly in his box.

1982
Todd Cruz, the Mariners' number-9 hitter, hits an 11th-inning homerun for

16-2 Tigers.

1985

first ML pitch for another homer.

1996
Dodger Tom Candiotti starts against the Cubs, but departs after one inning
with a muscle pull. His start breaks a 90-year-old ML record, and is the
454th consecutive start by a righthander for LA. The Dodgers, from October
2, 1902 until April 14, 1906, a string of 453 games, started nothing but
righties. After Candiotti's exit, the Cubs win 4-3 in 10 innings when Sammy

3rd-strike call. Bonds is only the 4th major leaguer to hit 300 homers
and steal 300 bases, joining his father, his godfather Willie Mays and
Andre Dawson. Bonds Sr is the first base coach today, filling in for Jim

Detroit coach Juan Samuel for 15 games and Tigers 3B Dean Palmer for 8 games.

Former Brewer Jose Valentin hits for the cycle helping his new team, the
Chicago White Sox, defeat the Orioles, 13-4. In Milwaukee, Valentin's
home for the past eight seasons, a player is awarded a Harley-Davidson
motorcycle for hitting for the cycle. (In exactly one month, he'll miss

season by not getting a single.) Today Valentin singles in the 1st inning,
doubles in the 2nd, triples in the 3rd and homers in the 7th.

2002
Derek Lowe becomes the first pitcher to throw a no-hit game at Boston's
Fenway Park since Dave Morehead accomplished the feat against the Indians
in September of 1965. Facing 28 batters, Lowe throws only 97 pitches in the
10-0 rout of the Devil Rays. It is the first career complete game for Lowe,
who began last season as the Red Sox closer. In his first start this year,
he hurled 7 hitless innings against the Orioles.

starting pitcher for the second game in a row. Pedro Astacio surrenders a
single to Geoff Jenkins with 1 out in the 7th to break up his no-hit bid.

The Mariners score a run in the bottom of the 8th inning to defeat the
Yankees, 1-0, despite being 1-hit by NY's Ted Lilly. Desi Relaford's single
with 1 out in the 8th inning scores the only run of the game.

The Royals fire manager Buddy Bell and hire former coach Clint Hurdle to
take his place.

2003
Needing only 108 pitches, Kevin Millwood becomes the ninth pitcher in
Phillies' history to throw a no-hitter as he keeps the NL-West-leading
Giants hitless. The last no-no before Millwood's 1-0 masterpiece was thrown
by Tommy Greene in 1991. Today is the 1st no-hitter of the season, and only
the 2nd in the 33-year history of Veterans Stadium. Millwood strikes out
10 while walking three. Ricky Ledee has 2 of the Phils' 4 hits, including
a solo homer off Foppert to account for the only score.

Ozzy, the male osprey of a breeding pair that lived for years on a Jackie
Robinson Ballpark's left field light pole, dies at the Audubon Birds of Prey
Center as a result being hit by a baseball being thrown trying to knock it
off its perch he shared with his mate Harriet and a brood of chicks. Class A
Daytona Cubs hurler Jae Kuk Ryu was charged with a second-degree misdemeanor
by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for harming a
protected bird.

The Diamondbacks sweep a doubleheader from the Mets, winning the 1st game by
a score of 6-1 and the 2nd, 7-3. New York commits 8 errors in the twinbill
and strikes out 27 times to set a new ML mark for futility. Arizona rookie
P Brandon Webb hurls 7 shutout innings, allowing just 3 hits and striking
out 10 in his 1st ML start. Webb is sent down to the minors after the
game in order to allow Randy Johnson to come off the DL and pitch the 2nd
contest. He strikes out 12.

The Rangers defeat the Yankees, 10-7, as Alex Rodriguez goes 5 for 5
and drives in 6 runs. Rodriguez has a pair of doubles in his 3rd career
5-hit game.

2004
At Dodger Stadium, Mike Piazza ties Carlton Fisk for the most career homers
by a catcher as he hits Hideo Nomo's sixth inning pitch into the stands
for his 351st round tripper as a backstop. The homer, which was his 362nd
overall, moves the Mets' star past Yankees' Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio on
the all-time list.

At Milwaukee's Miller Park, Chad Moeller becomes the first Brewer to hit
for the cycle at home. In the 9-8 victory over the Reds against starter
Cory Lidle, the back up catcher homers in the second inning, doubles in the
fourth, triples in the fifth and then singles in the seventh off reliever
Ryan Wagner to complete the feat in front of 8,918 enthusiastic fans. Moeller
adds 4 RBIs as he breaks out of a 3 for 24 slump in grand fashion.

A day after being shut out by Randy Johnson, the Cubs fail to score
against Brandon Webb, who throws 7 innings. The Diamondbacks beat the
Cubs, 10-1. Danny Bautista extends his hitting streak to 19 games for the
D'Backs. Steve Finley hits a homer and steals his 300th base.

2005
At Busch Stadium, St. Louis second baseman Mark Grudzielanek becomes the

by John Mabry. The Cardinals defeat the Brewers today, 6-3.

The Pirates edge the Astros, 2-0, behind Kip Wells. Jose Mesa sets Houston
down in order in the 9th for his 300th career save. He becomes the 19th
pitcher in ML history to reach the mark.

2006
The Indians pound the Red Sox, 15-3. Ben Broussard hits a pair of homers
and drives in 8 runs for Cleveland.

Tampa Bay's top prospect Delmon Young is suspended indefinitely by the
International League, a day after throwing a bat that hit a replacement
umpire in the chest.

2007
On the night in which the ceremonial first pitch is thrown by his three sons,
Trevor Hoffman is unable to hold on to a two run lead when the Dodgers score
three in the ninth and eventally beat the Padres, 6-5. It's 'Trevor Time
Desk Clock' Night, and the usually reliable Padres closer blows the save,
thanks to some shady defense, for the second consecutive game.

2008
At Progressive Field, the longest current consecutive games streak in
the big leagues comes to an end at 382 as Grady Sizemore does not appear
in Cleveland's 1-0 loss to the Yankees due to a sprained right ankle he
sustained yesterday. The center fielder's streak is the longest by an
Indians player since Toby Harrah played in 473 straight contests in 1979-83.

In a move which cost the team over $11 million, the Pirates release Matt
Morris after the pitcher lasts only 1 2/3 innings against the Phillies in
his previous start. The 33-year-old right-hander had compiled an 0-4 record
with a 9.67 ERA in his five outings with Pittsburgh this season.

Beating the Padres, 2-1, the Diamondbacks break the franchise mark for
wins in April having already won 17 games this month. Brandon Webb, who
outduels Jake Peavy, becomes just the third hurler in major league history,
joining teammate Randy Johnson (2000, 2002) and Dave Stewart (A's - 1988),
to post six victories before the start of May.

Giving up eight runs in three innings in the 10-1 loss to the Reds, Barry
Zito, along with Mike Maroth (Tigers - 2003) and Dave Stewart (Rangers -
1984), becomes only the third pitcher in baseball history to lose six games
in April. The battered $126 million Giants hurler, who hasn't missed a
start in his eight-year career, will be demoted to the San Francisco bullpen.

2009
West Virginia State's Bo Darby hit homeruns in five consecutive at-bats over
two games, including four in one game. The sophomore outfielder homered
in his first four trips to the plate against Salem International. He also
connected in his final at-bat two days earlier against the University of
Charleston. Darby homered twice more in the second game of the double-header,
giving him six for the day with 14 RBIs.

Colorado's Dexter Fowler tied a modern-day rookie mark with five stolen
bases in the Rockies' 12-7 win over San Diego. Fowler gave the Padres fits
all night, becoming the first rookie to steal that many bases since Damian
Jackson on June 28, 1999. That contest also involved Colorado and San Diego.

2010
With the help of a five-run ninth inning fueled by Ryan Doumit's grand slam
and Ronny Cedeno's solo shot off Trevor Hoffman, the Pirates snap a 22-game
losing streak in Milwaukee with a 7-3 comeback victory over the Brewers
at Miller Park. The Brew Crew's hometown hex over the Bucs was the longest
held by one team over another since the Browns/Orioles lost 27 consecutive
contests to the Indians in Cleveland from 1952-54.

The suddenly streaking Mets win the sixth consecutive game with a doubleheader
sweep of the Dodgers, 4-0 and 10-5. The victories mark the first time
since August 28, 1971 that the club has taken both ends of a twin bill from
L.A. David Wright, with an RBI single to right field off Ramon Troncoso in
the second game at Citi Field, becomes the eighth and quickest player to
accumulate 1,000 hits in a Mets uniform. The 27-year-old third baseman,
who surpasses Mike Piazza's mark of 935 games to reach the milestone,
accomplishes the feat in his 868th career contest with the club.

David Wright becomes the youngest in Mets history to record his 1000th
hit. He reached that mark with a single in the 5th inning against the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the second game of a doubleheader.

2013
Matt Moore (5-0) becomes the first pitcher in franchise history to win
five games in April when the Rays beat Chicago at U.S. Cellular Field,
10-4. The 23-year-old southpaw starter hurls six strong innings allowing
just a run and three hits while striking out nine Pale Hose batters.

2014
Jose Abreu extends the rookie record, a mark he previously shared with
Albert Pujols, for the most runs batted in during the month of April. The
27-year-old White Sox DH ends the day with 31 RBIs after hitting a two-run
homer and a two-run single in the team's 9-2 victory over Tampa Bay at
U.S. Cellular Field.

2019
With his 14th homerun of the season, against the New York Mets, Christian
Yelich tied a Major League record for the most homeruns in a single season
before May 1. He tied the record that was set by Albert Pujols (2006)
and Alex Rodriguez (2007).

Juan Soto, Victor Robles and Carter Kieboom became the first trio of teammates
aged 21-or-younger in Major League history to hit a homerun in the same game,
against the San Diego Padres.
