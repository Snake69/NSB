Association squad after the Brewers took three straight from the Cincinnati
Reds.

1903
Since yesterday was Sunday, today is both Opening Day and Patriot's Day
in Boston, resulting in an unusual Opening Day doubleheader. The Boston
Americans play an a.m. game before 8,376 fans beating the A's Rube Waddell,
9-4. The Athletics take the afternoon contest, 10-7, watched by 27,658,
behind Eddie Plank and rookie Chief Bender. Cy Young and Long Tom Hughes
pitch for Boston. Duke Farrell, 16-year veteran, is given a diamond ring
by his Boston teammates in the 2nd inning of the opener. He collects 3 hits
for the afternoon.

1905
Due to the late Easter this year, games are played on Good Friday for the
first time. At Philadelphia, the Phils top the Giants, 8-1.

1906
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants win their home opener, 8-2, over the Brooklyn
Superbas. Red Ames is the winner for the defending world champions.

Altrock is the winning pitcher.

1908
"The Father of Baseball," Henry Chadwick, the leading reporter, commentator,
scorer and indefatigable promoter of the game, dies in Brooklyn at age 85.

Bugs Raymond throws a one-hitter for the Cardinals, but loses to the
Cubs, 2-0. Harry Steinfeldt has the only Chicago hit in the 2-run 6th
inning. Lundgren is the winner.

At Chicago, the White Sox knock the Browns' Rube Waddell out of the box with
a 5-run 6th and a 2-run 7th to win, 7-1. They would have plated more in the
inning but Al Shaw's single results in a double play at the plate as two
runners are tagged out on the same play, RF Danny Hoffman to C Tubby Spencer.

1909
The National Commission learns that an effort to bribe umpires Klem
and Johnstone was made before the Giants-Cubs playoff game in 1908. The
identity of the alleged briber is not disclosed, but all clubs are notified
of the results of the investigation. Klem reveals that the alleged briber
was Dr. Joseph Creamer, a well-known New York physician, who served at
many cycling and boxing events. Creamer, who served as the Giants' team
physician last season, denies the charges but he will be barred for life
from all major league ball parks.

1910
Indians hurler Addie Joss throws his second career no-hitter beating the White
Sox, 1-0. Joss' 10 assists help prevent any infield spoilers. Terry Turner's
6th inning double off Doc White scores the Naps only run. Two seasons ago,
opposing future Hall of Fame pitcher Ed Walsh, the right-hander tossed a
perfect game, also against the Pale Hose.

At the Polo Grounds, Hooks Wiltse tosses a 3-hit shutout over the Doves in
the Giants' home opener. New York tops Boston, 4-0.

1912
After two days of rain, the first major league game is finally played at
Fenway Park before 27,000. The inaugural game is memorable with the Red Sox
staging an eleven-inning walk-off victory over the New York Highlanders
(Yankees), 7-6. Spitballer Bucky O'Brien and Sea Lion Hall top Jumbo Jim
Vaughn, handing the Yankees their 6th straight loss.

In Detroit, the Tigers play their first game in Navin Field, later to be
known as Tiger Stadium, defeating Cleveland, 6-5, in 11 innings before
24,384. George Mullin wins his own game with a RBI single. Detroit opens
with two double steals in the 1st inning, including Cobb's swipe of home
when Crawford takes 2B. Cobb has two singles and two steals today. The
ballpark at the corner of Trumbull and Michigan, which will serve as the
team's home for the next 87 years, replaces Bennett Park which was located
on the same site since 1896.

After hitting the game-winning HR in the 11th inning to beat the Reds, 5-4,
Cubs OF Jimmy Sheckard forgets and heads for the clubhouse after touching
2B. Teammates yell to him to complete the circuit, which he does. The manager
of the Reds is Hank O'Day, who was the umpire that day in 1908 when Fred
Merkle failed to touch 2B.

In New York, Jeff Tesreau takes over for Marquard in the 9th inning, with
the Giants leading 2-1. An error lets in 2 Brooklyn runners, but New York
scores 2 in the bottom of the 9th for a 4-3 win. Since Marquard faced 3
batters in the 9th, the victory is awarded to Tesreau.

In St. Louis, the Browns George Baumgardner and White Sox hurler James
Scott battle to a 15-inning scoreless tie.

1913
In the Tigers 6-5 win against host Cleveland, Ty Cobb steals home in the
first inning. Gregg is on the mound.

1914
The 25-player limit is suspended in the AL and NL. With uncertainty over
who has signed with what teams, it is almost impossible to know how many
players may be on the roster at any one time.

1916
In Chicago, the Cubs play their first game at Weeghman Park beating the
Reds in 11 innings, 7-6, via a Vic Saier sac fly. The stadium, minus the
upper deck added later, seats 14,000, but 20,000 fans are on hand. Greeting
fans on the Addison Street side is JOA, a bear cub owned by Cub's (partial)
owner J. Ogden Armour. The ballpark will be renamed Wrigley Field in 1926.

Washington 3B Eddie Foster hits his only homer of the year, and the last
he will hit. He ends his career in 1923 with 6 homers in 3,278 at-bats.

Boston's Babe Ruth is 0 for 4 at the plate but whips the A's, 7-1, on
five hits.

1918
On a cold afternoon, the Red Sox best the Yankees' Slim Love, 4-3, and run
their record to 6-0, the first Sox team to start the season so well. They'll
lose on the 22nd.

1920
Phils' player-manager Gavvy Cravath inserts himself as a pinch hitter and hits
a 3-run HR to beat the Giants, 3-0. For Cravath, the top HR hitter of the past
decade, it is his last four bagger. Eppa Rixey is the winner over Rube Benton.

In a preview of their May 1 marathon, Brooklyn's Leon Cadore and the Braves'
Joe Oeschger battle for 11 innings before Brooklyn rookie Walter Hood lines
an RBI double to win it, 1-0. Hood took over in CF in the 6th inning after
Hy Myers was tossed for fighting with Oscar Dugey.

At Cleveland the Indians win a marathon from Detroit, 11-10, as 10 pitchers
combine to issue 18 walks and a hit batsman. Caldwell is the winner for
the Tribe in a game that takes 3 hours and 4 minutes.

1922
The Cubs collect just 3 hits but still beat the Reds Pete Donahue, 3-1

1923
The Cubs win 12-11 over the Pirates on Gabby Hartnett's 9th-inning HR,
his 2nd of the game. There are 8 HRs in the game, 6 by the Cubs, who had
hit 4 the day before. The Cubs will hit 90 for the year, more than double
their team total of 42 last year.

1924
In Washington, Walter Johnson picks up an easy 12-3 win over the Yankees. Babe
Ruth scores 2 of the New York runs on a triple and an 8th inning homerun.

1925
Cleveland goes to 5-0 with a 15 inning 5-4 win over the Tigers. Detroit P
Syl Johnson walks in the winning run.

1926
The Yankees batter Washington 18-5. Among their 22 hits are a HR, 2 doubles
and 2 singles by Babe Ruth who scores 5 runs and drives in 8. The Babe's
homerun is a 2-run shot in the first inning off Walter Johnson. Rookie
Bill Morrell debuts in relief for the Senators and this is noteworthy only
because contemporary accounts list his age at 26, and his birth year as
1900. In fact, Morrell was born in 1893, making him off by seven years,
a possible ML record. Later encyclopedias will carry his correct birth
date. (as noted by Dick Thompson)

1927
The Indians spoil the White Sox debut at the newly-expanded Comiskey Park
edging the Pale Hose, 5-4. The new upper deck in the outfield allows 23,200
additional fans to enjoy the game.

1928
Detroit rookie Paul Easterling hits his 3rd HR in 3 days, all against the
Browns, as the Tigers take their 3rd in a row, 3-0. The Browns collect just
4 singles off Earl Whitehill. For Easterling, this is the last HR he hits
for the year.

1930

all-star team based on his 42 years of observing baseball:  Babe Ruth,
RF; Tris Speaker, CF; Ty Cobb, LF; Cap Anson, 1B; Eddie Collins, 2B; Honus
Wagner, SS; Pie Traynor, 3B; Ray Schalk, C; Cy Young, P; Walter Johnson, P.

1932
The Yankees draw the largest paid attendance, 55,452, for any home
opener. [Their "announced" attendance, however, when the stadium opened
in 1923 was 74,217.] Babe Ruth homers, as Lefty Gomez beats Lefty Grove,
and the Yankees defeat the Athletics, 8-3.

The Cubs open at Wrigley Field and manage just 4 hits off Reds' ace Red
Lucas. Cincy wins 7-2. Lucas is in the middle of a remarkable streak of
innings pitched without being relieved, a streak which began last August
13th and won't end until July 15th when Red completes 250 innings.

1933
In a 5-4 loss, White Sox LF Al Simmons makes an unassisted double play

Roy Henshaw to give the Bucs a dramatic win over the Cubs, 9-8. Bill Swift
picks up the win.

At Brooklyn, Dodger castoff Wayne "three fingered" Osborne hands Freddie
Fitzsimmons a 4-1 lead, but the Bees come back to tie 6-6 in the 12th in
a game called on account of darkness. Bees reliever Ben Cantrell induces
a 1-2-3 DP to end the 12th. Joe Stripp ends his holdout and signs with the
Dodgers today.

1937
OF Gee Walker of the Tigers becomes the only player to hit for the cycle on
Opening Day when he performs the feat against the Cleveland Indians, hitting
in reverse order for a homer, triple, double and single. Detroit wins, 4-3.

The Senators open the season before 45,850 at Yankee Stadium with a 3-2 win
over Lefty Gomez. The Yankees tally 10 hits off Monte Weaver, including
two doubles and a single by Lou Gehrig. Gehrig is playing in his 1,809th
straight game. Al Simmons, purchased two weeks earlier from Detroit, cracks
a disputed homer in the 6th to tie the game at 2-2. New York argues that
a fan reached over the railing and touched the ball. The Nats score the
winning run in the 8th on a long sac fly by Shanty Hogan.

The Browns batter the White Sox 15-10 before 7,500 fans, the Brownies largest
opening day crowd since pre-Depression days. Manager Rogers Hornsby singles
twice and drills a CF homer off Vern Kennedy.

At Cincinnati, the Cards Dizzy Dean gives up 13 hits, walks 2, makes a
fielding error, and still wins 2-0 in 10 innings. Doubles by Johnny Mize
and Joe Medwick and a single by Durocher hand the loss to Peaches Davis. The
Reds strand 14 in the shutout.

At Ebbets Field, the Giants lose 4-3 to the rival Dodgers. Dick Bartell,
who scrapped with Mungo last year, takes the first Mungo pitch for a
strike. When Rowdy Richard turns to protest the call with umpire Reardon,
he is hit in the face with an overripe tomato. Mungo wins over Hal Schumacher.

1938
Bob Feller pitches the first of 12 career one-hitters, beating the Browns
9-0. The only hit is catcher Billy Sullivan's 6th inning bunt single. After
the game, Sullivan apologizes to Feller.

1939
For the first time in club history, the A's wear numbers on their
uniforms. Connie Mack, the owner and manager of the team, believed the sale of
scorecards would suffer because players could be identified by their jerseys.

A minor league attendance record is set at Jersey City as 45,112 see the
Giants farm team play Newark (International League).

The Red Sox show off their 20-year-old prize rookie Ted Williams before
30,278 in the opener in New York, delayed two days because of rain. After
last season's American Association Triple Crown winner strikes out twice,
Williams collects a double off Red Ruffing, who wins 2-0. Gehrig makes
an error, goes hitless, and lines into two double plays in the only game
featuring the two great sluggers. Other notables in what will become a
historic boxscore include Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Jimmie Foxx, Joe
Cronin, Bobby Doerr, Red Rolfe and losing pitcher Lefty Grove. The Yanks
score their first run on a homer by Dickey and their 2nd tally on an error
by Jimmy Foxx. Boston has baserunners in each inning, but Ruffing tosses
just the 2nd opening day shutout in Yankee history. Four umpires work the
game including 3B ump George Pipgras, the starting pitcher for the Yankees
in the 1929 Opener ... his opponent for the Red Sox that day was Red Ruffing.

1941
At Shibe Park, the Yankees bombard the A's, 19-5, with Joe DiMaggio driving
in 6 runs, 4 on a grand slam. Red Ruffing is down, 4-2, to Chubby Dean
after 4 innings, but the New Yorkers notch 8 runs in the 5th. Joe Gordon
has 2 homeruns good for 5 RBIs.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants draw 56,314 ... to date the biggest crowd
ever to view a single game. They get their money's worth as the Dodgers
shade the Giants, 10-9. Mel Ott has 2 of the 5 homers hit in the game. The
Dodgers score the winning run in the 9th when Dolph Camilli scores from 2B
after Babe Young's throw hits Kampouris, running from 1B, in the head. Reiser
has 4 hits for Brooklyn and Hugh Casey wins in relief.

At the direction of Larry MacPhail, the Dodgers start to wear liners
designed by Dr. Walter Dandy in their caps. This is in response to the
numerous beanball wars of 1940 that hospitalized Joe Medwick, Billy Jurges
and others, and the cap will "save" Pete Reiser when he is beaned by the
Phil's Ike Pearson. In August, Dr. Dandy will apply for a patent on the
cap but will be turned down because the Patent Office has already granted
one to MacPhail. An accommodation will be reached between the two granting
Dandy the patent with royalties going to the Majors. The Dandy cap will
get only occasional use until 1949, when it is discarded.

A syndicate of 12 Bostonians buys 73 percent of the Braves, formerly the
Bees, for $350,000 from the Charles F. Adams estate.

1942
Against the Braves, Brooklyn's Dolf Camilli homers off Tom Earley to help
the Dodgers to a 9-2 win.

1943
The season starts, 2 weeks later than customary. Stalwarts such as Joe
DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Enos Slaughter and Johnny Mize are gone, among
some 60 players who could have been classified as regulars in the 1942
season. In the "presidential opener" in Washington, the Senators under new
manager Ossie Bluege defeat the A's, 7-5.

Braves manager Casey Stengel is struck by a taxi, fracturing a leg, and will
miss much of the season. Dave Egan, a Boston sportswriter, nominates the
cabdriver as Sportsman of the Year, weary of Stengel's humor in the face of
the Braves' pitiful record. Whitey Wietelman had a different version of the
events (as related by Stan Fischler):  "I was sitting in a bar with Casey,
having a couple of beers. He had to go across the street to the Miles Standish
Hotel. He wore a big black coat and a black hat. He walked into the cab -
and that's what happened." Tomorrow's 3rd game in the Boston City Series
will be called on account of mud. But the Red Sox will win the final match,
1-0, behind Tex Hughson.

1944
During a World War mission, 26-year-old Elmer Gedeon is killed when his
plane is shot down over France becoming the first of two major leaguers to
die in World War II. The B-26 bomber pilot played five major league games
as an outfielder for the Senators at the end of 1939 season. Gedeon is the
son of former major leaguer Joe Gedeon.

At Cincinnati, the Reds edge the Cubs, 2-1, behind Tommy de la Cruz. The
loser is Bill Fleming. The major league career of Mike Kosman ends after
a 30-yard dash. Sent in to pinch-run for Steve Mesner at 3rd base for the
Reds, Kosman is thrown out at the plate and never appears in another boxscore.

After a pair of 2-1 victories, the Giants use heavy artillery to subdue the
Braves, 10-8. Ott, Lombardi and Medwick homer and Ducky adds 2 singles and
a double. The Braves make it close knocking out starter Melton and beating
up reliever Lou Polli, making his first ML appearance since 1932. Feldman
retires the side in the 9th after 3 runs had scored in both the 8th and 9th.

late FDR before Speaker Sam Rayburn tosses out the first ball. The Yankees

camp. He was captured in North Africa in February 1943 during Operation Torch.

1946
The Cubs are shut out by Cardinal southpaw Harry Brecheen in their home
opener at Wrigley Field, 2-0. The game is the first in the club's history be
televised with 'Whispering' Joe Wilson doing the play-by-play on Chicago's
WBKB.

The Reds Bucky Walters, in a tight pitching duel with the Pirates Rip
Sewell, steals home in the 6th, but Sewell wins the squeaker 2-1 before
28,000 in Pittsburgh.

As a capacity crowd of 40,887 cheer at Wrigley Field, the Cubs raise the 1945
pennant, then lose their first game after 3 victories. Harry Brecheen of the
Cards scatters 6 hits to win 2-0. It's Chicago's biggest opener since 1929.

1947
At St. Louis, Bill Nicholson clubs 2 homers, including a slam, and drives in
6 runs to lead the Cubs, 7-4, over the Cards. Swish's first RBI comes in the
first inning when he's hit by a Howie Pollet pitch with the bases loaded. His
slam in the 5th finishes Pollet's pitching. Johnny Schmitz is the winner.

Pitching for Portland (PCL), former Tiger ace Tommy Bridges pitches a
no-hitter against SF, winning 2-0.

1948
In the Opener at Comiskey Park, George Vico of the Tigers hits the first
pitch thrown to him in the majors for a HR, a first in the AL (fifth time
in the ML). Chicago's Joe Haynes is the pitcher. (It is the first of only 12
career homeruns he'll hit in his brief two-year career.) Mike Tresh answers
for the Sox with his 2nd career homer, off Hal Newhouser; Tresh's first career
homer came back on May 19, 1940, off Dutch Leonard. The Tigers win, 5-2.

hitter, over the Yankees.

walking his 1st time up, but the Braves win the game, 6-5.

1951
The A's win their first game at Fenway since September 12, 1948, beating the
Sox, 6-3. Making it sweeter is besting Mel Parnell, winner of 10 straight
over Philadelphia. The A's break a 3-3 tie in the 8th with 3 runs to make
Alex Kellner the winner, just the 3rd lefty since 1948 to go the distance
in Fenway.

1952
Ted Kluszewski leads the Reds as Cincy turns back the Pirates, 8-6 and
12-2. Klu has a two-run homer in the opener, off Murry Dickson, and then

Adcock belts a pair of homers to back Harry Perkowski's complete game. The
Reds are now a game in back of Brooklyn.

Sal Maglie allows two hits and the Giants top the Dodgers, 6-0. The shutout

shutout anywhere was on June 26, 1951 when Maglie beat them at the Polo
Grounds. Davey Williams and Hank Thompson belt homers for New York.
