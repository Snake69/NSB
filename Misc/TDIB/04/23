1902
In his major league debut, Luis Castro plays second base for Connie Mack's
Philadelphia's A's in an 8-1 victory over the Orioles at Oriole Park. The
25-year-old Medellin native is the first and last player from Columbia to
appear in the big leagues until Orlando Ramirez breaks in with the Angels
in 1974.

St. Louis Cardinals owner Frank DeHaas Robison offers to put up $10,000 that
the Pirates will not repeat as NL champions. Pittsburgh players accept the
challenge with a matching pool, and go on to win the pennant by 27 1/2 games.

The White Stockings open the season at home by marching in from the outfield
accompanied by Thompson's American Band. After unfurling the AL pennant,
the Chicagoans then stop the Detroit Blues, 12-2, behind Nixey Callahan.

Let the injunction wars begin:  The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia
issues a restraining order returnable May 3 against the National Baseball
League stopping that organization from interfering with the 4 Washington
AL ball players. In Chicago, Charles Comiskey comes to the defense of Eddie
McFarland saying the White Stockings just won't play him in Pennsylvania. In
St. Louis, lawyers for the NL Cardinals initiate proceedings in the circuit
court of St. Louis to restrain Harper, Wallace, and Heidrick from playing
with the St. Louis American League team. All three have signed contracts
with the Cards. In Philadelphia, President Shibe of the AL Athletics says,
according to his lawyers, the Supreme Court ruling applies only to Lajoie
and has no reference to any other player.

In front of nearly 13,000 at Baltimore, the Athletics beats the Orioles
and Joe McGinnity, 5-1. In the 8th inning, when Connie Mack hears about
the injunction affecting Nap Lajoie, he pulls him from the game.

1903
Behind the pitching of Harry Howell, the New York Highlanders (1-1) win
their first game, 7-2, over Washington.

Butte (Pacific Coast League) makes 2 triple plays in one game against
Los Angeles.

1909
In the 6th inning of the Reds-Pirates game in Pittsburgh, Honus Wagner steps
across the plate to the other batter's box as Reds P Harry Gaspar delivers
the ball. Umpire Bill Klem refuses to call him out. The Pirates win 2-1,
but Reds manager Clark Griffith protests and acting NL president Heydler
backs Klem. But the league will override Heydler and Klem and order the
game replayed September 20th. The Pirates will win again, by a score of 4-3.

1910
At Boston, CF Tris Speaker pulls off his 2nd unassisted DP in 2 years, the
gem occurring in the 2nd inning against the Athletics. Speaker snares a low
line drive and beats baserunner Harry Davis back to 2B. The game goes 11
innings with the A's prevailing 5-3. Eddie Plank is the starter and winner
over Eddie Cicotte.

1913
Christy Mathewson sets down the Phils 3-1, throwing just 67 pitches. He
retires the side in the 6th on 6 pitches, and uses just 5 in the 9th
inning. Ad Brennan takes the loss. Matty will use 70 pitches in a game on
June 24th (as noted by R.J. Lesch, TSN) and, forgetting about today's game,
states that this "would have broken the record of 68, said to be held by
old Ben Sanders, but for getting in the hold (sic) in the 8th." The source
of the Sanders claim seems to be the pitcher himself, who asserted it in a
letter to the Philadelphia Inquirer, dated August 21, 1911 (and reprinted
in the Spalding Guide). The old pitcher wrote in response to a Mathewson
game of August 16, "... it may be 1890 or 1892, but my recollection is
that it was 1891, while playing with the Athletics in a game against the
Browns in St. Louis, where I only pitched 68 balls during a full nine-inning
contest." [Researcher Cliff Blau tracked down the game, played on August 5,
1891, and Old Ben's recollections turned out to be not correct. He threw
91 pitches in the game, which lasted 11 innings.]

1916
The Giants are saved from a humiliating exhibition loss to the Long Branch
Cubans at West Side Park, Jersey City, when rain halts the game in the
first inning with the Cubans leading, 8-1.

1918
Yankee lefty Herb Thormahlen loses his no-hitter when Boston's Amos Strunk
singles with one out in the 9th. A single by PH Ruth and a walk load the
bases and a short fly to Ping Bodie is dropped, allowing Strunk to score
the winner, 1-0.

At Cleveland, the Indians down the St. Louis Browns, 8-2. Winning pitcher
Fritz Coumbe allows two runs in the 4th when he walks George Sisler and
Joe Gedeon follows with an inside-the-park homerun, when LF Jack Graney,
thinking the line drive is foul, doesn't chase the ball. It is Gedeon's
only ML homerun.

1919
Anticipating a poor season at the gate, the major leagues open a reduced
140-game season. Despite the lack of close races, attendance remains high
all year and every club will show a profit, a complete reversal of the
previous year.

The season opens in Washington with General Peyton C. March, Army Chief of
Staff, throwing out the first ball. Walter Johnson wins a magnificent 1-0,
13-inning duel with the A's Scott Perry, scattering 9 hits and striking
out 6. Johnson will beat the A's three times this year by a 1-0 score,
tying the AL and ML record. For the second time in his career he'll win a
total of five 1-0 games, tying the ML mark.

Before a capacity crowd at Redland Field in Cincinnati, Cuban righty Dolf
Luque tops the Cardinals 6-2. Wee Willie Sherdel takes the loss.

At the Polo Grounds, 30,000 fans watch the Red Sox roll over the Yankees,
10-0, behind Carl Mays. Babe Ruth bounces a ball over Lewis' head for
an inside-the-park homer in his first at-bat and drives in 2 runs, while
Wally Schang has three doubles and a single. Former Sox star Duffy Lewis,
who missed the 1918 season while serving in the military, is hitless in his
Yankee debut. George Mogridge takes the loss, allowing six runs in the 9th
inning when SS Roger Peckinpaugh makes his 2nd and 3rd errors of the game.

1921
In the final game of the 4-game series with St. Louis, Cleveland SS Joe
Sewell is spiked in the heel and forced to leave the game. Brownie manager
Fohl allows Jack Graney to be a "courtesy runner" for Sewell, who exits
for repairs, and then returns to his position. The Indians win, 7-3.

1922
The Browns top the White Sox, 4-2, as Ken Williams poles a homer off
Clarence Hodge.

1923
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants win an odd one from the Braves, 7-3. Pitcher
Art Nehf allows just one hit while 1B George Kelly has 21 chances. Boston
makes 5 double plays.

In a 7-7 tie with the Browns, White Sox pitcher Red Faber swipes home in
the 4th inning.

1924
On WMAQ, Hal Totten, a Chicago Daily News play-by-play reporter, does a
play-by-play radio report of the 12-1 Cubs' victory over the Cardinals. It
will be the first broadcast of every Cub and White Sox home game of the
season marking the first time a team's games have been on the airwaves on
a regular basis.

1925
In the 3rd inning at St. Louis, Rogers Hornsby is hit on the head by a
pitch from the Reds' Dolf Luque (as noted by Retrosheet). A groggy Rajah
is replaced with a courtesy runner, Specs Toporcer. Hornsby returns to the
field in the 4th but after 2 innings is taken to the hospital. He'll miss
2 games with a slight concussion. The Reds win, 7-2.

Yankee ace Herb Pennock holds a 1-0 lead into the 9th when Washington loads
the bases. Nats manager Harris wants Walter Johnson to pinch hit, but the Big
Train is in showering when he gets the call. It takes him ten minutes to dress
and enter the game, all the while Yankee manager Huggins is screaming about
the delay. Johnson justifies the wait by hitting the first pitch for a 2-run
single to win the game for Washington, 2-1. Six weeks later, Ban Johnson will
rule that only players on the bench or sidelines may be used as substitutes.

1927
At Philadelphia, Rube Walberg gives up successive homers to Ruth and Gehrig
in the 1st inning, but holds on for a 4-3 A's win. Yankee SS Mark Koenig's
wild throw in the 9th allows the winning run to score.

1929
The Yankees become the first team to wear numbers on their road uniforms
when they invade Fenway Park. The Red Sox are unimpressed and win 4-2.

1932
In Philadelphia, the Yanks outslug the A's, 16-5. It marks the 8th straight
game that New York has homered.

1933
Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak is threatened when he is knocked
unconscious by an Earl Whitehill pitch in the New York-Washington game. He
recovers and finishes the game, a 5-4 loss to the Nats.

1935
The Phils fall to the Dodgers, 12-5, as Benny Frey and Tony Cuccinello
hit 4th inning homers for Brooklyn. Frey's comes with the sacks full. Dolf
Camilli and Johnny Moore homer for the Phils.

Before a NL-record home opener crowd of 47,000 at the Polo Grounds, drawn
to see the Babe play for the Braves, the Giants top Boston, 6-5 in 11
innings. Ruth goes hitless, however. Mel Ott provides the thunder with a
game-winning hit.

1936
In the Dodgers 4-3, 10-inning win over the Giants, Dodgers OF Randy Moore
breaks his right ankle sliding into 2B and will miss most of the season. He'll
return to the active list on July 27 and play in just one more game on the
field before August 27. He'll hit .103 next year, his last. A Mel Ott HR
gives the Giants the lead in the 10th, but the Dodgers counter with 2 runs.

1937
Carl Hubbell's first start of the season is a 3-hit, 3-0 shutout against
the Boston Bees. For the Giants ace, it is his 17th straight win, dating
back to July 17 of last year.

Jersey City, now a Giants farm team, returns to the International League
with the largest crowd, 31,294, in minor league history.

1938
In the first of 2 at Batlimore's Oriole Park, 2 Rochester (IL) pitchers
hold the Orioles to 3 hits, but lose 5-3 (as noted by Al Kermisch). The
three hits - all homers - are all by Pooch Puccinelli, who drives in 5
runs. It is the IL star's third 3-homer game in the loop.

1939
At Griffith Stadium, Senators' right-hander Alejandro Carrasquel faces the
Yankees in his major league debut. The 26-year-old from Caracas becomes
the first player from Venezuela to appear in a major league game.

Chicago's Marv Owen equals a ML record with 4 doubles, as the White Sox
trounce the Browns 17-4.

Against the A's Bud Thomas, Ted Williams connects for his first ML homerun
while going 4 for 5. The A's win 12-8, but Thomas will be waived to the
Senators in a week.

1940
A flood at Crosley Field washes out a game against the St. Louis Cardinals,
the first time a flood has caused the postponement of an NL game. The teams
will later decide to replay the game on May 13th when both teams will be
heading east from St. Louis, but they neglect to inform the NL office.

1941
With Ted Williams on the bench, having reinjured his ankle yesterday, the
Red Sox fall to the Yankees, 4-2, in 11 innings. Joe DiMaggio is hitless,
but Phil Rizzuto provides the offense by hitting his first ML homer,
a 2-run shot off Charlie Wagner in the 11th, to win the contest.

Phillies sidearmer Ike Pearson beans Brooklyn's Pete Reiser on the
cheek. Pearson lasts 7 innings in losing, 4-0, to Whit Wyatt.

In a PCL game, Hollywood's Babe Herman pinch hits in the 9th with 2 out and

draft board on May 7th.

1942
At Detroit, Hal White makes his second ML start and registers his second

a shutout in his first ML start on April 18.

At Washington, the Senators down the Red Sox, 10-5, but lose starter Dutch
Leonard in the second inning when he breaks his ankle on a play at first
base. Leonard will pitch only six games this season.

In Cleveland, Hack Miller homers in his first major league at-bat. The
Tiger catcher, with only ten plate appearances, will hit .444 during his
brief two-year stint with Detroit.

Jim Tobin tosses a one-hitter in the Braves' home opener as Philadelphia
2B Ford Mullen gets the only hit in the 6th inning. In his previous start
Tobin lost a 3-hitter to the Giants.

1946
Ed Head of the Brooklyn Dodgers tosses a no-hitter at the Braves, beating
Boston's Mort Cooper, 5-0, before 30,287 at Ebbets Field. It is Head's
first ML appearance since his return from the military. He last pitched in
the ML on July 9, 1944, when the Pirates knocked him out in 2 innings. Head
was a left-handed pitcher until 1935 when he broke his pitching arm and he
was forced to pitch right-handed.

The Permanent Committee of the Hall of Fame announces the selection of 11
old-time players to membership in the Hall of Fame. Eleven former players
- Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance, Jess Burkett, Tom McCarthy, Rube
Waddell, Eddie Plank, Ed Walsh, Jack Chesbro, Clark Griffith and Joe McGinnity
- are named. The committee also reveals the names of 39 others - managers,
executives, umpires and sportswriters - to the new "Honor Rolls of Baseball."

1947
Rudy York's 2 hits are it for Boston as the Yankees Allie Reynolds shuts
out the Hubmen, 3-0. Boo Ferriss is the loser.

At Detroit, the Tigers use consecutive solo homers in the 8th from
Roy Cullenbine, Dick Wakefield and Hoot Evers to beat the White Sox,
7-4. Cullenbine adds an earlier homer and Eddie Lake adds a 5th Bengal
blast to back Fred Hutchinson's win over Eddie Lopat.

The Yankees release veteran reliever Johnny Murphy who will sign with the
Red Sox.

1948
The Cards spoil the home opener for the Cubs, nipping Chicago, 1-0, despite
garnering just two hits off Johnny Schmitz. Harry Brecheen is the winner.

On the 25th anniversary of the opening of Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox spoil
the ceremonies by stopping New York, 4-0. A sick Babe Ruth cheers on the
Yanks from the dugout.

1950
In the second of two games, the Braves and Phillies start the match in
daylight and finish under the lights, a first in the majors. Phils win,
6-5. Johnny Sain hurls the Braves to a 4-3 win over the visiting Phils in
the opener.

1952
Future Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm of the New York Giants wins his first ML
game pitching 5 1/3 innings in relief in a 9-5 win. In his first at bat he
cleans a pitch from the Braves' Dick Hoover for a homer. In his second big
league appearance at the plate two days later he will hit a three-bagger,
but during the next 21 years, covering a span 1070 games, the knuckle-balling
hurler will never triple or homer again. In today's game the loser is rookie
Gene Conley.

Vinegar Bend Mizell, the Cards highly touted rookie, allows just 5 hits
in his ML debut, but he is shaded by the Reds Ken Raffensberger, who wins,
2-1. The game was marred by ejections of Stanky, Hemus and Brazle. Stanky's
banishment, his first as a manager, follows a strike call by ump Scotty
Robb. The NL will fine and reprimand Robb for pushing Stanky. Stanky and
Hemus also receive fines.

Bob Cain of the Browns and Bob Feller of the Indians each pitch a one-hitter,
with the Browns prevailing 1-0 and moving into first place. The game ties a
ML record for the fewest hits by two teams and sets the AL record. The last
double one-hitter was July 4, 1906. The Browns Bobby Young hits a triple in
the first inning and scores the lone run with an Al Rosen error on Marty
Marion's grounder. The Indians only hit is a single by Luke Easter. For
Feller, it is the 4th time he's tossed a one-hitter against the Brownies and
his 11th career one-hitter. It'll be 35 years before another Tribe tosser,
Tom Candiotti, pitches a one-hit loss.

1953
At Yankee Stadium, Mantle breaks a 3-3 tie with a two out 9th-inning
three-run homer off Red Sox relief ace Ellis Kinder.

1954

first of his 755 ML HRs, a solo shot off Vic Raschi of St. Louis. The Braves
win in 14 innings 7-5 on an error by Hemus. Card rookie Wally Moon is 5 for 5.

Jackie Robinson steals 2B and 3B, then swipes home on the front end of
a triple steal with Gil Hodges and Sandy Amoros in the 6th against the
Pirates. The Dodgers win 6-5 in 13 innings when Robinson doubles home
Junior Gilliam.

1955
The visiting White Sox erupt for 29 hits in a 29-6 ripping of Kansas
City. C Sherm Lollar becomes the only man in the decade to get 2 hits in
one inning twice in the same game. Lollar's feat comes in the 2nd and 6th
innings. Chico Carrasquel goes 5 for 6 as the White Sox pound out 7 HRs. Bob
Nieman has 7 RBIs to pace the Sox offensive attack with 2 homers; Lollar
(2), Walt Dropo, pitcher Jack Harshman and Minnie Minoso also homer. Chico
Carrasquel and Minoso each score 5 runs. KC gets homers from Vic Power and
Bill Renna. Bobby Shantz takes the loss. The White Sox tie a modern major
league mark for most runs scored by a single team in a game as they drub
the A's, 29-6. The Red Sox also scored 29 runs against the Browns in 1950.

In a celebrated fight with the Dodgers, Alvin Dark takes on Jackie Robinson
after the latter bowls over pitcher Sheldon Jones, covering first on a
bunt. Jones injures his back in the incident. Brooklyn wins 3-1.

1956
Rookie Don Drysdale makes his first ML start a dandy by striking out the
side in the first inning. He strikes out 9 as Brooklyn beats the Phils, 6-1.

1957
At Fenway, Ted Williams belts a CF homer and a single to drive in 2 runs
as the Red Sox beat the Orioles, 3-1. Frank Sullivan allows 4 hits in
winning. The Sox Gene Mauch hits into an unusual DP with Dick Gernert on
3B. Mauch grounds to 1B George Kell, who steps on 1B and throws home. Mauch
throws up his hands and deflects the throw. Gernert is ruled out on the
interference call.

1958
At the Los Angles Coliseum, Dodger first baseman Gil Hodges hits his 300th
career homerun and Captain Pee Wee Reese plays in his 2000th game in a 7-6
loss to the Cubs. Duke Snider injures his arm before the game trying to
throw a ball out of the Los Angeles Coliseum. Unamused Dodger officials
dock him a day's pay.

In an ongoing dispute with soap operatic properties, a Chicago Court orders
Mrs. Dorothy Comiskey Rigney to distribute stock from her mother's estate,
so she can not effectively bar her brother Charles A. Comiskey from sitting
on the White Sox Board.

Herb Score strikes out 13 and allows 3 hits as Cleveland beats the White Sox,
2-0. Billy Pierce takes the loss.

1959

3-2, snapping his 12-game winning streak over Washington. Russ Kemmerer is
the winner, despite allowing a HR to Mantle.

says the team will stay in Cuba despite the political unrest.

1961
Art Mahaffey fans at least one batter in each inning and 17 in all,

game 1-0 behind Frank Sullivan's pitching and a game-ending homer by Bobby
Smith off Dick Ellsworth.

1962
Jay Hook gives the New York Mets their first regular-season victory,
a 5-hit 9-1 win at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is now 10-1 for the season,
but will lose 13 of its next 17 games.

1964
Houston's Ken Johnson becomes the first pitcher ever to hurl a 9-inning
no-hitter and lose as Cincinnati wins, 1-0. Two errors in the 9th, the
second by 2B Nellie Fox on Vada Pinson's grounder, allows Pete Rose to
score the only run. Joe Nuxhall wins with a 4-hitter.

1966
Two days after putting on a Cubs uniform, Ferguson Jenkins hits his first
major league homer, off Don Sutton, drives in a 2nd run, and shuts out
the Dodgers to win, 2-0. For rookie Sutton, it is the first of 13 straight
losses the Cubs will hand him.

1968
The Cubs make a canny trade acquiring P Phil Regan and OF Jim Hickman from
the Dodgers for OF Ted Savage and P Jim Ellis.

1969
A ten-inning complete-game pitching duel, that includes Detroit's Denny
McLain retiring 21 straight batters and Baltimore's Mike Cuellar getting
20 consecutive hitters, is won by Cuellar and the Orioles, 3-2, when Mark
Belanger's single plates Ellie Hendricks, who had doubled to start the
final frame snapping the Tigers' right-hander's streak. At season's end
both starters will share the Cy Young Award when the writer's choice for
the prestigious honor results in a tie in the ballot box.

1972
Trailing by four runs at Candlestick Park, the Astros score ten times in the
ninth inning (sending 14 men to the plate) to beat the Giants, 13-7. The
final frame fireworks are fueled by seven hits, two walks, a passed ball
and an error. Cesar Cedeno collects 5 hits, including 2 in the 9th when he
drives in 3 runs. May has a 3-run homer in the 9th.

Greg Luzinski homers in the 9th to tie the score, then triples and scores
in the 11th to give the Phils a 5-4 victory over the Pirates. Luzinski also
doubles and scores in the 2nd.

1975
The Yankees' Roy White again homers from both sides of the plate, this time
in an 11-7 loss to the Red Sox. White last switch-hit HRs on August 13, 1973.

it is not enough as Detroit wins, 7-6.

1978
Reds 2B Joe Morgan commits an error during a 2-1, 10-inning win over the

and strand 14 runners.

1980
Angels P Bruce Kison settles for a one-hitter when Minnesota's Ken Landreaux
rips a double with one out in the 9th inning of California's 17-0 romp. It
is the 2nd time in a year that Kison has lost a no-hitter with one out in
the 9th. For Landreaux, the hit marks the beginning of a 31-game hitting
streak. The loser today is Terry Felton.

1981
The White Sox sweep the O's, pounding Baltimore for 26 hits in the opener
and scoring in each of the 1st six innings to win 18-5. Almon and Lemon each

1989
Nolan Ryan is 2 outs from a no-hitter when Nelson Liriano triples and Ryan

most Ks in a row by a relief pitcher. Dibble records his 2nd save of the
year as the Reds defeat the Astros, 3-1.

Manager Nick Leyva is fired by the Phillies after just 13 games, and
replaced by Jim Fregosi. It is the second-fastest firing in major league
history. Cal Ripken Sr was fired by Baltimore after 6 games in 1988. Under
Fregosi, the Phils lose their 10th in 14 games, dropping a 2-1 decision to
the Mets. Jason Grimsley is the loser as both Mets score on walks.

In the top of the 6th at Fenway, the Jays' John Olerud is at-bat when
Sox pitcher Roger Clemens catches Joe Carter napping and picks off the

while the O's drop their 6th straight.

In Milwaukee, the A's rack up nine runs off knuckler Steve Sparks, with
Scott Brosius banging a 3-run homer in the first and a solo shot in the
4th. Jason Giambi tallies a double in the first off Sparks, a triple in the
2nd, and a two run homer in the 4th. With teammates urging him to stop at
first on any hit, Giambi lines out his next two times up. The A's need all
9 runs as the Brewers battle back to lose, 9-6.

1998
Brewers' OF Marquis Grissom hits his 103rd career homer in Milwaukee's
2-1 win over the Dodgers. He surpasses Lou Piniella's old record for most
homers without a multiple-HR game. Grissom eventually reaches 109 career
HR before hitting a pair on September 26.

1999
The Cardinals defeat the Dodgers, 12-5, as 3B Fernando Tatis sets a major
league record by hitting 2 grand slams in a single inning. His 2 homers
came in St. Louis' 11-run 3rd inning. He also sets a record with 8 RBIs in
the inning, while LA P Chan Ho Park becomes the 1st pitcher this century -
and only the 2nd ever - to surrender 2 grand slams in a single frame. Bill
Phillips of the Pirates did so in 1890. Park became the 36th major-leaguer
to serve up two slams to the same player in his career.

At Fenway, ex-Red Sox hitter Wil Cordero hits a 2-run HR, off Jim Corsi,
in the 6th to give the Indians a 7-6 win over Boston. His hit follows
the 2nd bench clearing brawl of the game. Rheal Cormier plunks Jim Thome
and Corsi relieves. The first brawl comes in the 5th after Jarret Wright
allows a homer, walk and single, then hits Darren Lewis with a pitch. Both
are tossed. Lofton, leading off, and Fryman homer for Cleveland. The AL
will suspend Indians P Jaret Wright (5 games) and 1B Jim Thome (3 days),
and Red Sox OF Darren Lewis (3 days) and P Rheal Cormier (3 games) for
participating in the brawls. All will appeal.

The Brewers sink the Pirates, 9-1, as P Steve Woodard hurls the complete game
victory. The win ends Milwaukee's NL record streak of 113 games without
a complete game. 3B Jeff Cirillo leads the Brewer attack with 3 hits,
including a double and HR, and 4 RBIs.

The Indians trade P Jerry Spradlin to the Giants for OF Dan McKinley and
a player to be named.

Royals P Hipolito Pichardo undergoes right elbow surgery which will keep
him out the rest of the season.

Wichita State University P Ben Christensen hits Evansville leadoff hitter
Anthony Molina with a warm-up pitch while Molina is about 30 feet from the
plate. Molina receives 23 stitches to close a gash. Christensen explains
that he thought Molina was trying to time his pitches, and says pitching
coach Brent Kemnitz has instructed pitchers to brush back the on-deck hitter

all-time won-loss record during their 122 years of existence in the Windy
City.
