Phillies. New York wins, 7-0, beating Harry Felix, before a crowd of 24,000.

According to the NY Evening Telegram, the Superbas also have a band in
Brooklyn, and the music is "On a Sunday Afternoon," a curious choice for
a Thursday home opener. Bill Donovan beats Boston, 2-1.

The Reds open a new ball park called "the Palace of the Fans" and inaugurate
the occasion by losing to Chicago, 6-1. John Taylor wins his 2nd straight
opener.

Christy Mathewson, but New York counters to take a 5-4 lead. Matty allows
another 5 runs as his teammates contribute six errors. Brooklyn wins, 9-7,
behind rookie Henry Schmidt.

1904
By not charging admission but requiring fans to buy a scorecard, the
Brooklyn Superbas are able to play their first Sunday game. The strategy
is an attempt to circumvent the existing blue laws, legislation designed
to enforce religious edicts, including the observance of Sunday as a day
of worship. The Superbas beat the Boston Beaneaters, 9-1, behind Oscar Jones.

1906
At Detroit, the Tigers drop their home Opener, 5-3, to the White Sox and
Frank Owen. A crowd of 13,875 is on hand at Bennett Field, which holds just
7,000. Crowds pack along the foul line.

At Chicago, the Browns' Rube Waddell makes his first start of the year,
shutting out the White Sox, 1-0, on one hit, a single by Jake Atz. Only
one ball is hit out of the infield. Owen is the loser with 8 innings of work.

bases or better, topped by Josh Devore's 61 and Larry Doyle's 38.

Addie Joss' funeral is held at Toledo with Billy Sunday preaching the
sermon. The funeral is the 2nd largest in the city's history. His Cleveland
teammates insist on being there, forcing postponement of the season opener.

A bill to permit Sunday baseball is refused in the lower house of the New
Jersey legislature.

1913
After two losses and four rainouts, the Giants finally register a victory,
in Boston, winning 3-2 in 10 innings. Larry Doyle collects 4 of the 5 New

one more decision, a loss, before being set adrift.

1915
Behind their ace Pete Alexander, the Phils drill the Giants, 7-1, their 2nd
successive victory by that score. Christy Mathewson lasts just 4 innings in
taking the loss, as Gavvy Cravath deep sixes Big Six with a double and homer.

In his first game with the Browns, Hank Severeid hits his first ML HR, a
3-run blast off Hi Jasper, who had given up just one hit, to propel the Browns
to a 4-3 win over the White Sox. Severeid played for the Reds from 1911-13.

reportedly contains 2,300 square yards of canvas.

1916
At Fenway, Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson square off with the young Red Sox
lefty emerging the winner, 5-1, over the Washington ace. Ruth scatters 8 hits
in 6 innings and strikes out 6, while Johnson gives up 11 hits before being
lifted in the 6th. Rain starts falling in the 7th and the game is called.

Detroit scores a 12-inning 3-1 victory over Stan Coveleski in his first
year at Cleveland. Righthander George Cunningham fills in when Tiger ace

Charlotte comes back with 10 runs in the bottom of the frame.

1923

are disappointed as Johnny Morrison stops the Cubs, 3-2, to give Pittsburgh
the win.

Cards. Pete Donohue tops Les Sell. The Redbirds are wearing uniform numbers
corresponding to their position in the batting order.

In the longest NL opener to date, Brooklyn and Philadelphia battle to a
14-inning 5-5 tie. Dutch Ruether, who beat the Phils 7 straight in 1922,
goes the distance.

noted by Retrosheet). Huber returns to play 3B in the 4th before Clarence
Whiteside takes over in the 5th. The magnanimous Phils win, 15-3.

1927
At St. Louis, the Browns take a 5-3 lead into the 9th inning, then watch as

to pick up the victory.

1929
In a ceremony that takes place on Opening Day at five a.m. to avoid
crowds, Claire Hodgson becomes the second Mrs. Babe Ruth. The Yankee home

uninterrupted. The Yankees' outfielder's first wife, Julia Woodford, died
in a house fire in January.

On a cold and dreary day at Griffith Stadium, President Herbert Hoover
throws out the first ball and then stays for the entire game watching the
A's beat the hometown Senators, 13-4. The loss spoils the managerial debut

out Boston, 5-0, on Hal Schumacher's 2-hitter.

1934
On Opening Day at the newly-named Crosley Field, Reds' announcer Red Barber
calls his first play-by-play for a major league team. The 26-year-old
future Hall of Fame broadcaster had never attended a major league game
before today's 6-0 loss to Chicago.

Both leagues open with full schedules and draw 180,000 in attendance. The
Cubs' Lon Warneke gives up just a one-out 9th-inning single to Adam Comorosky,
winning 6-0 over the Reds. He strikes out 13 in the one-hitter to set a
20th century club mark, since topped, for K's in an opener. Sam Jones will
match Warneke in 1956. John Clarkson holds the club mark with 16 set on
August 18, 1886.

At Ebbets, Casey Stengel makes his managerial debut, but his Dodgers lose,
8-7, to the Braves.

In a pre-game ceremony at the Polo Grounds, a bugler sounded taps for John
McGraw, who died in February. The Giants, behind Carl Hubbell, then defeat
the Phillies, 6-1, to start a five-game win streak.

At the rebuilt Fenway Park, the Red Sox unveil the Green Monster, the
18-foot concrete wall that replaces "Duffy's Cliff," the 10-foot-incline
named after Hugh Duffy. Gone are the wooden bleachers and wooden fences,
and a warning track is in place for the outfielders. In front of the largest
crowd to date in Boston history, the Senators defeat the rejuvenated Red
Sox, 6-5, in 11 innings, when player manager Joe Cronin cracks a run-scoring
double. Starter Earl Whitehill pitches 6 innings and hits a single and homer,
just the 3rd Opening Day HR ever for the Nats ... the last was 1916.

At Shibe Park, a crowd of less than 10,000 watch the A's open against the
Yankees. New York scores first with two runs in the 5th inning off starter
Sugar Cain. The A's take the lead in the 6th inning on Eric McNair's two-run
homer, off Lefty Gomez, into the LF upper deck, but the Yankees pull ahead
5-3 in the 8th. The A's answer with one in the 8th, another in the 9th,
and then, with two outs, a pinch single by Bing Miller provides the winning
run. Rookie Joe Cascarella, a native Philadelphian, is the winner, while
Harry Smythe is the losing pitcher.

At Comiskey Park, the White Sox move the plate 17 feet closer to the fences to
help Al Simmons, but there are no homers today as the Tigers win, 8-4. When
Simmons leaves next year, the plate is moved back.

1935
President Roosevelt throws out the first ball at the delayed Washington
opener. Jimmie Foxx homers, but the Senators beat the A's, 4-3.

keeping the crowd short of 1500 - by winning the 10-inning contest, 13-10.

Lefty Grove and the Red Sox take the Yankees' home opener, 8-0, before a
shivering crowd of 22,256. Grove pitches a masterful 2-hitter, with Lou
Gehrig collecting 2 singles.

In a PCL match, Eddie Joost has 6 hits to pace Mission to a 13-6 win over
Sacramento. Mission pitcher Boom Boom Beck has a pair of homers. Beck will
go 18-21 this year and have another 20-loss season in 1937.

1939
On the morning of Opening Day in Washington, D.C, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt and the Yankees visit Abner Doubleday's grave at Arlington
National Cemetery. FDR is also scheduled to throw out the first pitch at

honors four days later.

the 8th for a 7-5 win. Frank McCormick homers for the Reds.

Reiser are greeted in their first at-bats by a trumpet-playing fan who
serenades them with "Here Comes The Bride." The Dodgers beat the Phils 7-1.

1945
Cincinnati opens the season with an 11-inning, 7-6 victory over the
Pirates. The Reds offense was sparked by CF Dain Clay, who cracks a 5th
inning grand slam ... it will be his only HR this year in 645 at bats. Also
in the 5th, with the Pirates leading 2-0 with 2 runners on, the Bucs runner
at 2B, Frankie Zak, calls time to tie his shoe lace. The ump Ziggy Sears
waves his arms, but Reds pitcher Bucky Walters doesn't see him and fires
a pitch that Jim Russell hits for an apparent HR. The hit is disallowed,
and the Bucs fail to score in the frame. Forty-six-year-old Hod Lisenbee,
who had not appeared in the majors in 9 years, works two innings of hitless
relief to earn the win, the 37th and last of his career.

Steady rain holds the crowd at Yankee Stadium to 13,923 as Mayor Fiorello
LaGuardia throws out the first ball for the Opener against the Red Sox. The
Yanks' lone score until the 7th inning is a homer by rookie Russ Derry
in the 3rd off Rex Cecil. Meanwhile the Red Sox jump on Atley Donald for
three runs in the 1st inning and another in the 7th on Ben Steiner's solo
homer. But helped by four Boston errors, and another homer by Russ Derry -
this one a grand slam, New York scores seven runs in the 7th inning to finish
the scoring at 8-4. Sox first baseman George Metkovich makes a ML record 3
errors in the frame on a missed tag, bad throw and fumble. Forty-one-year-old
Jim Turner pitches the last two innings for New York.

In Philadelphia, the Dodgers win the Opener, 8-2, over the Phils. The Phils
have 18-year-old Granny Hamner, in his 2nd season, at shortstop, with older
brother Garvin Hamner, in his only season, at 2B.

At Cleveland, Thornton Lee is the winning pitcher in the White Sox 5-2
victory over the Indians. Tony Cuccinello helps with a successful hidden
ball trick in the 6th on Lou Boudreau at 3B. For Cooch, it is at least his
4th successful use of the ploy, the first coming in 1929. As historian Bill
Deane notes, this is the first time the trick has worked on Opening Day.

Pete Gray, the one-armed OF, plays his ML debut game with the St. Louis
Browns. He singles once, off Les Mueller, in four at-bats, and handles no
chances in the outfield. St. Louis beats the Tigers, 7-1, for their 9th
straight Opening Day win, a ML record that the 1975-83 Mets will tie.

In Boston, Giants player-manager Mel Ott has a field day by setting six ML
records in his team's 11-6 win. Ott collects a double, two walks and three
runs. His records for a player with one team include 1,026 extra-base hits,
2076 total bases, 1,778 RBIs, 1,787 runs, 1,631 walks and 20 years with
one team.

1947
The Dodgers win 12-6 over the Braves at home, as Jackie Robinson gets his
first ML hit - a bunt single, off Glenn Elliot. Robinson will bunt 42 times,
collecting 19 hits, during the year. The Brooklyn offense is led by fellow
rookie Johnny "Spider" Jorgensen, who drives in 6 runs.

Hank Greenberg belts his first NL homer in the 2nd, and the Pirates score
6 more in the 7th to beat the host Cubs, 7-1. Preacher Roe doesn't allow
a hit until the 7th.

1949
In Philadelphia, the A's defeat the Phils, 5-2, to capture their city
series. Buddy Rosar hits a homer in the 7th.

The Yankees lose, 9-4, to the Dodgers, and also lose Bob Porterfield for
a month. He suffers a torn muscle in his pitching arm on his last pitch of
the game.

1951
Prior to the Cubs' home opener, Sam Snead tees off from home plate and hits
the center field scoreboard at Wrigley Field. "Slammin' Sammy" won three
Masters, three PGA Championships and one British Open during his nearly 40
years as a professional golfer.

For the first time, in a career that will span more than half of a century,
Bob Sheppard announces the Yankees' lineup. Sheppard who won't miss a Yankee
opener until 2006. The legendary public address announcer's introduction
of the Bronx Bombers will include the names of team icons Mickey Mantle,
Phil Rizzuto and Yogi Berra, but the first player's name off the lips of the
'Voice of God' will be DiMaggio - Dom DiMaggio, the leadoff batter for the
visiting Red Sox. Clad in an army uniform, Whitey Ford tosses out the first
pitch at Yankee Stadium, and Vic Raschi scatters six singles to shut out the
Red Sox, 5-0. Bill Wight gives up all the Yankee runs, including a two-run
homer to Jackie Jensen in the 3rd inning. Mickey Mantle, making his debut
before 44,860, has one hit and scores a run. The 19-year-old right-fielder
grounds out to second base in his first major league at-bat.

The Athletics play the first home Opening Day night game in AL history,
losing to Washington, 6-1. Forty-year-old Connie Marrero is the winner as
batterymate Mickey Grasso homers.

1952
Umpire Bill Summers turns in 7 members of the White Sox and Indians for
"fraternizing" before a game, won by the Indians 7-3. The AL fines the
unnamed players $5 each for violating the 1951 rule.

1953
Mickey Mantle blasts a 'reported' 565-foot homer off southpaw Chuck
Stobbs in the Yankees' 7-3 victory over Washington at a windy Griffith
Stadium. The distance of the historic round-tripper hit by the 21-year-old
Yankee outfielder will become the subject of much debate, with later
research debunking its original tape measure status. The 5th inning blow,
with Berra on first base, clears the stadium in left center, just ticking
off the huge Ballantine scoreboard, standing 60 feet higher than the grand
stand bleachers. The ball lands in the backyard of Perry Cool, a block away
from the ball park. The Mick adds a stolen base to his day's total.

The Milwaukee Braves drop their first game, losing 10-9 to the Reds. Rookie
Billy Bruton has 3 hits for the Braves, and is 8 for 14 for the short season.

With the temperature at 36 degrees in St. Louis, the Browns edge the White
Sox, 6-4.

1954
At Milwaukee's County Stadium, utility man Nino Escalera becomes the first
black player to appear in a Reds' game when he hits a pinch single in a
5-1 loss to the Braves. In the 7th, another black rookie, Chuck Harmon,
follows, pinch hitting for Corky Valentine and popping out. Escalera,
a Puerto Rican native, who will bat .159 and collect 11 hits in his only
major league season, will eventually become a scout for the Oakland A's.

The wind is blowing out at Wrigley, as the Cards lose 23-13 to the Cubs in
a NL record 3 hour and 43 minute game. The two teams combine for 35 hits,
including five homers. Bruce Edwards walks twice in the 5th, when the Cubs
score 10 runs. Cubs 3B Randy Jackson has 4 hits, including a HR that hits
an apartment building on Waveland Avenue. Jim Brosnan is the winner over
Gerry Staley in the highest scoring game ever between these two rivals.

Joe Coleman of the Orioles loses a 3-hitter to the Tigers, 1-0. Ned Garver
allows 5 hits in winning.

1955
Roberto Clemente singles off Dodger pitcher Johnny Podres in his first major
league at-bat. Roberto Clemente goes 1 for 4 with visiting Dodgers winning,
10-3. The Pirates' rookie, who will die in a plane crash attempting to
bring relief aid to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua in 1972, will collect
3,000 hits during his 18-year major league career, all with Pittsburgh.

Twenty-year-old Al Kaline of the Tigers hits 3 HRs in Briggs Stadium,
including 2 in the 6th inning to drive in 6 runs. The Tigers rout the A's,
16-0, behind Steve Gromek's pitching. Kaline is the first American Leaguer
since DiMaggio in 1936 to hit 2 homers in an inning, and he is the first
Tiger to do so.

After the Cubs edge the Cards, 6-5, in the opener, St. Louis scores 10 in
the first inning and go on to rout the Cubs, 14-1, in the nitecap.

1956
President Eisenhower throws out the first ball in Washington - actually two
balls, both replicas of Spalding's 1876 ball, and the Yanks and Senators
each hit 3 HRs, the only time this has happened on Opening Day. Hitting LH,
Mickey Mantle has 2 tape measure CF blasts over 500 feet off Camilo Pascual,
as the Yanks win easily 10-4. Berra is 4 for 4 with a double and homer and
5 RBIs to ease the way for winner Don Larsen. Pascual takes the loss. Karl
Olson has two homers for Washington, the only time in history a Senator has
gone deep twice on opening day, and rookie Dick Tettelbach hits another, his
only major league round tripper. All but Mantle take advantage of the new
shortened dimensions of Griffith Stadium. For the 3rd consecutive opener,
President Dwight D. Eisenhower stays for 9 innings after throwing out the
first ball.

Oops. When fans are directed to stand for the National Anthem at Ebbets
Field there is a long silence before singer Everett McCooey asks over the
loud speaker, "who's going to raise the flag?" The flag and the championship
flag are then hoisted. It is better than the Opener in 1913 at Ebbets Field
when everyone forgot to bring a flag. The Dodgers then lose to the Phils, 8-6.

Despite 2 HRs by Dale Long, Pittsburgh loses to New York, 4-3, when Willie
Mays scores from 2B in the 8th inning on Daryl Spencer's groundout to
2B. Bob Friend loses to Johnny Antonelli, who also clubs a HR.

Frank Robinson makes his ML debut with a double, off Vinegar Bend Mizell,
in his 1st at-bat. But the Cards beat the Reds, 4-2, when Musial hits a
2-out 2-run 9th-inning homer.

At Milwaukee, Lew Burdette shuts out the Cubs, 6-0, and gets help from Hank
Aaron and Joe Adcock, who hit homers.

At Fenway, Ted Williams crosses up the "Williams Shift" by rapping 2 doubles
to left and a single to CF to lead the Red Sox to an 8-1 win over the
Orioles. Piersall also has 3 hits. Frank Sullivan is the winner allowing 8
hits and an unearned run and helping the offense with an unusual DP for an
RBI. With the bases loaded in the 3rd, Sullivan flies to RF with Piersall
scoring from 3B and Sammy White thrown out at 2B by RF Dave Philley. The
pitcher hits into a DP, gets an RBI and has no time at-bat.

The White Sox, losers of their last 10 exhibition games, edge the visiting
Indians, 2-1, on Bob Lemon's bases-loaded walk. Jim Busby, traded by the
Sox over the winter, accounts for the only Tribe tally with a homerun.

Gus Zernial hits a pinch double to drive in 2 runs and spoil the one-man
effort of Detroit's Frank Lary. The A's win, 2-1. Lary hurls a 6-hitter
and accounts for the only run with an inside-the-park HR off Alex Kellner.

1958
At Yankee Stadium, Mickey Mantle leads New York to a 3-1 win over the Red
Sox. Mantle hits his first homer of the year, off Tom Brewer. Then when
Pete Daley lines a ball off the wall in left center, Mantle plays the carom
perfectly and throws the runner out at 2B.

The Athletics trade P Arnold Portocarrero to Baltimore for P Bud Daley.

1959
Led by rookies Rudy Arias and Norm Cash, the White Sox top Detroit 6-5. Arias
picks up his 1st win and Cash contributes a 3-run HR.

Boston's Tom Brewer shuts out the Yankees, 4-0, on 2 hits, besting Bob
Turley who beat him last week. It is the 1st shut out by a Bosox pitcher
since August 7, 1956 - a 55 game stretch.

1960
On Easter Sunday, Frank Lane brings AL batting champ Harvey Kuenn to
Cleveland and sends co-HR champ Rocky Colavito to Detroit. Colavito,
an unparalleled fan favorite in Cleveland, had been a brief Spring hold
out for more money. Colavito was on first base in an exhibition game in
Memphis against the White Sox when manager Joe Gordon informed him of the
trade. Rocky will hit 173 HRs before returning to the Tribe on January 20,
1965. Kuenn will report to Cleveland, pull a muscle, and never be the same
hitter. He'll be traded after one season.

Eddie Mathews hits his 300th HR, off Robin Roberts, plus a double and
triple, as Milwaukee beats Philadelphia 8-4. To date, only Jimmie Foxx hit
his 300th at a younger age.

Pittsburgh's Joe Gibbon makes his ML debut in the 2nd game of a twinbill
with the Reds. With the Pirates down 5-0 in the 8th, the rookie comes in
to mop up. Gibbon throws 2 scoreless innings and the Bucs score 6 in the
9th for a 6-5 win. Hal Smith's 3-run pinch homer and Bob Skinner's 2-out,
two-run homer off reliever Ted Wieand makes Gibbon the winner. The Bucs
win the opener, 5-0, behind Bob Friend's 4-hitter.

1961
In a 9-5 St. Louis win in the opener of a doubleheader, Dodger Duke Snider

list. But in his next at-bat, the Duke suffers the consequences, sustaining
a broken elbow when hit by a Bob Gibson pitch.

the Mets play their first game at Shea Stadium in front of 50,312 fans in
Queens. The Amazins' drop the stadium opener to Pittsburgh, 4-3, with Willie
Stargell hitting the first homer in the Flushing facility. Bob Friend is
the winner over Cuban righty Ed Bauta. Friend was also the winning pitcher
in the last game ever played at the Polo Grounds before the Giants moved west.

The wind picks up at Wrigley Field and, in the 5th inning, the Phils loft

have beaten big Don.

In Kansas City, the Yanks top the A's, 5-2, with all of New York's scoring
coming via homeruns. With NY ahead, 2-1, in the 8th, Maris walks and Mantle

1968
With a 13-1 rout of the Senators, the Twins are 6-0 and lead the AL.

with a single, four consecutive HRs (including the game winner), and 8
RBIs to overcome a 12-1 deficit after three innings and beat the Cubs in

against St. Louis in 1932.

After agreeing on a $1.25 million deal last week, Johnny Damon signs a
minor league contract enroute to joining the Indians to possibly become
their regular left fielder. The 38-year-old career .286 hitter, who needs

club by providing veteran leadership for the struggling Tribe in addition
to serving as a mentor to the team's younger stars.

Mark Melancon allows six earned runs without recording an out in the eighth
inning, a frame which features three homeruns to the six Rangers he faces
in the 18-3 rout of the Red Sox at Fenway Park. The Boston reliever yields

innings, 15 2/3 more than was needed by Hideo Nomo, who established the
team mark in 2003.

2019
The Dodgers tied a Major League record by hitting a homerun in 32 straight
home games, against the Cincinnati Reds. A.J. Pollock hit the record tying
homerun in the sixth inning. The streak started, and only includes the regular
season, on August 21, 2018. This tied the record that was previously held
by the 1999 Colorado Rockies. The Dodgers set the new record their next home
game on April 26 against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Cody Bellinger's homerun
in the first inning. The streak came to an end, at 33 consecutive games,
the very next game against the Pirates.
