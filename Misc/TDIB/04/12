1905
The Washington owners offer the players a $1,000 bonus if they finish
higher than 8th and $500 for each position higher. They will finish 7th,
11 games above St. Louis.

1906
Boston (NL) OF Johnny Bates becomes the first modern player to hit a homer in
his first ML at-bat when he connects in the 2nd inning against the Brooklyn
Superbas' Harry McIntire. Boston hurler Irv Young allows only one hit -
a double by Lumley - and wins, 2-0.

With Mathewson sidelined with diphtheria, Red Ames pitches the Opener for
the Giants, a 3-2 win over the Phils at Baker Bowl.

1909
Billy Sullivan, the White Sox catcher in the first AL game, replaces Fielder
Jones as manager.

The 61-year history of Philadelphia's Shibe Park begins as a record
crowd of 31,160 sees 18-year-old John "Stuffy" McInnis make his ML debut
at SS. Eddie Plank pitches the A's to an 8-1 win over Boston, allowing 6
hits. A's catcher Mike "Doc" Powers injures himself going after a foul pop,
and after the game complains of intestinal pains (other versions have the
pain due to a sandwich or twisting himself in an unusual fashion). The
38-year-old will be operated on tomorrow, but will not survive the month,
the first ML death this century caused by an on-field injury. The stadium,
which will be renamed to honor Connie Mack in 1953, is the first concrete
and steel ballpark in major league history.

At Washington, the Yankees open the season under new manager George Stallings,
losing to the Senators, 4-1. The Nationals score three runs in the first
off journeyman Doc Newton to pave the way for Charlie Smith. Smith allows
just 4 hits and strikes out 10.

1910
The Reds extend the lease on their park for 20 years at an annual rent of
$1,500 with an option to buy at $45,000.

1911
President Taft throws out the first ball at Washington's opener, and holdout
Walter Johnson signs a 3-year contract at $7,000 a year and does not pitch
the opener. He won't miss another until 1922. Dolly Gray takes the mound
for the Nationals, winning 8-5, over Boston's Joe Wood and Ed Karger.

In front of Mayor Gaynor and a record crowd of 30,000 at the Polo Grounds,
the Phillies' Earl Moore walks 8 but shuts out the Giants, 2-0, in the season
opener. The Phils score twice in the 9th on a double by Fred Luderus. Red
Ames is the loser as Mathewson is being held out for Saturday's game. The
game takes 1 hour and 50 minutes (this game is often noted as taking just
50 minutes).

Before the start of the opener in Philadelphia, 2B Eddie Collins, the best
player on the champion A's, is presented with a new automobile. Jumbo Vaughn
and the A's Chief Bender then display tough pitching, each allowing a run
apiece through seven innings, but Jack Barry's error in the 8th allows Otis
Johnson to score the winning run for the Yankees. Vaughn allows 4 hits in
the 2-1 victory.

The Reds suffer their worst Opening Day ever, losing to the Pirates,
14-0. Babe Adams tops Art Fromme with a 4-hitter. The Bucs 17-hit attack
is led by Wagner with 3 hits, Dot Miller with 4 hits and Bobby Byrne with 5
hits, a walk and 5 RBIs. Reds reliever Jesse Tannehill, pitching his first
NL game since jumping the Pirates ship in 1902, gives up 6 hits and walks
3 in 4+ IP. The shock is so great that Tannehill retires after this game.

1912
The Tinker-Evers-Chance double play combination (with Ed Lennox at 3B)
plays its final ML game together, a 3-2 loss in Cincinnati. Vic Saier will
replace Chance at 1B.

At Philadelphia, veteran Cy Morgan pitches a superb one-hitter beating the
Senators, 3-1. The only hit is an ifield single by Moeller. Morgan strikes
out 11, including fanning the side in the 5th and the 8th.

The NL has a small box installed in the ground near home plate in each park
to supply umpires with baseballs, eliminating the possibility of home team
ballboys influencing which balls are used for each team's turn at-bat.

At Hilltop Park, the Red Sox send Buck O'Brien, 5-1 last year after leading
the Western League in strikeouts, against the Yankees' Russ Ford and the
Sox prevail, 5-2. Buck allows 6 hits as he heads towards 20 victories.

1913
A's pitcher Jack Coombs gives up 4 runs in the first and leaves after facing
5 batters. The A's beat Boston, 5-4, but Coombs will be out for the year with
an illness, subsequently diagnosed as typhoid fever, that he picked up in
spring training in Montgomery, Alabama. His weight will drop from 180 pounds
to 126. He will eventually come back to pitch two late-season games in 1914.

1916
Due to a salary dispute with Joe Lannin, the Red Sox president, Tris Speaker
is traded to the Indians for Sam Jones, Fred Thomas and approximately
$50,000. The future Hall of Famer will spend half of his Hall of Fame career
in Cleveland, compiling a .354 batting average during his 11 seasons playing
for the Tribe, after playing nine outstanding seasons in Boston.

The Giants start the season on the road with a 5-4 loss to Philadelphia
at the Baker Bowl. The game marks the debut of New York's new purple plaid
uniforms, fortunately, a trend that will only last a year.

On Opening Day the Red Sox scratch Ernie Shore as their starter and Babe
Ruth goes 8 innings for a 2-1 win over the Athletics at Boston. The A's
score their only run following Babe's throwing error, and Rube Foster gets
the last 3 outs. The Babe hands the loss to poor Jack Nabors. A poor throw
by Charlie Pick, A's 3B, is the first of his 42 errors - worst for any
20th-century 3B. This contributes to his overall .899 fielding average,
a mark that Butch Hobson would equal in 1978.

Harry Coveleski gives up just 3 hits, and collects 4 himself including a
double and triple, as the Tigers beat the White Sox, 4-0, in Chicago. Hundreds
of fans complain that their clothes are ruined by fresh green paint recently
applied to the grandstand seats.

Before 20,000 at the Polo Grounds, the Yankees and Nationals battle 11
innings before the Nats push across an unearned run against starter Ray
Caldwell to win 3-2. Walter Johnson strikes out 10 and walks none in the
win. Frank Baker, after sitting out last season in a salary protest, has
two of the five hits for New York, while Clyde Milan homers for the Nats.

In St. Louis, the Cardinals open with a 2-1 win over the Pirates Erv
Kantlehner. "Spitting Bill" Doak scatters six hits - three by Honus Wagner -
and SS Rogers Hornsby drives in both runs for St. Louis.

Phils righty "Pete" Alexander tops the Giants, 5-4. Benny Kauff, the star
acquisition from the Federal League, goes hitless for New York.

In the Opener at Cincinnati, the Cubs trounce the Reds, 7-1, behind the
pitching of George McConnell. Fred Toney takes the loss.

1917
Before a near-capacity crowd of 24,000, the visiting Cardinals beat the Reds,
5-1, behind Bill Doak.

1922
There are no playing managers in the NL for the first time since 1900. Long
considered an economic necessity, the dual role is no longer essential. It
will be 1930 before the AL has a year with all bench managers.

President Warren Harding throws out the first ball in Washington, and the
Senators beat the Yankees 6-5. Former Yank George Mogridge starts for
the Nats against Sam Jones, making his Yankee debut, as rookie manager
Clyde Milan passes over Walter Johnson as the starting pitcher. The Nats
star has been ill most of the spring. Both Ruth and Bob Meusel are out of
the Yankee lineup, suspended by the league for barnstorming, and the Babe
watches the game from the presidential box. Washington outhits New York,
15-9, and comes from behind to win in the 8th.

At Cincinnati, the Cubs' Pete Alexander stops the Reds, 7-3. Eppa Rixey
takes the loss. Alexander will rack up 70 career wins over the Reds, the
most over one team in ML history.

Giants SS Dave Bancroft handles 2 assists and 3 putouts in a 4-3 Opening Day
loss to Brooklyn. He will handle 1,046 for the year, putting him even with
Rabbit Maranville's 1914 record as the most active shortstops of any season.

In an Urban opener, the Browns Urban Shocker tops the White Sox Urban Faber,
3-2. The Sox outhit the Browns, 9-3.

1927
President Calvin Coolidge throws out the first ball in Washington before the
Red Sox win 6-2. Walter Johnson, sidelined with an injury sustained March
10th, misses his last chance to pitch an opener, after winning 9 of 14,
including 7 shutouts. Tris Speaker, playing his first game for the Senators,
is 2 for 5.

After Mayor Jimmy Walker tosses out the first ball in New York, 65,000 watch
the Yankees batter Philadelphia's Lefty Grove 8-3, the biggest Opening Day
crowd ever. After four runless innings, the Yanks score four in the 5th and
four more in the 6th. In the 6th inning Ben Paschal pinch hits for Babe Ruth
and singles against Grove, then goes out to RF. Paschal pinch hit for Gehrig
on several occasions this year. Ruth, with 2 strikeouts and a pop up in 3
at-bats against Grove, will later say he did not feel well. Waite Hoyt goes
all the way for New York, walking three and allowing eight hits, including
a 9th inning pinch single by Zack Wheat, longtime Brooklyn favorite. The
Yankees will share or hold first place from the first day of the race to
the last; a feat unmatched in the AL until the 1984 Tigers.

In Philadelphia the Giants, led by Bill Terry, open with a 15-7 pounding
of the Phillies. Terry hits the first-ever grand slam on Opening Day as he
connects off Hal Carlson in the 5th inning, while Hornsby and George Harper
also homer.

Before 42,000 in Chicago, the Cubs overwhelm the Cardinals, the defending
world champs, 10-1. Earl Webb, brought up from Louisville paces the attack
with 2 homeruns - just the 2nd player in ML history to do so - while Charley
Grimm also homers. Charley Root is the winner over Grover Cleveland Alexander.

At Cincinnati, Pittsburgh's Ray Kremer stops the Reds, 2-1. Pete Donohue
takes the loss.

1928
The Cards Grover Alexander opens his 18th season by shutting out the Pirates,
5-0, on 7 hits and beating Burleigh Grimes. It is Pete's 90th and last career
shutout, an NL record. The Cards beat the Pirates yesterday behind Jess
Haines, to open the season. Frankie Frisch homers for the 2nd straight game.

1931
Former Cubs pilot Joe McCarthy makes his debut as Yankee manager. The
future Hall of Famer, who is the team's all-time leader in managerial wins
with 1460, guides the club to eight pennants and seven World championships
during his 16-year tenure in the Bronx.

1932
At Shibe Park, bitter cold and the Depression limit the crowd to 16,000 for
the Opener with the Yankees, a 12-6 slugfest won by New York. New York racks
up five homeruns - two each by Babe Ruth and Sammy Byrd, and another by Lou
Gehrig. Gehrig adds a triple and single, as the Yankees score ten runs and
hit four homers off ace George Earnshaw. Ruth clouts a three-run homer in
the first that lands on a roof across 20th street and a two-run homer in
the 4th that travels even farther. The longest homer of the day, however,
is Jimmie Foxx' shot to center in the 7th. Jack Saltzgraver and the A's
Max Bishop each walk four times and Gehrig, with an 11-4 lead in the 9th,
steals home with Ben Chapman swiping 2B. Al Simmons answers with a two-run
homer, the 7th of the game, off Lefty Gomez. With the bases full of A's,
Red Ruffing gets the last out.

In the Opener at the Polo Grounds, the Phils chase Bill Walker in the 2nd
inning and rout the Giants, 13-5. Chuck Klein's bases-loaded triple is the
capper in the 7-run outburst. Starter Fidgety Phil Collins goes all the
way for Philadelphia and is 4 for 4 at the plate.

1933
Joe Cronin debuts as Washington manager, and the Senators Alvin Crowder wins
his 16th successive game over two seasons, 4-1, from Philadelphia. President
and Mrs. Roosevelt are two of 23,399 on hand and the president tosses out
the first ball.

The Cubs open at home and, behind Lon Warneke's 4-hit shutout, beat Dizzy
Dean and the Cardinals, 3-0.

Only 5,000 are on hand for the Browns opener, a 4-2 loss to the White
Sox. Al Simmons, in his debut for Chicago, smacks a homerun. Ed Durham is
the winning pitcher.

1935
Lou Gehrig is named as the fifth captain in Yankee history. The 33-year-old
first baseman joins Hal Chase (1912), Roger Peckinpaugh (1914-1921), Babe
Ruth (six days in 1922) and Everett Scott (1922-1925) to be so honored as
captain. (Our thanks to Howard W. Rosenberg of www.capanson.com for calling
our attention to the correct date for this entry which is commonly mistaken
for April 21.)

Tied 4-4 in the 11th, the Cubs Augie Galan hits into a triple play against
the Cards. St. Louis then scores 4 in the top of the 12th to win, 8-4. Galan
will end the year with a record - not hitting into any double plays. Paul
Derringer gets the decision over Clay Bryant.

1936
With spring training completed, the Browns are atop the Grapefruit League
standings with a 15-5 record. But only half the games are against ML
teams. Washington is 2nd at 13-7; the Yankees finish 13-8, and are 8-6
against AL teams (0 games against the NL). The Cards go 17-10, with a 9-6
record against ML squads. The Cubs are 12-11 against the ML teams.

In the Hub City series, limited to one game because of the weather, the
Boston Bees down the Red Sox, 8-4, in front of 6500 shivering fans.

the next batter for a 2-0 no-hitter.

1945
At Braves Field, the Red Sox stagger to a 12-11 win over the Braves in a
game that features 8 errors and 15 walks. Tomorrow's exhibition game is
cancelled because of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

1948
The Yanks give veteran Spud Chandler his release. Chandler won 109 games

43,640 watch at Milwaukee's County Stadium.

After a huge civic parade, the Athletics open their first season in Kansas
City with Ex-President Harry Truman throwing out the first ball. Bill
Wilson hits the first-ever homer for KC and Bob Wilson for the Tigers
answers. Alex Kellner, with relief from Ewell Blackwell, making his first
appearance since 1953, picks up the victory in the 6-2 A's win. Ned Garver
is the Tigers' loser.

With 42,269 fans in attendance, the Giants edge the Cardinals 3-1 in the
first game at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Vice President Richard Nixon
throws out the ceremonial first pitch. Sam Jones pitches a 3-hitter, and
Cardinals OF Leon Wagner hits the first HR in the $15 million stadium. In
the 3rd inning, the umpires protest that the foul poles are several inches
in fair territory, rather than on the foul lines: the Giants will make the
correction after the season.

Chuck Essegian's 11th-inning pinch-hit HR beats the Cubs, 3-2, before a
record Opening Day crowd (67,550) at Los Angeles. The HR is Essegian's
3rd straight as a pinch hitter, including 2 in the 1959 WS. Don Drysdale
pitches all the way, striking out 14, for the win over Bob Elston.

In a deal that will haunt the Indians, Frank Lane sends Norm Cash to Detroit
for 3B Steve Demeter. Cash will be Detroit's regular 1B for the next 14
years and will hit 373 HRs for them. Demeter will play 4 games for Cleveland.

1962
Pete Richert of the Dodgers, in his ML debut, fans the first 6 batters he
faces against the Reds, tying Karl Spooner's record set on September 22,
1954 (as noted by Dave Smith). This includes 4 straight swinging strikeouts
(a passed balls allows Coleman to reach 1B) in the 3rd inning. The southpaw
wins in relief of Stan Williams, lifted in the 2nd frame after allowing
4 runs. Richert sparkles, giving up no hits or walks and fanning 7 in 3
1/3 innings. Los Angeles comes back to win 11-7. While not noted, Richert
undoubtedly holds the ML record for strikeouts to start his career.

1965
At the Astrodome, the Astros lose the first regular season indoor game to
the Phillies, 2-0. Houston third baseman Bob Aspromonte, who got the first

Hector Lopez, one of eight errors the two teams combine for. Cesar Tovar's
2-out single scores the winner off Pedro Ramos.

On opening day in Chicago, the Cards hand Bob Gibson a 5-run lead in the
1st inning against Larry Jackson. But the wind is blowing out and the game
ends after 11 innings called because of darkness. The standoff is 10-10. For
the Cubs, Roberto Pena makes 3 errors in 7 chances but is 3 for 6 with a
HR and a double. Ernie Banks hits the only other HR.

1966
The first major league game played in Atlanta features Braves' hurler Tony
Cloninger pitching all thirteen innings in a losing effort to the Pirates,
3-2. 50,761 fans are on hand. Both Atlanta runs come on homers by Joe Torre,
who opened the 1965 Milwaukee Braves season with 2 homers against the Reds.

With the score tied in the 13th inning, the winning run in the Orioles'
Opening Day victory is scored as the result of a balk. With the bases
loaded and two outs, reliever Jim Lonborg balks home the deciding run in

Yankees only score is Joe Pepitone's 5th inning homer off Mickey Lolich,

run off Whitey Ford.

Ranger P Rogelio Moret announces he is going home rather than pitch. In
the locker room, the pitcher freezes in a catatonic state, his extended
arm holding a bathroom slipper. He is taken to a psychiatric facility and
will go on the disabled list for most of the season, appearing in just 6
more games. Texas loses, 3-2, to Detroit and Mark Fidrych (20). Oliver's

The Brewers' Moose Haas fans 14 Yankees in a single game, including Reggie
Jackson four times, at County Stadium.

1980

record. With the 5-2 victory at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, Kansas City
(9-0) remains undefeated since the start of the season.

At the Pirates home opener, Cardinals reliever Bruce Sutter is on the mound in
the 8th when, with Keith Hernandez playing deep behind 1B, Pirate baserunner

Cards are winners, 4-3.

1986
Making his first start in nearly 3 years, Kansas City's Dennis Leonard shuts

1987
Atlanta's Dion James gets a double the hard way when he knocks a fly ball

being sent to the Angels in two weeks for Claudell Washington.

1992
Red Sox P Matt Young does not give up a hit in hurling an 8-inning complete
game against the Indians. He loses, however, by a score of 2-1 in the
1st game of a twinbill. In the 2nd contest, Boston's Roger Clemens hurls

Barry Bonds, who signed a six-year, $43 million deal as a free agent,
the richest contract in baseball history, delights the crowd of 56,689 at
Candlestick Park by homering in his first at-bat in front of the hometown
fans. The clean-up hitter's second-inning drive to deep right field off
Mike Hammond proves to be the difference in San Francisco's 4-3 extra-inning
victory over Florida.

1994
Scott Cooper hits for the cycle going 5 for 6 and driving in five runs
helping the Red Sox to rout the Royals at Kauffman Stadium, 22-11. The
third baseman's fifth inning triple is the result of being thrown out at
the plate trying to stretch the three-bagger into an inside the park home
run. 22 runs is the most runs ever scored in a game against the Royals.

1996
Tom Urbanski pitches 5+ strong innings to win his 1st game of the year
as the Cards top the Phils, 6-1. Dennis Eckersley, with his appearance in
the 9th inning, ties Cy Young (8th place) with 906 appearances. The Cards
offense is paced by Ray Lankford with two homers.

Reds fans are again able to get out of town scores at Riverfront Stadium. In
a cost-cutting move, owner Marge Schott had canceled the score-reporting
service to save the monthly fee of $350.

1998
With their 4-1 win over the White Sox, Tampa Bay becomes the 1st expansion
team in history to have a record over .500 after their first 10 games.

Tim Salmon has a pair of homers and scores 5 runs as Anaheim downs Clevelnad,
12-1. Steve Finley goes 7+ innings for the win.

1999
The Rangers recall P Jeff Zimmerman from Oklahoma City (AAA), making them
the first team since the 1916 Chicago Cubs with three players whose last
names begin with the letter "Z." Zimmerman joins 3B Todd Zeile and C Gregg
Zaun. The 1916 Cubs roster included IFs Rollie Zeider and Heine Zimmerman
and OF Dutch Zwilling.

Joe McIlvaine, former Mets GM and currently an assistant to Minnesota GM
Terry Ryan, is arrested for public nudity on a beach.

2000
Richard Hidalgo has 3 hits, 3 RBI, 2 doubles and a HR to lead the Astros
to a 7-5 win over the Cardinals. The game is tied, 5-5, in the bottom of
the 7th, before Hidalgo gives the Astros the lead with a 2-RBI double. Jim
Edmonds ties Chick Hafey's club record by reaching base safely 12 consecutive
times. Hafey set the record in 1929.

2001
Wearing camouflage jerseys and green caps, the combat-ready Padres finally
win the battle against the Giants, after five consecutive losses to the
black and orange, 8-3. San Diego donned the uniforms to honor the area's
significant military population.

The Braves defeat the Astros, 12-4, as SS Jose Hernandez hits 2 HRs and
drives home 7 runs.

Despite pinch homers from Dellucci and Colbrunn, the Diamondbacks fall to
the Dodgers at Bank One Park, 5-4.

In Toronto, the game between the Royals and Blue Jays is postponed when
pieces from the Skydome roof start falling onto the field during batting
practice. One large piece of metal dangles for an hour before crashing down.

2002
In their first sellout since winning the World Series in 1991, the Twins
beat the toothless Tigers in the home opener, 4-2, in front of 48,244 loud
and enthusiastic fans at the Metrodome. The Minnesota franchise had been
considered for elimination due to MLB's contraction plan proposed during
the off-season.

With his 574th career round tripper, Barry Bonds passes former Twin first
baseman Harmon Killebrew and now ranks sixth on the all-time home run
list. The Giants' left fielder hit his milestone homer in the first inning
off Nelson Figueroa in the Giants' 3-2 victory over the Brewers.

2003
Fenway's Green Monster, the left field wall in the major league's smallest
park, has a new look. In place of a net used to collect homeruns that cleared
the wall, fans now sit 310 feet away and 40 feet above home plate. They
watch Red Sox right-hander Pedro Martinez give up 10 runs in 4 1/3 innings
in a 13-6 loss to the Orioles.

The Expos down the Mets, 5-4. NY 2B Roberto Alomar scores the 1,417th run
of his career to move him past Roberto Clemente into 1st place among Puerto
Rican players.

2004
At the Giants' home opener at SBC Park, the torch is passed both literally and
figuratively as Barry Bonds hit his 660th career homer to tie his godfather,
Willie Mays, for third on the all-time homer run list. The 72-year-old Hall
of Fame Mays greets his godson at home plate with a torch studded with
$18,000 worth of diamonds forming the numbers 660, 25 - Barry's number,
and 1, the number needed to move ahead.

In front of a sellout crowd of 41,626 fans, the Phillies play their first
game in their $458 million Pattison Avenue ballpark. On a cloudy day,
the Citizens Bank Park history begins with a 4-1 loss to the Reds with
right fielder Bobby Abreu hitting the park's first homer accounting
for Philadelphia's only run. A 10-foot bronze statue of Richie Ashburn
is unveiled. Zenos Frudakis' work of the five-time all-star can be found
behind centerfield in Ashburn Alley, which features the team's Walk of Fame.

Travis Hafner hits a grand slam to power the Indians to a 6-3 win over
the Twins.

Through today, there had been six pinch hit homers in the bigs in 2004 with
all coming in the ninth inning.

2005
The Twins fight back to defeat the Tigers, 5-4. Shannon Stewart's ground
rule double off Troy Percival in the bottom of the 9th plates the winning
run. It is the first run scored by the Twins off Percival in 40 innings
over the past 6 years.

2006
With a third-inning two-bagger against Bates, Wesleyan senior Jeff Maier
collects his 169th safety to break the school's record for career hits. The
22-year-old third baseman gained national notoriety a decade ago as a
young fan by leaning over the Yankee Stadium fence and deflecting Derek
Jeter's fly ball 'homer' which prevented Orioles outfielder Tony Tarasco
from catching the ball during the 1996 ALCS.

The Rangers pound the Angels, 11-3. Vladimir Guerrero singles in the 4th
inning, and has now hit safely in all 39 career games against Texas. It
is the longest streak by any player against one team since divisional play
began in 1969.

2008
The Charleston RiverDogs, a Class-A minor league affiliate of the Yankees,
commemorate the first visit of Benedict XVI to the United States with a
Pope on a Rope Night promotion. The first 1,000 fans attending the South
Atlantic League game against Rome at Joseph P. Riley Jr Park receive a soap
figurine which bores a likeness of the Holy Father.

2009
A pair of tickets for the Mets home opener at Citi Field, with a face value of
$525 apiece, are auctioned off for $7,500 on eBay. The ducats were owned by
Bernard Madoff who is in jail after pleading guilty last month to defrauding
investors, including Mets owner Fred Wilpon, in a $65 billion Ponzi scheme.

With runners taking off from first and second base, Reds' Edwin Encarnacion's
soft liner to Pirates' shortstop Jack Wilson is turned into a triple play. It
is the Bucs' first triple killing since 1993, and the team's first on the
road in 41 years.

2010
During an unusually warm spring day, the hometown Twins beat Boston, 5-2,
in the first regular-season game played at Target Field. Minnesota DH Jason
Kubel hits the ballpark's first homerun, a seventh inning shot into the
right-field seats.

Ivan Rodriguez of the Nationals records his 550th career double in the 6th
inning against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 12. "Pudge" becomes the
23rd player to reach this mark.

2022
Alyssa Nakken of the Giants became the first woman in Major League history
to coach on-field during a regular season game. She coached first base
against the San Diego Padres after Giants coach Antoan Richardson was ejected.
