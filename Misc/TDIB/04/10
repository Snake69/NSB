continue in the courts.

1906
Promising Reds' rookie John Siegle breaks a small bone directly above his
left ankle while sliding into second base in a spring training game. He won't
appear in a game until June 23 (a fruitless pinch-hitting effort, in which
he supposedly stepped up to the plate with the aid of a cane), or return
to the lineup until July 10. After limping to a .118 average in 22 games,
Siegle will disappear from the majors for good (as noted by Bill Deane).

1913
President Woodrow Wilson, who receives a gold pass from Ban Johnson, throws
out the first ball at Washington's home opener at National Park. Under new
manager Frank Chance, New York is playing its first official game as the
Yankees. New York starter George McConnell, 8-12 last year as a 35-year-old
rookie, allows just 6 hits but loses to Walter Johnson 2-1. Danny Moeller
drives in both Nat runs with a single. After giving up an unearned run in the
first, Johnson begins a string of shutout innings that will reach a record
55 2/3 before the St. Louis Browns score in the 4th on May 14th. Johnson
scatters 8 hits today, including one by 1B Charlie Sterrett. Regular first
sacker Hal Chase, though left-handed, fills in at second base for injured
player/manager Frank Chance.

1915
In the final of the city series in Philadelphia, the Phillies beat the A's,

prevail tomorrow, 2-1.

1916
The World Champion Boston Red Sox suffer an embarrassing 1-0 loss to Harvard,
finally being reduced to bunting twice in the 9th to get on base (as pointed
out by Dick Thompson). Tris Speaker, just traded, is in the stands for the
game. Tomorrow, the Red Sox will take out their loss on Boston College, 9-1.

1917
The U.S. entry into W W I and a cold, wet spring combine to put a damper
on the start of the season; 48 NL games will be postponed in the first
month. Half the ML clubs will show losses this year, and 8 of the 20 minor
leagues will fold before the season is over. The AL gets the Army to assign
drill sergeants to each team for daily pregame drills. A final contest will
be held for a $500 prize. The St. Louis Browns will take the money.

1919
Pitcher Fred Toney announces that he is retiring from baseball and will

it. Seattle's George Wisterzil sets a PCL record with 12 official plate
appearances.

1928
The Senators open a day ahead of the other teams as President Calvin Coolidge
throws out the first ball. On the mound for the Senators is Milt Gaston,

Giants and Phils.

The Cardinals send journeyman outfielder Wally Roettger to the Giants for

Cardinals by posting a .374 average for the year.

1932
The Phillies score a run in the 9th to break a 2-2 tie and beat the
Athletics, 3-2. The lowly Phils win the City Series, four games to one,
over the champion A's.

1940
In an exhibition game in Ashland, Kentucky the Yankees collect only 2
hits off Max Macon and Newt Kimball but beat the Dodgers, 7-6. The scoring
comes in the 4th on Rolfe's single, 4 walks and 2 errors, and in the 6th
on Dahlgren's solo HR. The Yanks do lose Jake Powell, who suffers a brain
concussion in a collision. Powell will play just 12 games this season.

1947
During the sixth inning of an exhibition game against their minor league team
at Ebbets Field, the Montreal Royals, Dodgers' president Branch Rickey issues
a two sentence statement to the press which will forever change the game. It

Robinson from the Montreal Royals. He will report immediately." Rickey says
after the game that he reached a definite decision just five minutes before
he made the announcement.

1948
Desperate for pitching help, the Giants sign the well-traveled Bobo Newsom,
released by the Yankees. After an 0-4 start in 11 games, New York will pass
the Buck, and he will be out of the majors until 1952.

1949
Veteran Max West of San Diego sets a PCL record as he goes 5 for 5 with 5

Carolina as his Red Sox kick the Phillies 21-1.

1959
Chicago 2B Nellie Fox gets 5 hits in 7 at-bats on Opening Day in a 14-inning
9-7 win in Detroit. His 5th hit is a 2-run homer off Don Mossi to win the
game:  Nellie went homerless last season in 623 at-bats. Nellie's 5 hits
in an opener ties a record that won't be matched in the next 40 years.

In St. Louis, the Cards lose their Opener, 6-5, to the Giants. Jackie Brandt
drives home the winner in the 9th for SF.

Phils 2B Sparky Anderson drives in the winning run in his first major league
game as Philadelphia beats the Reds, 2-1.

1961
In the last opener ever to be played at Griffith Stadium rookie president
JFK throws out the longest and hardest thrown ceremonial first pitch in
history as the ball sails over the heads of the players lined up in front
of the presidential box. The newly elected commander in chief, an avid Red
Sox fan, stays for the entire game and sees the 'new' Washington Senators,
the former team moved to Minnesota, play their first game losing to the White
Sox, 4-3. Former Sox pitcher Dick Donovan, picked up in the expansion draft,
is the loser, though he will end the season with a league-leading 2.40 ERA.

1962
At Colt Stadium in Houston before 25,271 fans, thanks to a pair of three-run
homeruns by Roman Mejias, the Colt 45's, in their first ever major league
game, defeat the Cubs, 11-2. Former Yankee hurler Bobby Shantz gets the win
for the new franchise on owner Judge Hofheinz' 50th birthday. Colt Stadium
is a temporary facility, adjacent to the land for the Astrodome.

In front of 52,564 fans, Reds infielder Eddie Kasko doubles off of Johnny
Podres in the first ever at-bat at Dodger Stadium. The home team, who played
their first four seasons on the West Coast at the LA Memorial Coliseum,
drops a 6-3 decision to Cincinnati in the debut of the new ballpark in
Chavez Ravine, the first ML arena privately financed (at $22 million)
since Yankee Stadium in 1922-23. Wally Post hits the first homer in the
new stadium, a 3-run shot over the CF fence in the 7th.

At Yankee Stadium Mantle, Maris and Skowron, the three Yankees who combined
for 143 homers last season, hit Opening Day homers to lead New York to a
come-from-behind 7-6 win over Baltimore. Moose's is a 2-run shot to dead
center that he legs out for an inside-the-park homer, while Mantle hits
his in the 8th inning to tie the game, and Maris hits a 3-run shot in the
5th. Johnny Temple, in his first game for the O's, has three hits including
a HR. Starters Billy Hoeft and Whitey Ford are gone after six innings,
and the win goes to Ralph Terry, while Hal Brown takes the loss.

1963
The Yankees follow a 8-2 opening day victory yesterday with a 5-3 victory
today at Kansas City. The 45-degree weather takes its toll as Yankee starter
Bill Stafford leaves in the 7th inning with a twinge in his right arm and
will never be quite the same. Mickey Mantle homers but pulls a muscle in his
last at-bat, that he will re-injure on the 13th sidelining him for 2 weeks.

1964
Demolition begins on the Polo Grounds to clear the way for a housing project.

1967
At D.C. Stadium, LBJ tosses out the first ball to open the season. But
the Senators manage just two hits off Mel Stottlemyre as the Yankees win,
8-0. New York jumps on starter Pete Richert for 7 runs in the 3rd inning,
collecting six straight hits, to put it away.

1968
In the Red Sox' 7-3 win at Tiger Stadium, Carl Yastrzemski homers twice on the
first day of the season, with one being an inside-the-park round-tripper. It
will take another 41 years before Emilio Bonifacio hits the next Opening
Day inside-the-park poke.

In Washington, Hubert Humphrey throws out the first ball to start the
Senators-Twins game, while soldiers patrol the streets around D.C. Stadium
to prevent rioting in the wake of the King funeral.

In New York just 15,744 show up for the opener at the Stadium between
the Yanks and California. Poet Marian Moore tosses out the first ball and
rookie catcher Frank Fernandez catches it. Fernandez then belts a home run
off George Brunet and Mel Stottlemyre wins, 1-0. Fernandez has one of three
hits off Brunet, while Stottlemyre allows just four hits. This is one of
four shutouts (out of ten games) pitched on Opening Day.

In Baltimore, the Orioles open against the Oakland Athletics with Tom Phoebus
winning over Catfish Hunter, 3-1. Hunter, at age 20, is the youngest opening
day starter ever. Reggie Jackson homers for the A's only run, while Brooks
Robinson homers for Baltimore.

1969
Tommy Agee hits a monster shot into the top tier of seats in left field
making the blast the longest homerun to reach the seats in Shea Stadium
history. A disc commemorating the Mets center fielder's historic homer is
placed in the upper deck at the Flushing ballpark.

Bill Freehan smashes two homers - one with the sacks full - to lead the
Tigers to a 12-3 win over the Indians. Mickey Lolich beats Sam McDowell.

Frank Howard bangs a pair of homers, giving him 4 in 3 games, in the Senators
9-6 win over the Yankees. Fritz Peterson gives up 10 hits and 6 runs in taking
the loss. For the Yanks, Fernandez hits a pair of homers, one a grand slam.

1970
The Cubs are down 1-0 with 2 out in the 9th to Montreal when Ron Santo
singles and Johnny Callison homers for a 2-1 win. The Cubs will lose tomorrow
then win 11 straight to take over 1st place. During the streak, however,
they will suffer the loss of Hundley when he is rammed at home by the the
Cards' Carl Taylor. Hundley will tear his knee and will be out a month,
then 2 more, until July 10, with surgery.

1971
Despite temperatures in the low 40s, a crowd of 55,352, the largest in the
history of Pennsylvania ever to watch a baseball game, witness the Phillies'

first pitch and Larry Bowa singles for the park's first hit, as Philadelphia
defeats the Expos, 4-1. Don Money connects for the park's first HR.

The Pirates drop a 5-4 decision in Atlanta despite getting 3 HRs from Willie
Stargell, including Willie's 200th career homer.

1973
A crowd of 39,464 chilly fans in 39-degree weather watch the first game at
Royals Stadium and sees the home team rout the Rangers, 12-1. The ballpark,
which will be renamed Kauffman Stadium in 1993 to honor the team's beloved
owner, is recognized as one of the most beautiful ballparks in baseball.

1975
Oakland's Mike Norris shuts out Chicago, 9-0, in his ML debut.

The Reds come from behind again to beat the Dodgers, this time spotting LA
a 5-0 lead before winning, 7-6. The Reds sweep the 3-game series.

1976
After being granted his free agency in a landmark case which will forever
change baseball, Andy Messersmith becomes one of the first major leaguers
to use his new status to sign with a team of his choice. The former Dodger
right-hander comes to terms with the Braves and will post a 16-15 record
during his two-year tenure for his new club. Messersmith had signed a
"lifetime contract" worth $1 million.

The Brewers trail 9-6 with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 9th
inning at a full County Stadium. Because of crowd noise, Yankee relief P
Dave Pagan does not hear the time-out called by 1B Chris Chambliss. Pagan
pitches to Don Money who hits a grand slam. Because of the time-out the HR
is nullified. Money bats again and hits a sacrifice fly. The final score
is 9-7 and the Brewers protest the game.

In the Opening Day 5-4 win at Pittsburgh, Dave Parker scores the winning
run in a violent collision at the plate with Phils' C Johnny Oates. Oates
will miss 2 months with a broken collar bone.

1977
At Fenway Park, the Indians (13) and the Red Sox (6) established a major
league record for the most runs scored by both teams in one inning. The
eighth inning barrage proves to be too much for Boston as Cleveland beats
the home team, 19-9. Jim Norris has 4 hits including his 1st ML HR, in the
4th inning. It is the only homer of the game.

1979
After yesterday's 10-2 Opening Day rout by the Blue Jays, White Sox owner
Bill Veeck offers free admission to fans for tomorrow's Comiskey Park
contest. The outcome will also be disappointing for the Southside fans
when the Pale Hose allow six Toronto runs to score in the top of the eighth
inning and lose the game, 9-7. In the Opening Day game Phil Huffman pitches
6 innings for the win in his ML debut.

J.R. Richard throws a ML record 6 wild pitches in the Astrodome against
the Dodgers, but strikes out 13 and wins 2-1.

1980
At Arlington Stadium's season opener, Jon Matlack and Yankee southpaw Ron
Guidry match zeroes for nine innings. In the 12th, Goose Gossage relieves
with Mickey Rivers on 3rd and Richie Zisk at the plate. His first pitch is
wild allowing Rivers to score the game's only run. Gossage also lost the
'78 Opener when Zisk took him deep in the 9th. Each team manages just 4 hits
in the contest with Bob Watson and Bob Sundberg each collecting three of them.

In front of a crowd of 53,313, Sixto Lezcano hits 2 homers - a 2-run shot
in the 4th off Dennis Eckersley and a grand slam with 2 outs in the 9th
inning - to give Milwaukee a 9-5 win over Boston and Dick Drago. Lezcano
also opened the 1978 season with a grand slam, the only player to do it
twice in Openers. The game features 7 homers, including Carl Yastrzemski
and Butch Hobson going deep in the 9th off Slaton.

The Orioles win their season opener, 5-3, over the White Sox. Jim Palmer
outpitches Steve Trout.

Minnesota outlasts Oakland, 9-7, in 12 innings. Rick Sofield hits his first ML
homer, a 3-run shot in the 12th, and Roy Smalley adds another in the frame -
both off Steve McCatty. Sofield has 3 hits and 3 runs in the game but will
end his ML career in 1981 with a .207 average. He'll switch to football and
become the starting quarterback for the University of South Carolina in 1983.

1981
On Opening Day, White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk, playing the first game of his
career while not wearing a Red Sox uniform, makes a dramatic return to Fenway
hitting a three-run homer in the eighth to knot the score at 3-3. Chicago
will tack on two more runs in the ninth and will beat Boston, 5-3.

1982
A crowd of 62,443 fans show up with the game-time temperature at 38 degrees
and a wind chill of 17 to see the Indians drop the season opener to the
Rangers, 8-3. Five hundred tons of snow had to be removed from the Municipal
Stadium field prior to the game.

The Yankees trade relief pitcher Ron Davis and minor leaguers Paul Boris
and Greg Gagne to the Twins for veteran IF Roy Smalley. Gagne hit .270 and
.297 the past two seasons at Greensboro.

Three games into the season Whitey Herzog resigns as Cardinals GM to
concentrate on managing the team. He is the last man to hold both jobs at
the same time.

1985
Cal Ripken sprains his left ankle during a pick-off play in the third inning
of a game (game 444 of the streak) against the Rangers. The 'Iron man' does
not leave the game and X-rays taken later in the day will reveal no fractures.

1989
Blue Jay's Dave Stieb pitches his third one-hitter in his past four starts
beating the Yankees, 8-0. The 30-year-old right-hander had also limited
Baltimore and Cleveland to a lone hit during his last two starts the previous
season. Jamie Quirk's 5th-inning single is the only hit off Stieb today.

Ken Griffey Jr, the youngest player in the majors, hits his first career
homer on the first pitch he ever sees at his home ballpark, the Kingdome. The
19-year-old takes White Sox' Eric King's pitch deep on his father's 39th
birthday. Seattle wins 6-5. He and his father, a reserve outfielder on the
Reds, are the first father-and-son duo to play in the major leagues at the
same time.

San Diego's Bruce Hurst pitches a one-hitter and collects his first ML hit in
a 5-2 win over the Braves. Lonnie Smith's 2-run HR in the 3rd is the only hit.

Eddie Murray hits his first NL homerun, a grand slam in the top of the 9th
inning, and leads the Dodgers to a 7-4 win over the Giants. It is Murray's
15th career grand slam.

1990
Wade Boggs is intentionally walked 3 times in Boston's 4-2 win over Detroit,
tying the ML record for a 9-inning game.

In the home opener at the SkyDome in Toronto, President George Bush, guest
of Canadian PM Brian Mulroney, becomes the 1st US president to throw out a
first pitch on foreign soil. Toronto then beats Texas, 2-1 in front of 49,673.

Rain washes out the Indians opener at home against the Yankees.

1991
Scott Sanderson hurls 8 no-hit innings against the Tigers in his first
appearance as a Yankee. He surrenders a wind-blown double to Tony Phillips
on his first pitch of the 9th and is replaced by Greg Cadaret, who finishes
the 1-hitter for a 4-0 NY victory.

Sixty-eight-year-old Minnie Minoso is denied a chance to appear in a
professional game in his 6th consecutive decade by baseball Commissioner
Fay Vincent. Minoso had been scheduled to suit up for the independent
Miami Miracles of the Class A Florida State League in their April 13 game
against the Ft. Lauderdale Yankees. Vincent refuses to allow Minoso to sign
a contract, even for a single night.

1992
San Diego's Dave Eiland becomes the 9th pitcher in history to homer in his
1st major league at-bat (his only big league homerun). He connects against Bob
Ojeda of the Dodgers in an 8-3 Padre win. Eiland enters the trivia books as he
also serves up a homer to the first batter he faces. (In 1998, as a rookie for
the Yankees, the Padres right-hander gave up a round-tripper to Paul Monitor,
who was the first batter he faced in his big league debut.) Rookie pitcher Jim
Bullinger will also homer on his 1st ML at-bat this year. The winless Eiland
will end the year on another trivia record note:  he joins Buster Narum and
Ed Hobaugh, both in 1963, as pitchers with more homers than wins in a year.

1996
In his major league debut, Cuban defector Osvaldo Fernandez allows just 5
hits and one run in 8 innings as his Giants beat the Marlins, 5-1. Fernandez
posted a fat 9.45 ERA in spring training.

1997
Florida P Alex Fernandez hurls a 1-hit, 1-0 victory over the Cubs. Fernandez
fans 8 without walking a batter, and allows just a single to Dave Hansen
with 1 out in the 9th inning.

1998
Trailing Arizona 4-2 at Qualcomm Stadium with two outs in the bottom of
the ninth, Steve Finley erases the two-run deficit with a walk-off grand
slam. The Padres' center fielder, who will accomplish the feat again in 2004,
hits the game-ending round-tripper off Felix Rodriguez.

The Dodgers' Mike Piazza becomes the 5th NL player in history to hit grand
slams in consecutive games by homering in the Dodgers 7-2 win over the
Astros. Piazza also homered with the bags full, while driving in 6 runs,
in last night's 7-2 win over Arizona. He'll hit another on April 24th to
tie the ML record for slams in a month.

Tino Martinez leads the Yankees to a historical 17-13 win over the
A's. Martinez has 3 hits, including a double and HR, 5 RBIs and 4 runs. The
teams combine for a Yankee Stadium record with 30 runs, topping the old
record of 28 set on June 3, 1933. The Yankees' 17 runs are the most in a
home opener since 1955.

Cubs' OF Henry Rodriguez gets 5 hits and drives home 3 runs in Chicago's
13-0 win over Montreal. Kevin Tapani limits the Expos to just 3 hits to
gain the win.

Down 7-2, the Red Sox jump on Seattle for 7 runs in the last half of the 9th
to defeat the Mariners, 9-7. Four Mariner relievers fail to get a single
batter out in the frame, as Mo Vaughn's grand slam off Paul Spoljaric is
the decisive hit. With the Padres' Steve Finley also hitting a game-ending
grand-slam this is the first time 2 players accomplished the feat on the
same day since 1982.

1999
The Diamondbacks defeat the Braves, 8-3, as P Randy Johnson strikes out 15
batters, including 6 in a row, to set an Arizona record. SS Tony Batista
strokes 5 hits for Arizona, including a HR, and brings home 4 runs. Batista's
streak will reach 7, then he'll have 17 at-bats without a hit.

During a rundown play, Seattle rookie IF Carlos Guillen tears a ligament
in his right knee in the Mariners 11-4 loss to Oakland. He will require
surgery and be out for the season.

2000
On his father's 50th birthday, Ken Griffey Jr becomes the youngest player
(30 years, 141 days) to hit 400 career homers beating Jimmie Foxx' previous
mark (30 years, 248 days old). Colorado Rockies beat the Cincinnati Reds, 7-5.

2002
At the Superdome in New Orleans, a crowd of 27,673 - a record for a college
baseball game - watch LSU beat Tulane, 9-5. Aaron Hill has 4 RBIs for
LSU. The previous record was 24,859 at consecutive games at the CWS in
1999 in which Miami played Alabama and Rice played Oklahoma State. The
record will last till the San Diego State-Houston matchup on March 11,
2004 at newly built Petco Park in San Diego.

2003
By hitting his 31st career leadoff homer, Astros' outfielder Craig Biggio
breaks Bobby Bonds' National League record. The major league mark of 80
belongs to Rickey Henderson. Rookie Jeriome Robertson picks up his 1st ML
win for Houston.

In a 7-6 victory over the Cardinals at Coors Field, the Rockies turn
the first triple play in club history. With Scott Rolen on second base
and Tino Martinez on first, Colorado's first baseman Todd Helton catches
Orlando Palmeiro's soft liner for the first out and throws to shortstop Jose
Hernandez who steps on second for the second out and then tags Matinez to
complete the triple killing.

The Royals down the Tigers, 4-2, sending Detroit to its 8th straight defeat
to start the season. Tigers' manager Alan Trammell becomes the 1st new
manager to begin 0-8 since Malachi Kittridge began the 1904 season at 0-13
with the Washington Senators.

2005
Atlanta's John Smoltz pitches 7+ innings striking out 15 batters but he
loses, 6-1, to the Mets. Pedro Martinez is even better, allowing 2 hits
in a complete game victory. Smoltz is just the 15th pitcher since 1960 to
strike out 15 batters and lose (according to Retrosheet).

2006
Rather than exploit the free-agent market next season, David Ortiz agrees
to a $52 million four-year contract extension with the Red Sox. The deal,
which keeps the popular designated hitter in Boston until 2010, also contains
a team option for 2011.

The Cardinals defeat the Brewers, 6-4, in the 1st game played in the new
$365 million Busch Stadium in St. Louis. The new stadium will seat 40,713
through July 12 and 46,861 after that date. Mark Mulder gets credit for
the victory and also hits a HR in the contest.

Tampa Bay loses to the Orioles, 6-3, in the Devil Ray's home opener. The
sellout crowd is just the fourth sell-out at their home park, Tropicana
Field, since they began playing there in 1998.

2007
After four days of weather-induced postponements, including blinding snow
and sub-freezing temperatures, the Cleveland Indians play their home opener
on the road, beating the Angels at Miller Park in Milwaukee, 7-6. The last
time a series was moved, the games were played at U.S. Cellular Field as
the Marlins hosted the Expos in Chicago due to Hurricane Ivan hitting Miami
in September of 2004.

2010
As a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Manny Ramirez records his 2500th
career hit with a single in the 5th inning against the Florida Marlins.
Ramirez becomes the 91st player to reach this mark.

2012
After praising Fidel Castro in a magazine interview, manager Ozzie Guillen
is suspended for five games by the Marlins. The comments of the outspoken
skipper deeply offends the large Cuban exile community living in Miami,
many of whom were victimized by the the dictator.

2013
The Red Sox sellout streak comes to an end when the less-than-capacity crowd
of 30,863 fans watch the team drop an 8-5 decision to Baltimore at Fenway
Park. The streak of 820 regular season and post season games, which began on
May 15, 2003, surpasses the Portland Trailblazers' mark of 814 consecutive
sold out contests, making the span the longest in major professional sports.

2014
Cleveland sophomore hurler Danny Salazar strikes out ten batters in 3
2/3 innings, marking the first time since 1914 that a starting pitcher
whiffed ten batters without finishing the fourth frame. The 24-year-old
Indian right-hander, who gives up five earned runs and six hits enroute to
taking the loss to the White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, gets all his outs
via the strikeout, with the exception of Adam Eaton, who is thrown out at
second base, trying to stretch a single into a double for the first out in
the third inning.

2015
At Great American Ball Park, Reds closer Aroldis Chapan throws a 101-mph
fastball by Matt Holliday to get the last out in the team's 5-4 victory
over St. Louis, making the fireballer the leader in saves by a Cuban-born
player with 115. The 27-year-old Holguin native surpasses Pinar del Rio's
Danys Baez, who, beginning in 2001, closed for six teams during his ten-year
tenure in the major leagues.

The Red Sox take six-hours 49-minutes to beat New York at Yankee Stadium,
making the contest the longest game in franchise history. The 19-inning
victory lasts 14 minutes longer to complete than a 2001 loss to the Rangers
in Texas.

Mound opponents, Cubs Travis Wood and Tyler Matzek of the Rockies, each hit
eighth in their team's lineup, marking just the 12th time in major league
history that both pitchers have not batted ninth in the same game. The last
time this occurred was in 2008 when the Cardinals, led by Tony La Russa,
who frequently employed his hurler in that slot, played the Pirates.

2018
Roberto Osuna, at the age of 23 years and 62 days, became the youngest
pitcher in Major League history to record his 100th career save. Osuna was
over a year younger than the previous record holder Francisco Rodriguez,
who had accomplished the feat at the age of 24 years and 246 days.

2021
Tim Locastro, against the Cincinnati Reds, stole second base in the sixth
inning, setting the Major League record for most successful consecutive
steals to start a career, with 28, since 1951 (the National League did not
track caught steals before 1951). He broke the record that was previously
