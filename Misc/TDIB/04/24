1901
Three rainouts give Chicago the honor of hosting the new AL's first opener. In
front of 14,000 fans at the Chicago Cricket Club, the White Sox and Roy
Patterson defeat the Cleveland Blues, 8-2, in a contest which lasted ninety
minutes. The opponent's name, which will be eventually changed to the Indians,
reflects the very bright color of the visitors' uniforms. Cleveland 2B Erve
Beck hits the first HR in AL history, off Patterson, and adds a double.

1902
Professional baseball gets its start in Durham, North Carolina as the
Tobacconists (renamed the Bulls 11 years later) play an exhibition game
against Trinity College (now Duke University). The Bulls, except for 1971-80
when minor league baseball didn't exist in the city, will continue to play
in Durham until the present day.

The Giants lose, 8-4, to Boston when RF Jim Delahanty lets a bases loaded
single skip by him and three runners score. New York scores 3 in the bottom
of the 9th, but Boston still beats Mathewson.

Brooklyn scores 5 in the 9th and wallops Philadelphia, 16-6. Willie Keeler
scores 5 runs for a ML record 6th time.

Cy Young pitches Boston to an 11-3 win over Washington. Buck Freeman has 4
hits, including 3 doubles, while Jimmy Collins and Hobe Ferris homer. Lew
Drill, a rookie from Georgetown University, drills 2 singles and a homer
in his first 3 at-bats before Young finally strikes him out.

1903
Against the Pirates, the Cardinals go into the 9th with a 7-6 lead, in
part due to three errors by SS Honus Wagner. Honus atones for the miscues
by tripling in the 9th and scoring on a Kitty Bransfield single. With 2
outs in the 11th, Wagner walks, steals 2B and scores the winner on another
Kitty single, and the Bucs win, 7-6. Wagner finishes with 2 triples among
his 4 hits, 4 RBIs and 3 stolen bases.

1905
At the Baker Bowl, Giants manager John McGraw lets Mathewson hit with two
on in the 9th, and the ace promptly singles in two runs to give the Giants
a 5-4 lead. Matty then checks the Phils in the bottom of the 9th for the
win over Bill Duggleby.

1906
Boston makes 20 hits in trouncing the Washington Nationals, 19-2.

1907
Reading, Pennsylvania - The manager of the Reading, Pennsylvania Red Roses
of the Atlantic League decided he wanted numbers on his team's uniforms so
fans would have some idea of who the players were. No one recalls that ever
having been done before. The numbers went from 1 to 15. Thirteen was skipped
thinking no one would want it on the back of their jersey. The previous
information originates with an article in old The Sporting Life newspaper of
April 27, 1907. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, numbered uniforms were
experimented with off and on for decades. The Cleveland Indians and New York
Yankees were the first teams to permanently use numbers starting with the
1929 season, though Cleveland had them only on home uniforms. Some players
weren't crazy about the idea because they thought the numbers made them
look like convicts, but the fans liked being able to tell the players with
a scorecard. By 1934, all major league teams had numbers on their uniforms.
In the early days, numbers corresponded to the player's spot in the batting
order; hence Babe Ruth was #3, Lou Gehrig was #4, etc.

1909
Sidelined much of April with the flu, Walter Johnson makes his 1st appearance
of the year. He should've stayed in bed as the Highlanders rough him up for
6 runs before he's lifted in the 3rd. Behind Joe Lake, New York rolls to a
17-0 win over Washington, a club record shutout loss for the Nationals. It'll
be tied by New York in 1920.

Let's call him Home Run. At Boston, the A's Frank Baker hits his first homer,
off Frank Arellanes, as the Athletics win, 4-1.

1911
Battle Creek of the South Michigan League makes 2 triple plays in the first
2 innings against Grand Rapids, a trick never performed in the ML.

NL President Lynch orders his umpires to stop catchers, especially Roger
Bresnahan, from verbally attacking batters.

1913
At Chicago, the Browns beat the White Sox, 3-1, using a record-tying 3
triples by 'Gloomy Gus' Williams.

At Boston, the Braves edge Brooklyn, 1-0, on a pinch single by Bill Rariden
in the 12th inning. Frank Allen, on his way to a 4-18 record, is the starter
and loser. Rookie Bill James, the top pitcher in the PCL last year, goes
the route for the win.

At Washington, the Red Sox score 4 runs in the 9th to beat the Nationals,
6-3. Boston strands one runner to Washington's 11. President Woodrow Wilson is
in the stands, his 3rd game in the 4 played in Washington this year. He leaves
in the 8th with the score 2-2 because of a meeting with Secretary Bryan.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants beat up veteran Earl Moore to score a 7-1
victory over the Phils. Tilly Shafer lines a 3-run homer in the 2nd inning
to hasten Moore's departure. Joe Evers, younger brother of Johnny, pinch
runs for Chief Meyers in the 3rd and is thrown out at 3rd during a double
steal attempt. That is the extent of Joe's ML career.

1915
Frank Allen, Pittsburgh (FL) lefty, pitches a 2-0 no-hitter against the
St. Louis Terriers. Allen will win 23 for Pittsburgh, who will finish 3rd
just a half game back of the first-place Chicago Whales and the 2nd-place
Terriers. The Terriers, in the race all the way, will outdraw the Cardinals
and Browns.

At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers beat an aging Christy Mathewson, 7-5. It's
the 6th loss in a row for the Giants.

The Phils lose their first game after 6 victories, falling to Boston,
10-2. The pitchers allowed 9 runs in the first 6 games before today.

1917
In front of 3,219 fans, Yankee lefty George Mogridge pitches a no-hitter
in Fenway Park for a 2-1 New York win. It is the 2nd of what will be an AL
record 5 no-hitters in a season. The southpaw's performance is the first
no-no in franchise history. The Yankees score on 2 walks, an error and a
sacrifice fly off Dutch Leonard. Not until Righetti's no-hitter in 1983
will another Yankee lefty toss a no-hitter.

The Reds purchase Jim Thorpe from the Giants, but return the Olympic star
to New York in August.

1918
The A's Vean Gregg shuts out the Red Sox, 3-0. George Burns' 3-run homer
off Babe Ruth in the bottom of the 8th provides all the scoring.

The Cubs win their home opener over the Cardinals, 2-0, as Hippo Vaughn
allows just one hit - a Rogers Hornsby single. Lee Meadows is the loser
for the Redbirds.

1919
Helped by a baserunning error by Redbird rookie Cliff Heathcote, the Reds top
St. Louis 3-1. Heathcote is on 1B when Hornsby smashes a long line-drive hit,
but a pantomime catch by the Reds 2B makes Heathcote hold up and Hornsby
passes him for the out.

In their home opener, the Cubs Hippo Vaughn tops the Pirates and Wilbur
Cooper, 5-1.

1920
The Yankees' Carl Mays pitches 10 innings in beating the Philadelphia
Athletics, 3-2. Mays allows 6 hits in winning his 6th straight over the
Mackmen.

According to historian David Vincent, this is the last day in major league
history that all teams played games and no homeruns were hit. The last day
of 8 games (5 AL; 3 NL) in which no homers were hit is August 8, 1923.

1921
At the Polo Grounds, Phil Douglas pitches a one-hitter to beat the Phils'
Lee Meadows, 1-0. Kelly's triple scores Frisch with the lone run. The lone
Quaker hit is a single by SS Ralph Miller.

1922
The Browns trip the Tigers, 6-2, as Ken Williams again homers, a two-run
shot off Red Oldham.

It takes 11 innings, but Carl Mays and the Yankees edge the Athletics,
6-4. It is Mays' 18th consecutive win against the A's. A 2-run homer by
Pipp off Harris decides the game.

Despite setting a team record (since 1911) for errors with 8, the Phillies
are just edged out by the Giants, 3-2. The mark will be tied in 1941.

1923
President Warren G. Harding, an avid baseball fan who likes to keep
a scorecard at games, witnesses the first shutout ever thrown at Yankee
Stadium. The chain-smoking Chief Executive is delighted to see Babe Ruth homer
during the contest, but is disappointed the Senators drop the contest, 4-0.

1925
Charlie Grimm, playing in his first series in Pittsburgh since the Cubs
acquired him, bangs out 4 hits, including 2 triples and a double, to lead
Chicago to a 7-2 win. Lefty Emil Yde is the victim of the Grimm reaper,
with Pete Alexander taking the win.

1927
In a PCL doubleheader, Portland's Elmer Smith hits a pair of homers in each
game as the Beavers sweep the Missions, 5-3 and 7-6. Smith will lead the
PCL in homers with 40.

1931
Rogers Hornsby, player/manager of the Chicago Cubs, strokes 3 consecutive
HRs and drives in 8 runs to beat the Pirates at Forbes Field, 10-6. He's
the 7th major leaguer to accomplish the feat, and the 6th in the past 8
years. He is the 2nd Cub to drive in 8 or more runs in a game:  Zimmerman
knocked in 9 in a 1911 game.

1932
In Chicago, the Cubs' Kiki Cuyler breaks a bone in his left ankle chasing
a fly ball. He'll be sidelined for seven weeks. Chicago's Charlie Root goes
on to beat Pittsburgh, 12-3.

1933
Giants' player/manager Bill Terry is hit by a pitch in a game with
the Dodgers, breaking his wrist. He will be out 3 weeks, ending his
consecutive-game streak at 468. The Giants win, 4-0, behind Carl Hubbell.

Governor Pinchot of Pennsylvania signs a bill legalizing Sunday baseball
under local option. A statewide referendum will be on the ballot in November.

1934
President Roosevelt throws out the first ball for the Washington opener,
but as with the scheduled April 16th opener, a rainstorm sends him back to
the White House in the 4th inning. The Red Sox win the game, 5-0, behind
Johnny Welch.

1937
In Boston's home opener, the Yankees tie the Sox on Tony Lazzeri's 8th inning
homer, then score a pair in the 10th on George Selkirk's triple. Twinkletoes
is out trying to swipe home. The Sox come back for a run in the 10th,
but the Yankees win, 6-5.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants win their 3rd in a row, beating the Bees,
3-0. All the scoring comes on homers - two by Mel Ott, and another by Dick
Bartell, off Johnny Lanning. Clyde Castleman extends the Giants streak of
shutout innings to 25:  the Bees have not scored in 34 innings.

1938
Goose Goslin's pinch-hit HR is the 5th of his career, for a new AL record,
but the Yankees beat the Senators 4-3.

The Giants' Hal Schumacher bests Brooklyn's Van Lingo Mungo to give New
York a 1-0 win. A leadoff scratch single by Goodie Rosen is the only hit
for the Dodgers, while the Giants' only score is a Mel Ott HR.

Pitching for the Cubs, Dizzy Dean beats the Cardinals, 5-0, limiting his
old teammates to 4 hits. It's Diz' second win for Chicago.

1940
At Philadelphia, the Yankees whip the A's, 9-4, behind Red Ruffing. Master
deceiver Frankie Crosetti pulls off at least his 6th successful hidden ball
trick (as noted by Bill Deane) when he nabs the A's Al Brancato.

1943
Pitcher Al Gerheauser makes his major league debut as the Phillies' Opening
Day pitcher, starting at Ebbets Field against the Dodgers. Brooklyn pounds
him for 7 hits and 5 runs in 4 innings on their way to an 11-4 win. Gerheauser
is the last rookie to debut as an Opening Day starter.

A spokesman for A. G. Spalding defends the baseball, saying the 11 shutouts
in the first 29 games are the result of it being "too wet and too cold. In
time the new ball will prove to be just as lively as the old one." A few
days later the company admits that the balls contain an inferior grade of
rubber cement, which has hardened. The teams agree to use up their stock of
balls left over from the 1942 season while a new supply of higher-quality
balls is made. In fact, the Dodgers today are the first team to score in
double figures this season.

1944
The Browns sweep the White Sox, winning 5-2 and 4-3, to extend their
season-opening winning streak to six games. Jack Kramer is the winner in
the opener, aiding his cause with a two-run homer.

1945
At a meeting of owners in Cleveland a list of possible successors to Judge
Landis is cut to 6:  Ford Frick, president of the NL, and 5 politicians, Jim
Farley, Carl Vinson, Robert Patterson, Bob Hannegan and Frank Lausche. Larry
MacPhail suggests adding the name of Albert "Happy" Chandler, a Kentucky
senator. The list then narrows to Chandler and Hannegan. On the first
ballot Chandler leads 11-5, short of the required three-fourths. One vote
switches over, and the owners unanimously approve the selection. Chandler,
Baseball's second commissioner, will remain in the Senate during the first
six months of his tenure in office. Also approved is the Malaney Plan for
interleague play, first brought up at the February meeting. Besides the
same-city games, Cincinnati will play at Cleveland, Brooklyn at Washington
and Detroit at Pittsburgh. The latter contest will later be scrapped when
the ODT refused to grant the Tigers permission to detour 62 miles to get
to Pittsburgh. The seven benefit games will be held on July 9 and 10.

Hitting a 9th inning HR for the 3rd time in 4 games, Butch Nieman poles a
3-run homer, giving him 5 RBIs as the Braves defeat the Dodgers, 8-6. Nieman's
3-run HR on April 20 beat the Phils, 6-5, and his 9th inning HR on the 22nd
tied the Phils.

1947
Johnny Mize of the New York Giants hits 3 successive HRs in a 14-5 loss
in Boston. It is a ML-record 5th time in his career that Mize has hit 3
HRs in one game; he will do it a 6th time with the Yankees in 1950. But
the Braves collect 22 hits, with Danny Litwhiler having a HR, triple and
2 singles in the attack. Winning hurler Johnny Sain is 2 for 4 with 3 RBI,
as he strings together a hitting streak of 17 games as a pitcher. Sain will
hit .346 this season.

The Red Sox collect just 3 hits off Frank Shea but beat the Yankees, 1-0,
on Tex Hughson's 2-hitter.

Pat Seerey hits a homer off Johnny Rigney for the game's only run as the
Indians trip the White Sox, 1-0. Don Black is the winning pitcher.

1948
The Cubs hit 4 homeruns at home in a 6-2 win over the Cards. Bill Nicholson's
HR, off Al Brazle, is to the right of the Wrigley Field scoreboard, and
lands on Sheffield Avenue. It bounces off a building and reportedly lands
on the hood of a southbound car.

1949
Lloyd Merriman of the Reds gets a HR - off Hugh Casey in the 8th - and a
triple, in his first ML at-bat, in his first ML game, a 3-2, 10 inning win
over the Pirates. Kiner's homer sends the game into overtime. In the nitecap,
Bockman's 2 homers account for all the Buc shots, as Cliff Chambers wins his
first as a Pirate, 3-1. Merriman is the second rookie to debut like this,
matching Hank Arft last year.

In the 2nd game of a PCL doubleheader against Oakland, LA's Bill Schuster
steals 2B, 3B and home in the 2nd inning. This is the second time he has
done this in a game. Oakland sweeps, winning 9-3 and 11-6.

1950
In a pitching duel with vet Ken Raffensberger, Max Lanier drives in the
only run to give the Cards a 1-0 win over the Reds.

1952
Leo Durocher charges that the umpires are ignoring the "quick pitch" rule.

Shades of Harvey Haddix. Elmer Singleton of San Francisco (PCL) pitches
a no-hitter for 12 innings against Sacramento. Singleton is touched for 3
hits in the 13th and loses, 1-0.

1953
Jackie Robinson walks twice in the 6th inning, as the Dodgers score 6 runs
enroute to a 12-4 pasting of the Giants.

1954
Giants right-hander Marv Grissom blanks the Phillies at the Polo Grounds,
1-0. Whitey Lockman's 300-foot homerun off Robin Roberts accounts for the
only score of the game.

In the 3rd inning of a 6-1 Boston win, Mickey McDermott of the Senators
fractures former teammate Boston P Mel Parnell's left forearm with a
pitch. A pinch runner for Parnell, a walk, and then a popped bunt is nabbed
by McDermott, who starts a triple play. Parnell will be out till August
1st when he returns to beat the Senators.

At Crosley Field, Wally Post belts a 2-out homerun in the 9th inning with
a man on to give the Reds a 6-5 win against the Cubs. Kiner and Sauer belt
back-to-back HRs for the Cubs in the 7th.

The White Sox spoil Vern Bickford's AL debut chasing him after 4 innings
and winning 14-4. The O's use 3 relievers including former Negro Leaguer
Jehosie "Jay" Heard, making his ML debut. Heard is the first black player
for the Orioles. He'll make just one other appearance. On September 10,
African American OF Joe Durham will make his debut as the second black Oriole.

1955
The Giants and Dodgers go at it again, this time with bats. The Giants
score 6 runs in the 10th inning to seemingly put the game away, but Brooklyn
answers with 5 runs, only to lose, 11-10. Alvin Dark scores the decisive run
in the 11th when Carl Furillo catches Thompson's fly and, thinking it made
the 3rd out, he jogs in with the ball. The 11 runs in the 10th is a NL record.

1956
AL umpire Frank Umont is the first to wear glasses in a regular season game,
between Detroit and Kansas City. The former NFL tackle (New York Giants)
still presents an intimidating appearance to most players and fans. Although
he is heckled by some A's fans as the home team loses to the Tigers, 7-4,
Umont has no problem being the second base arbitrator. Tuttle, Boone and
Bertoia rap homers. Boone and Bertoia's HRs come in the 8th inning against
Bill Bradford, pitching his only ML inning.

1957
Three Cubs pitchers walk nine players in the fifth inning of a 9-5 loss to
the Reds at Crosley Field. Moe Drabowsky starts the frame with four walks,

balls to set a new National League record. The Reds plate 7 runs in the
inning with just one hit, a two-run single by George Crowe.

with three homers and eight RBIs.

Giants veteran Hank Sauer clubs 2 homers, including a two-run shot in the
9th, to edge the Cardinals 6-5. Sauer becomes the first NL slugger to homer
in 12 parks.

1960
The Yankees score 8 runs against the Orioles before the first out is
made, tying an AL record set by Cleveland on July 6, 1954, also against
Baltimore. The Orioles respond with grand slams by Albie Pearson and Billy
Klaus in the 8th and 9th, but New York holds on for a 15-9 triumph.

Lou Berberet's first-inning grand slam off Early Wynn at Detroit is the
AL's 3rd of the day, tying the ML record for number of slams on one day in
one league. The Tigers beat the White Sox 12-4.

Jimmie Coker's slam for Philadelphia off Ted Wieand of the Reds is the
day's 4th. This ties the ML record for most slams in one day, and gives
the Phils a 9-5 win.

George Altman of the Cubs earns a "3-ball walk," as umpire Ken Burkhart
accidentally counts a balk as a ball in Chicago's game against the
Giants. With the count 0-1, Billy Loes backs Altman off the plate, but the
pitch is called a balk. The Cubs add some offense and win, 9-4, behind Don
Elston. Billy Loes loses.

1962
Dodger Sandy Koufax ties a major league mark striking out 18 batters in a
nine inning game as the Dodgers rout the Cubs, 10-2, at Wrigley Field. Indians
right-hander Bob Feller established the record whiffing 18 Tigers in 1938.

The first game in franchise history against the visiting Cardinals features
many familiar faces on the opposing team when the Colt .45's beat the
Redbirds, 4-3. Houston had been the farm club for St. Louis, and many of
their players had come through Texas on their way to the big leagues.

Reds rookie Sammy Ellis wins his first ML game, beating the Mets, 7-3. Ellis
goes 6 innings and allows just one hit, but walks 11 and is replaced by
Moe Drabowsky.

Mets manager Casey Stengel is fined $500 by Commissioner Ford Frick for
allowing his picture to appear in a beer ad.

Warren Spahn pitches Milwaukee to a 2-1 win over the Phillies. For Spahn
it is his 11th straight win over Philadelphia - breaking his own Braves
team record - stretching back to May 13, 1959.

In a South Atlantic League game at Macon, the Peaches beat Greenville,
32-5. Peaches 2B Pete Rose is 6 for 8 with a homerun, triple and 6 RBIs. Seven
Spinner pitchers walked 19 batters, as the Peaches batted around 4 times.

1964
Willie Mays paces the Giants attack hitting a HR and scoring 5 runs as the
Giants down the Reds, 15-5. Juan Marichal is the winner.

the Tigers. Richert still loses a 4-0 decision as the Tigers sweep a pair
at Washington.

Atlanta's 5-2 win at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in the first game of a
doubleheader is an NL-record 18th straight home win against the Mets. "Home"
for 17 of those wins was Milwaukee.

1969
After belting homers his first 2 at-bats, Reggie Jackson is decked twice
by pitches from Woodsen and charges the mound. Reggie gets tossed but the
A's win, 6-4, over the Twins.

prevails 6-5 in the 12th frame.

1979
Substitute umpires consult 28 minutes over a decision, change their minds
twice, and finally issue a compromise decision. Both the Mets and the Giants
play the game under protest; the Mets win 10-3.

1982
Jesse Barfield becomes the first Blue Jay in franchise history to pinch-hit
a grand slam when he goes deep off Tom Burgmeier in the 8th inning. The
right-fielder's bases-loaded heroics isn't enough to stave of an eventual
8-7 Toronto loss to Boston at Exhibition Stadium. Yastrzemski has a 3-run
HR in the 5th off Dave Stieb.

The Cardinals win their 12th game in a row, 7-4, over the Phillies. St. Louis
will finally lose tomorrow, 8-4, to Philadelphia, as Steve Carlton wins
his first game of the season after 4 straight defeats.

1984
The Tigers score 3 runs in the 9th inning to come from behind and beat the
Twins, 6-5. Lou Whitaker's 2-out single drives home the winner. The rally
gives Jack Morris (4-0) his 11th straight win over Minnesota going back to
June 1981.

1985
Pete Vuckovich records his first win for Milwaukee since his Cy Young Award
winning season of 1982, pitching 7 innings of the Brewers 3-2 win over
Chicago. He had been sidelined most of the past 2 seasons with shoulder
problems.

1987
At Cleveland Stadium, Rickey Henderson becomes the first player in baseball
history to hit a homerun off two different 300-game winners in the same
game. The left fielder's solo homer in the 8th inning off Phil Niekro and
his two-run blast in the ninth off Steve Carlton help the Yankees edge the
Indians, 6-5.

1989
Joining Reggie Jackson and the Reggie bar, Ken Griffey Jr becomes the
second player in history to have a candy bar named after him when he signs
a contract with Pacific Trading Cards Company. Unfortunately, the Mariners'
center fielder can't enjoy the popular confectionary, more than one million
will be sold, because the 19-year-old rookie is allergic to chocolate.

1991
Houston rookie P Darryl Kile hurls 6 hitless innings against Cincinnati in
his 1st big league start. Manager Art Howe removes him with the no-hitter
intact rather than risk an injury to his arm. The Reds finally manage a
single off Curt Schilling in the 9th as Houston wins, 1-0.

1992
Former 14-year major leaguer Derrel Thomas is arrested on drug charges in
Los Angeles.

Former Yankees vice president Leonard Kleinman drops his $30 million lawsuit

host Tigers 24-11, the highest score rung up on Detroit since their loss in
1912 when the team boycotted over the suspension of Ty Cobb and a sub team
was hastily cobbled together. Greg Myers and Paul Molitor each drive in 5
runs, and Molitor scores 5 runs, as Minnesota scores against all 7 Tiger
pitchers they face. The 35 runs is the most today as major league teams
total 195 runs, the most this century. The average game total of 13.9 runs
tops the record of 13.6 set on July 12, 1931.

Reggie Jefferson's 3rd double of the game breaks a 7th-inning tie as Boston
edges the Rangers 11-9. Texas is led by unlikely slugger Kevin Elster,

which leads Los Angeles to a 12-4 victory over the visiting Cubs.

Hitting a solo homer off Giants' right-hander Orel Hershiser at 3Com Park,
Geoff Jenkins becomes the first Brewer player ever to homer in his first
major league game. The rookie joins Chuck Tanner, who accomplished the
feat in 1955 as a member of the Braves, as the only players in Milwaukee
baseball history to homer in their first game.

Yankee Stadium is cleared to reopen, so a series that was originally scheduled
to be in Detroit opens in New York. Darryl Strawberry homers to complete a
4-run rally in the 1st in the Yankees 8-4 win. David Cone earns the win, his
150th, over Greg Keagle. It is also Cone's 11th consecutive win over Detroit.

Moises Alou drives in 5 runs and Carl Everett homers from each side of the
plate - the 7th time an Astro has accomplished this - to lead the Astros
to an 8-4 win over Montreal.

John Burkett lasts just 4 2/3 innings but gives up 11 earned runs - 8 in
the 2nd - to set a Rangers club record for earned runs allowed.
