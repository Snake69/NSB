5-2 in the AL opener in the nation's capital. Joe McGinnity is the loser
to Bill Carrick.

At Philadelphia, the Athletics beat the Boston Americans, 8-5, behind Nap
Lajoie's continued hot hitting. Nap has 2 singles and 2 triples to run his

8-5 loss to Washington.

1902
Brickyard Kennedy, a member of the Brooklyn Superbas for 10 years, makes
his first start as a New York Giant and shuts out his old team, 6-0, on 4
hits. Two of the hits are by Sheckard, now in LF. It will be Brickyard's only
win of the year and his only win as a Giant. The loser is John McMakin. The
Giants also announce the release of Jim Delahanty, who hit .231 in 7
games. He'll reappear in the majors in 1904 and play another 11 years.

Highlanders and Philadelphia A's play a benefit game for the victims of the
San Francisco earthquake, raising $5,600. The 2 teams also work out a deal

by May 2, all PCL teams will be in action.

1908
The Braves rally to tie the Giants in the 5th, then score runs in the 10th
and 11th to beat Malarkey, 7-6. Winning pitcher Irv Young scores the winning

on the train. In Chicago, the Cincy squad borrows White Sox uniforms and
then loses to the Cubs 7-2, at the West Side Grounds.

At Ebbets Field, New York's Christy Mathewson beats Nap Rucker 6-0 in 13
innings and gives up no walks. He has thrown 22 innings without a pass;
he will not walk a batter for 47 innings, then will top his own record
later in the year. During his 25-11 season, Matty will walk 21 and hit none.

1915
Federal League star Benny Kauff jumps from the Brookfeds to the New York
Giants. When Boston refuses to play if Kauff is in the Giants' lineup, ump
Ernie Quigley forfeits the game to New York. The two teams agree to play
an exhibition game. The other ump, Mal Eason, telephones NL president John
Tener, who declares Kauff ineligible until reinstated and orders Eason to
forfeit the game to Boston. Meanwhile, the Braves win the exhibition game,
13-8. The next day Tener rules this to be an official game, and both forfeits
are canceled. Kauff goes back to Brooklyn where he leads the FL at .342,
and McGraw has to wait until next year to sign him.

singles. The big winner, however, is New York's Fred Merkle who wins an
automobile when his double in the 8th hits an advertising sign on the left
field wall. The sign, which has been in place since opening day 1915, says
that the first player to hit the sign wins an automobile from the company.

1918
With Eddie Collins on 2B and Joe Jackson at 1B, center fielder Tris Speaker
turns the 6th unassisted double play of his career, and his 2nd of the
month. But Cleveland still loses 8-4 to the White Sox. The 2 unassisted
DPs is an AL season record. Speaker will erroneously be listed in the 1927
TSN Record book as completing 2 unassisted DPs in each of two games this
month, and that error, plus the later discovery of 2 additional (earlier)
unassisted Speaker DPs, will cause confusion. For the record, Speaker's
unassisted double plays were:  June 6, 1909, April 23, 1910, April 21,
1914, August 8, 1914 and the two this month. Speaker's mark is a ML record.

Boston rolls past Washington, 8-1. Babe Ruth allows 5 hits and is 2 for 2
at the plate, both doubles, plus a stolen base.

In Cincinnati, the Reds top the Cardinals, 4-3, in a game that the Cards
protest. St. Louis says that Roush, who is 2 for 3 in the game, deliberately
juggled a fly ball causing a base runner to leave too soon. The protest
will be upheld and the records expunged. The Cards will be involved in
another protested game on June 3 with both contests having a bearing on
the batting title.

1922
The NY Giants collect 20 hits, including 4 inside-the-park HRs, in windswept
Braves Field in Boston. George Kelly hits 2, one in the 4th and another in

the cycle in his 5 hits and scores 5 runs. Phil Douglas coasts to a 15-4 win.

Cy Williams clouts homers #8 and #9, off Stan Coveleski, to lead the Browns
to a 6-5 win over the Indians.

11th off Pittsburgh's Specs Meadows.

1926

1930
Suspicions that the 1930 ball is the liveliest ever increase as 123 runs
are scored in 7 ML games (for an average per game of more than 17 runs). The
biggest score is the Robins 19-15 win over the Giants as the 2 teams combine
for 41 hits. Flowers and Lopez lead the Brooklyn attack with 4 hits apiece.

1931
Wes Ferrell pitches the AL's first no-hitter in 5 years, a 9-0 win for
Cleveland against the St. Louis Browns. His brother, Rick, almost gets a hit

strikes out 8 and bats in 4 runs with a HR, off Sam Gray, and a double.

1932
Chuck Klein leads the Phils to a 13-6 win over the Dodgers. Klein is 4 for
4 with 6 RBIs. Renge is the CG winner.

Two days after swapping P Bump Hadley and OF Bruce Campbell for the Brown's
Red Kress, the White Sox conclude another deal. Chicago sends outfielders
Smead Jolley and Johnny Watwood, plus C Bennie Tate to the Red Sox for C
Charlie Berry. Berry will have 2 solid years in Chicago, but will make his
mark as an ML umpire and NFL referee.

1933
Washington C Luke Sewell makes a rare double play with no outs in the 9th,
tagging out first Lou Gehrig, who held up at 2B to see if a Tony Lazzeri
fly ball would be caught, and then Dixie Walker attempting to score from
1B. Lazzeri's hit is a double but Cronin's relay from Goose Goslin allows
Sewell to tag the two in succession. The Senators beat the Yankees, 6-3.

1934
With Pennsylvania's Blue Law repealed, Pittsburgh becomes the last ML
city to play a home game on a Sunday. Benny Frey gets the victory when the
Pirates beat Cincinnati at Forbes Field, 9-5. Meanwhile, the Phils lose to

in a 17-inning duel. The game is scoreless until the 12th when the Giants
score a run, but the Cards match it in the bottom of the 12th. Parmelee
allows just 6 hits in 17 innings, while King Carl gives up 11.

Tiger first sacker Hank Greenberg breaks his left wrist in a baseline
collision with Washington's Jake Powell and is finished for the season. It
will be suggested that Powell's anti-Semitism is behind the crash. This
is the same wrist that Greenberg broke in the 2nd game of the 1935 WS. The
Tigers lose, 7-3, to Pete Appleton as they collect just 2 hits, one a 9th
inning HR by Al Simmons.

Daitokyo by a score of 8-5.

1938
Bob Ray, in his column in the LA Times, says that Phillie player-manager
Jimmie Wilson has hung up his "tools of ignorance" and will just be a bench
manager. In fact, Wilson will catch a few games over the next 3 years,
finishing with 6 for the Reds in the 1940 World Series. This is one of the
earliest uses of the term for catcher's equipment. J.G. Taylor Spink's column
of April 1, 1937, said that was the term Bill Dickey used in referring to
his catching gear. On August 8, 1940, The Sporting News will state that
Jimmie Foxx was donning the 'tools of ignorance' for the Bosox.

To the delight of the first Ladies Day crowd ever at Yankee Stadium (according
to reports 4903 women attended) the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox,

1939
On a chilly Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium, Lou Gehrig comes to the
plate in the fourth inning and singles off Washington hurler Ken Chase
for his 2,721st and last hit, the most ever in franchise history. The
"Iron Horse's" record will stand for over 70 years until Derek Jeter,
another 35-year-old team captain, surpasses the mark in 2009. In this,
the 7th game of the season, Joe DiMaggio makes a sharp turn while fielding
a liner, and tears muscles in his right foot. The Yankees lose the game,
7-3, and DiMaggio will miss the next 35 games.

1940
At Detroit, Bob Feller walks in the winning run in the 8th inning and
loses to the Tigers, 4-3. Cotton Pippen is the winner with 8 1/3 innings
of relief. The Indians (7-3) are now tied with the Red Sox for 1st place.

1941
At their stockholders meeting, the new owners of the Boston Nationals abandon
the Bees nickname in favor of the Braves. Bob Quinn, retained as president,
instituted the name change in January, 1936, by appealing to the public
for suggestions.

1943
Connie Ryan, a New York Giant two days earlier, cracks a 9th inning homer
against his now former teammate Van Lingle Mungo to give the Braves a 5-2
win. New Giant Ernie Lombardi pinch hits and K's with the tying run on base
in the 9th.

1944

The Browns take a pair from the White Sox, winning 3-2 and 11-4. They break
open game 2 with 3 runs in the 7th off reliever Clay Touchstone, who last
pitched in the majors in 1928 and 1929 for the Braves.

The Yankees split a pair with the Senators, losing the nitecap, 2-1, after
winning the lidlifter, 13-4. Russ Derry hits a pair of homers - including
his 2nd grand slam of the season - in the opener, and has Joe McCarthy
wondering if he has another Ruth.

Between games of a doubleheader, the Tigers swap OF/3B Don Ross and 2B Dutch
Meyer, signed 9 days ago, to the Indians for Roy Cullenbine, one of the
Detroit players freed by Judge Landis in 1940. Landis had specified that none
of the new free agents could play for the Tigers for three years. Cleveland
wins the opener, 4-0, while Detroit takes the nitecap by the same score.

last year's National League batting champ in the Phillies lineup.

Cards relief pitcher Ted Wilks bows 5-4 in 14 innings to the Cincinnati Reds

a 21-9 romp over the host Philadelphia A's. Al Rosen chips in with 3 HRs and
7 RBI as both teams total 43 hits, 2 hits short of the AL mark. The Indian
outfield collects 12 hits to tie the AL record, last tied in 1917. The
Indians had been shut out in 3 out of their past 4 games, and held to a
single hit in 2 of them.

The White Sox sweep a pair at Washington, winning 7-4 and 4-3 in 11
innings. In the nitecap, Bobo Newsom, making his 2nd appearance, loses his
first in relief. Bobo was signed before the season for a record 5th tour of
duty with the Nationals. He'll even his record, then be waived to the Browns.

1953
Little-Bigger League changes its name to the Babe Ruth League.

Joe Adcock becomes the first ML player to homer into the CF bleacher seats in
the Polo Grounds, over 475 feet away. His homer in the 3rd, with Pafko on,
comes off a Jim Hearn fast ball. Luke Easter, in a 1948 Negro League game,
and Schoolboy Rowe, in batting practice before a 1933 exhibition game, also
accomplished the feat. Lou Brock and Hank Aaron will match it is as well in
1962. The Braves win the game 3-2 on a 9th-inning knuckler by Hoyt Wilhelm
that eludes Sal Yvars for a wild pitch. Billy Bruton's perfect throw cuts
down Monte Irvin for the final out. After the game, manager Charlie Grimm
buys Adcock's homer for $25 from the fan who caught it.

the afternoon. The Reds sweep all 4 games with Chicago.

In an exhibition game at Jersey City, the Indians nip the Dodgers, 1-0,

players to accomplish the feat without the benefit of a 30-homerun season.

At Boston, CF Shane Mack is the only outfielder not to throw out a runner. All
three California outfielders - Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and Orlando
Palmeiro - do it, while Red Sox starting LF Wil Cordero and Troy O'Leary,
who replaced Rudy Pemberton in RF, register one. The Angels win the contest by
a score of 5-4. Tomorrow, Anderson and Cordero will throw out runners again.

The jokes have stopped. The Cubs win their 4th in 5 games beating the Expos,
14-8. Brooks Kieschnick, recalled on April 11, tallies 6 RBIs on 2 homers
and a single to lead the Cubs back from a 5-0 deficit. Steve Trachsel picks
up his first win despite giving up 7 runs in 5 innings.

1998
Oakland rookie OF Ben Grieve gets 5 hits in the Athletics' 11-4 win over
Cleveland. He scores 4 runs in the contest while knocking in a pair.

Led by Wil Cordero and Albert Belle, the White Sox pound on the Orioles,
16-7, ruining Sidey Ponson's 1st ML start. Cordero, cut by Boston on the
last day of spring training, has 2 HRs and 5 RBIs, and Belle has 2 HRs and
4 RBIs. Belle follows a Thomas HR with his 1st dinger, and Ventura follows
Belle's 2nd with another. Thomas adds a big hurt, breaking reliever Norm
Charlton's nose with a line single in the 7th.

1999
Japanese hurler Hideo Nomo signs as a free agent with the Brewers. The
'Tornado' will have a comeback season with Milwaukee posting a 12-8 record
in 28 starts.

Down 6-1, the Mariners score 11 runs in the 5th inning and 6 more in the
6th on the way to a 22-6 pasting of Detroit and a team record for runs
scored. Ken Griffey Jr hits 2 HRs (one a grand salami) and drives in 6 in the
5th inning. Tiger P Mel Rojas is pounded for 8 hits and 11 earned runs in 1
2/3 innings of relief. It is the first time in 40 years that Detroit has given
up 11 runs in a frame. By not committing an error in the contest, Mariner 1B
David Segui becomes baseball's all-time leader in fielding percentage among
first basemen (1,000 games minimum), moving slightly ahead of Steve Garvey.

It is a day for one-sided scoring as the Angels also win by 16 runs, 17-1
over Toronto. Blue Jay rookie starter Roy Halladay enters the game with
no earned runs in 20 innings, but the Angels score 7 in the 1st to end
that. Andy Sheets has 5 RBIs in the game.

The Devil Rays defeat the White Sox, 4-1. Tampa Bay 1B Fred McGriff homers
in the contest at Comiskey Park, tying the record held by Ellis Burks and
Gary Gaetti for hitting HRs in 33 different major league parks.

Phillies P Jeff Brantley goes on the DL, facing surgery to repair a torn
labrum in his shoulder. He will be out the rest of the season.

2000
The Pirates and Reds combine to tie a major league record in Cincinnati's
6-5 victory by hitting a total of five sacrifice flies.

For the first time in seven tries, the Giants win at Pacific Bell Park
as San Francisco becomes the first franchise to lose six games to start a
season in a newly constructed ballpark. Barry Bonds' eighth inning homerun
proves to be the difference in a 2-1 victory over the Expos.

2001
The Brewers whitewash the Expos, 10-0, as Geoff Jenkins gets 4 hits,
including 2 HRs, and drives home 6 runs for the 2nd straight game. His 5
HRs in 2 games ties the ML mark.

Cubs starter Julian Tavarez apologizes to fans after making derogatory remarks
toward San Francisco fans the previous day. He is later fined by the club.

2002
Brian Sprout, a Division III All-American, becomes the first and only player
in the recorded history of the national pastime to hit for the homerun
cycle in order. The St. Olaf College Ole hits a solo shot, a two-run homer,
a three-run homer and a grand slam in four consecutive at-bats during a
39-4 rout of Augsburg.

Former ML OF Darryl Strawberry is sentenced to 18 months in prison for
violating the terms of his probation six times.

2003
It shoulda been the Royals. Gene Kingsale misses a game in order to be
knighted in his home country of Aruba. Kingsale was joined by Baltimore
pitcher Sidney Ponson and Los Angeles pitcher Calvin Maduro. Sir Eugene
will be back in the lineup tomorrow.

2004
At Indianapolis' Victory Field, the International League's contest between
the hometown Indians and Louisville Bats is delayed for twenty minutes
before the start of the fourth inning as a maintenance crew works to free
first baseman Jeff Liefer from a dugout bathroom. Returning to the field,
the first baseman is greeted with standing ovation and receives a gift from
the opposing dugout, a roll of toilet paper.

The Cardinals beat the Phillies, 5-4, in 13 innings. The win makes St. Louis
manager Tony LaRussa only the 2nd manager in history (along with Sparky
Anderson) to win 700 games with 2 different teams.

The Giants lose to the Marlins, 4-3, despite Barry Bonds' 668th career
homerun. The blast gives the slugger and his late father, Bobby, a total
of 1,000 career round-trippers.

2005
The Nationals exercise Jose Guillen's $4 million contract option for 2006. The
sometimes angry 28-year-old outfielder, who was acquired in a trade with
the Angels after feuding with manager Mike Soccia, appears to have found
a home in Washington thanks to a very pleased general manager, Jim Bowden.

Although Eric Gagne is on the disabled list and hasn't thrown a pitch this
season, he is suspended for two games and fined. The action is taken because
after being ejected on April 6 for heckling home plate umpire Bill Hohn,
MLB warned the Dodgers closer he was in violation of rule 3.17, which states
players on the disabled list may not take part in any activity during the
game. The former Cy Young winner continued to dress and participate in
game activities.

Skippers Lou Piniella (1 game) and Terry Francona (1 game) are included as
part of the six members of the Red Sox and Devil Rays who are suspended for
their roles in the two bench-clearing incidents during the bean ball contest
played on April 24th in Tampa Bay. Boston's 11-3 victory, which featured
six ejections, also results in multi-game suspensions for Bronson Arroyo
(6 games), Dewon Brazelton (5 games), Lance Carter (5 games) and Trot Nixon
(2 games).

In a match-up of 300-game winners, Greg Maddux bests Roger Clemens for his
306th career victory as the Cubs edge the Astros at Minute Maid Park, 3-2,
even though The Rocket has two hits off him. The last such showdown occurred
in 1987 when Angels' hurler Don Sutton of California defeated Twins southpaw
Steve Carlton.

2006
The Cardinals' Albert Pujols sets a new ML record by hitting his 14th HR
for the month of April as St. Louis edges Washington, 2-1.

In a 17-6 win over Toronto, the Yankees became the 15th team to score in every
inning in which they batted (excluding rain shortened games). It was the
2nd time in team history (1939) the Bombers scored in every frame matching
the Cleveland Spiders as the only team to score a run in every inning of a
full-length game twice in franchise history. The Spiders accomplished the feat
in 1889 and 1894. Yankee 1B Jason Giambi has a homer and 4 RBIs and reaches
base 4 times, while Johnny Damon scores 5 runs. Reed Johnson gets hit by
pitches three times for the Jays. He joins Damion Easley as the only players
since 1957 to be hit by a pitch three times in a game twice in their careers.

The Tigers pound out 23 hits as they maul the Twins, 18-1. Justin Verlander
is the easy winner as batterymate Pudge Rodriguez has 4 hits and Carlos
Guillen has 2 homers and 5 RBIs.

Kansas City's Reggie Sanders hits a first inning grand slam off Esteban
Loaiza of Oakland but loses it when the game is rained out in the 3rd inning.

2007
Cardinals reliever Josh Hancock dies on impact in an early morning automobile
accident as his 2007 Ford Explorer slams into a parked tow truck in the
westbound lane of Highway 40 in St. Louis. In respect to the well-liked
29-year-old, tonight's nationally televised game scheduled against the Cubs
is postponed.

Trevor Hoffman appears as a pitcher in his 803rd game for the Padres
establishing a new record for games pitched for any one team. The previous
mark was shared by both Walter Johnson (Senators, 1907-27) and Elroy Face
(Pirates, 1953-68).

At Coors Field during a 9-7 Colorado victory over the Braves, Troy Tulowitzki
turns the 13th unassisted triple play in big league history. With the
base runners on first and second on the move in the top of the seventh,
Rockies shortstop Tulowitzki catches Chipper Jones' line drive (1), steps
on second to retire Kelly Johnson (2) and then tags Edgar Renteria (3)
returning to first base.

2008
At the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Brandon Boggs becomes the first player
to start his career with a hit from each side of the plate. Entering the 9-5
loss to the Royals in the bottom of fifth, the 25-year-old switch-hitting
rookie singles to left field off Ron Mahay as a right-handed batter and
then two innings later singles to center field off Ramon Ramirez batting
as a lefty.

2009
In Kansas City's 11-3 victory over Toronto at Kauffman Stadium, Vernon
Wells' first inning two-out RBI single ends Zack Greinke's streak of not
allowing an earned run at 43 consecutive innings. The Royals right-hander,
who improves his record to 5-0, had not given up an earned run in his last
six starts, dating back to September 13th of last season.

With a double off Philadelphia's Brett Meyers, Ryan Zimmerman breaks his
own Nationals team record by extending his hitting streak to 18 games. The
Washington third baseman established the previous mark of 17 in 2006.

2010
Roy Halladay loses his third consecutive complete game, a 1-0 defeat at
Boston's Fenway Park. The hard-luck Blue Jays right-hander is the first
pitcher to suffer such an indignity since Randy Johnson lost three straight
complete games decisions in 1999, and becomes the first Toronto hurler
since Jim Clancy had a similar streak in 1982.

During the Diamondbacks game against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, scores
of protesters wave signs and chant, "Boycott Arizona! Boycott Arizona!"
on the sidewalk outside the ballpark. The demonstration is in response
to the state's recently enacted illegal-immigration law, with organizers
hoping the movement will inspire baseball fans to stay away from contests
that features the team from The Grand Canyon State.

Detroit's Magglio Ordonez records his 2000th career hit with a single in
the 4th inning against the Minnesota Twins. He becomes the 260th player to
reach this mark.

2013
Donald Lutz, who left the U.S. as an infant, becomes the first
German-developed player to appear in the major leagues when he grounds out
to second as a pinch-hitter in the Reds' 2-1 victory over St. Louis at Busch
Stadium. The 24-year-old outfielder, a member of the German National Team
that competed in the 2013 WBC, joins Seattle's Alex Liddi as the second
graduate of the Major League Baseball International European Academy to
make a big league team.

Brandon Moss' walk-off two-run homer in the 19th inning ends a six-hour
32-minute contest, the longest game by time in A's history. Oakland's 10-8
victory over Los Angeles features 5 1/3 innings of outstanding relief by
Brett Anderson, who enters the game in the 13th frame after being scratched
from his scheduled start to rest a sore right ankle.

2015
In a game that is closed to the public due to the civil unrest in Baltimore,
resulting from the death of Freddie Gray, the Orioles beat the White Sox
in an afternoon contest at a completely empty Camden Yards, 8-2. The first
two games of this series were postponed and the scheduled weekend series
against the Tampa Bay Rays is being shifted to St. Petersburg, Florida in
an effort to save the much-needed law enforcement resources for the affected
neighborhoods in the Charm City.

2016
In his 16th career start, Marlins left-hander Adam Conley is four outs away
from a no-hitter when he is replaced by reliever Jose Urena, who gives up
the Brewers' first hit with one out in the ninth in the team’s 6-3 victory
at Milwaukee’s Miller Park. Miami manager Don Mattingly made the decision
to go to the bullpen after the 25-year-old southpaw needed 16 pitches to get
the first two outs of the eighth inning, bringing his total pitch count 116,
ten more than the southpaw’s previous career high.

2019
By collecting his 37th RBI, against the San Francisco Giants, Cody Bellinger
set the Major League record with the most RBI by May 1. He broke the record
that was held by Mark McGwire and Juan Gonzalez, who both set the record
in 1998.

2022
Tylor Megill, Drew Smith, Joely Rodríguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin Diaz (all
of the Mets) combined to throw the second no-hitter in franchise history
by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0. It was accomplished with 12
strikeouts and six walks on 159 total pitches. Megill pitched the first
five innings. It is the 17th combined no-hitter in league history. This
was also the 20th time that the Phillies have been no-hit in their history,
which ties them with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the most times being no-hit
of any franchise, which includes the postseason.
