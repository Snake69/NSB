1903
The Reds open the season before 12,000 fans and lose to the Pirates, 7-1,
the first of four straight losses to the Bucs. Deacon Phillippe allows just
2 Cincy hits for the win.

1904
St. Louis Nationals player-manager Kid Nichols, out of the major leagues
for 2 years, celebrates his return by pitching his team to a 7-5 win over
the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates. The Kid will win 21 games this year as
the Cards finish 5th.

1906
In Cincinnati, the Cubs lose 3-2 as Johnny Evers and Frank Chance get
ejected. Following the game, Joe Tinker gets into a fight with a fan to
complete the circuit.

Phillies pitcher John Lush records a double-double, walking 10 batters and
striking out 11 in beating the Giants, 4-2.

1908
Pittsburgh's Sam Leever tosses a 3-hit shutout over the Cardinals as
Pittsburgh sweeps the 3-game series. But the big news for the Pirates is
the signing of Honus Wagner for another year. The star SS ends his holdout
and will play on the 19th in a 4-3 loss to the Reds.

1910
In Boston, Christy Mathewson whips the Doves, striking out 9 for a 3-1
win. Matty adds to the offense with a 6th inning homer over the LF fence
off Kirby White.

1912
The host Cardinals trounce the Cubs, 20-5, as 9 Redbirds score 2 or more
runs. Rube Ellis has a grand slam for the Birds. The scoring record will
be tied in 1922.

The Pirates top the Reds, 8-2, and pull off a 5-3-7 double play along the
way. Left fielder Max Carey makes the putout at 2B.

The Tigers pull a triple steal against the White Sox as they win, 10-1.

1915
The Dodgers recover from yesterday's loss to beat the Giants, 5-3.

1916
Now with Cleveland, Boston's Tris Speaker doubles against the Tigers' Hooks
Dauss, the first of 41 that will tie him with teammate Jack Graney for the AL
lead, and one of an all-time career high of 792. The Indians top Detroit, 4-3.

1918
The Reds' Pete Schneider, in a season opener, and the Red Sox' Carl Mays
each pitch one-hitters. Red Sox submariner Mays loses his no-hitter in the
8th on Dugan's ground single stopped by 2B Dave Shean, but beats the A's,
1-0. Everett Scott drives home the winner in the bottom of the 9th off Scott
Perry. The Reds top the Pirates' Wilber Cooper, 2-0, with Casey Stengel's
single the lone Buc shot.

In St, Louis, the Cardinals get 9 hits against Grover Cleveland Alexander
and beat the Cubs, 4-2, behind Lee "Specs" Meadows.

The Giants open before a crowd of 28,000 at the Polo Grounds, beating
Brooklyn, 6-4. Rube Marquard gives up 4 hits in a third of an inning as
the Giants score three runs in the first.

Washington reliever George Dumont lines an 8th inning double to tie the
game and the Senators tally four runs to beat the Yankees, 7-5.

1921
The A's Rube Waddell coasts to a 12-2 win over Washington as the A's amass
20 hits off Happy Townsend. Happy is on his way to a not-so-happy 5-26 season.

1926
In the home opener for Cincinnati, Red Lucas beats Chicago's Grover Alexander,
2-1, in a brisk one hour and 15 minutes. The good-hitting Lucas also bangs
a triple to help the Cincy offense.

1928
For the first time, a pitcher is deprived of his mitt when the Brooklyn
captain Max Carey complains and the ump removes Boston's Charlie Robertson's
glove. The New York Times reports, "The Robins detected Robertson doing
odd stunts with the ball with the aid of his glove. They reported it to
umpire Moran who made Robertson change his glove." Robertson still wins,
3-2, as Hornsby has 3 of Boston's 12 hits.

Phils veteran Cy Williams greets reliever Fred Fitzsimmons with a three-run
homer to send the Phils home a 7-5 winner at the Polo Grounds. Cy's blow
negates a single, double and triple by Bill Terry for the Giants, now 3-1.

In Cleveland, Indians owner Alva Bradley announces plans to build an 85,000
seat stadium on the waterfront. The field can be expanded to 100,000 for
football, and 125,000 for a boxing match. Cost is estimated at a whopping
$3,000,000.

1929
The Cubs open at Wrigley Field before an estimated 50,000, the biggest
Opening Day turnout they've ever had, and lose to the Pirates 4-3.

Both the Yankees and Indians, the two major league teams with the innovative
numbers on the backs of the players' uniforms are scheduled to open today,
but rain cancels the New York opener. Cleveland opens at home and hands new
Tiger's manager Bucky Harris his first loss, 5-4 in 10 innings. Cleveland
rookie Earl Averill, no. 5, cracks an 0-2 pitch for a homer in his first
at-bat, off Earl Whitehill (Averill's #3 will later be retired). The
numberless Charlie Gehringer matches the rookie in the 3rd inning, hitting
his off Cleveland's Joe Shaute. The Indians will wear numbers only on their
home uniforms. Averill is just the 2nd player to connect in his first at-bat:
Luke Stuart was the 1st, in 1921. Averill will later go into the Hall of
Fame, the first to homer in his first at-bat.

1930
The Reds sink the visiting Pirates, 3-1, with the help of Curt Walker,
who is the first Reds player to hit a homerun into the RF bleachers of
Redland Field on the fly.

The Cardinals make 20 hits to overwhelm the Cubs, 13-3. Showboat Fisher is 4
for 4 with 4 RBI giving him 7 hits in a row. He'll go 0 for 2 in tomorrow's
rain-abbreviated 3-0 loss.

1934
Rain in Washington prevents President Franklin D. Roosevelt from throwing
out the first ball of the season.

1935
In Chicago, the Cubs beat the Cards' 30-game winner, Dizzy Dean, to win,
4-3. Dean is knocked out of the game in the first frame when, with runners on
1st and 3rd, Fred Lindstrom hits a line drive single off Diz' shin. As Dean
is carried off the field, the band plays "Happy Days Are Here Again." Ray
Harrell is charged with the loss.

With the band playing Jingle Bells at Boston's Braves Field on this snowy
day with near freezing temperatures, Babe Ruth's NL debut draws the largest
Opening Day crowd, 25,000, in Braves' history. The Babe's 2-hit, debut
includes a 430-foot HR and 3 RBIs off Carl Hubbell, as Boston beats New
York 4-2. Ruth adds the game's fielding play with a shoestring catch. Boston
will win just 37 more games this year.

The Yankees open at the Stadium, losing 1-0, to the Red Sox. New York makes
just two hits off winning pitcher Wes Ferrell, but also makes two throwing
errors in the 6th inning, one by pitcher Lefty Gomez, to allow Bill Werber
to score the game's only run.

Brooklyn flogs the Phils, 12-3, behind the five hit pitching of Van Lingle
Mungo. Mungo, called the fastest working pitcher in baseball, makes short
work of the Wilsonmen, by collecting three hits himself to drive home five
runs. Curt Davis takes the loss.

The Reds open at home after appealing to the NL to change the schedule. The
NL originally had the Reds opening on the road in Pittsburgh tomorrow,
which they will still do, winning 7-4. Today, they lose 12-6 to Waite Hoyt
and the Pirates. Tony Freitas starts for the Reds.

1936
In a 10-4 win over the visiting A's, Red Sox player-manager Joe Cronin breaks
his right thumb on a force play at 2B. He will miss almost half the season.

With 2 runners on and 2 outs in the 9th inning, the Dodgers lead the Giants
6-5 when New York's Hank Lieber hits an easy fly to LF Freddie Lindstrom. But
Dodger SS Jimmy Jordan crashes into Lindstrom and the ball bounces out
of Jordan's glove. Both players lie dazed as two Giants' runners score to
win, 7-6.

In Texas, the Tokyo Giants beat the Jacksonville Jax (East Texas L), 11-2,
in an exhibition game.

1937
Joe DiMaggio, who has suffered from a lame throwing arm recently, has his
tonsils and adenoids removed at Lenox Hill hospital. He will miss his 2nd
straight Opener.

1938
The Cardinals deal a declining Dizzy Dean to Chicago for pitchers Curt Davis
and Clyde Shoun and $200,000. During his four years in the Windy City,
the future Hall of Fame right-hander will compile a 16-8 record for the
Cubs. The Cardinals also buy Tuck Stainback from the Cubs for $15,000.

Umpire Bill Stewart, fresh from coaching ("managing") the Chicago Blackhawks
to a Stanley Cup win over Toronto, is behind the plate in Boston. The Bees
beat the Red Sox, 6-2, but the Sox will win tomorrow to even the Hub City
series at 3 games apiece.

1939
Los Angeles wins its 15th straight PCL game, sweeping a pair from
Portland. The second game, a 16-7 slugfest, is shortened to 5 innings to
allow a ring to be set up for a heavyweight championship fight between Joe
Louis and Jack Roper. Louis knocks Roper out in the 1st round. LA's win
streak will reach 19, tying a PCL record set in 1903, before a loss to San
Diego on April 22.

1940
On a cool day at Comiskey Park, the White Sox team batting average does
not change as Indian fireballer Bob Feller hurls an Opening Day no-hitter
beating Chicago, 1-0, in 47-degree weather. Edgar Smith is the losing
pitcher. Rollie Hemsley has the only RBI.

On Opening Day, Franklin D. Roosevelt's errant ceremonial first pitch smashes
a Washington Post camera. The Chief Executive is not charged with a wild pitch
as Red Sox hurler Lefty Grove blanks the Senators, 1-0, throwing a 2-hitter.

In the earliest start of today's openers, the Reds shade the visiting Cubs,
2-1. Derringer outguns Lee, with all the runs coming on homers: McCormick,
Goodman and Galan for the Cubs.

Before 20,187 at Shibe Park, Chubby Dean outlasts Red Ruffing as the A's
defeat the defending champion Yankees, 2-1, in ten innings. It is Dean's
first complete game in the majors. New York's only run is unearned in the
3rd inning, but the A's tie it up on a Bob Johnson solo homer. Chubby Dean's
long sac fly in the 10th off Ruffing drives in the winning run.

At Detroit, the majors largest crowd - 49,417 - watch the Browns upset the
Tigers, 5-1. Detroit castoff George Coffman is the winner over Buck Newsom.

The highest score of the day is the 6-4 Pirates win over the Cards, with
pitchers collectively turning in one of the best openers in history. The
Philadelphia Inquirer attributes this to the new rule that allows pitchers
to start their delivery with one foot off the rubber. The rule change was
made because of the complaints that the lively ball had given the advantage
to the batters.

1942
At the IL opener in Jersey City, 55,218 tickets are sold, tops in the minors,
thanks to Mayor Frank Hague. The ball park holds 22,000. Last year's opener
sold 61,000.

1943
After beating Boston College at Fenway two days ago by a 17-2 score, the
Red Sox take on Harvard. The Bosox avenge a 1-0 loss to the Crimson 27
years ago by winning 21-0.

1944
Jack Hand of the Associated Press names the Yankees, White Sox and Senators
as favorites to win the AL pennant. Like most observers, he picks the Browns
to finish last.

1945
Under pressure from local politicians, the Boston Red Sox allow 3 blacks -
Marvin Williams, Sam Jethroe, and Jackie Robinson - to work out at Fenway
Park. None is signed.

1946
The Tigers, Cubs, Reds, Athletics and Phillies retain their 1945 ticket
prices. Other clubs increase admission costs. Typical:  $2 to $2.50 for
boxes, general admission $1.25, bleachers 60 cents. The fans respond with
the 2nd highest opening day attendance to date:  236,730. Only in 1931
(249,010) was the number exceeded.

Harry Truman attends in the official Opener in Washington, resuming the
tradition discontinued by Roosevelt in 1942. Truman becomes the first
President to throw the ceremonial first pitch left-handed. (On Opening Day in
1950, the southpaw commander-in-chief will toss two pitches, one left-handed
and one right-handed.) The Red Sox break a 3-3 tie in the 7th by pushing
across three runs against starter Roger Wolff, to give Tex Hughson a 6-3
win. Ted Williams has just one hit, but it's a 440 foot line drive HR to
dead center, one of the longest shots in Griffith history. After the game,
it's revealed that 10 of the Washington players are temporarily living in
the Senators clubhouse, a sign of the tight housing shortage.

In New York, UN Secretary General Trygve Lie attends his first baseball game
and sees manager Mel Ott hit the last HR of his career, off left-hander Oscar
Judd. The Giants defeat the Phillies (now back to their original nickname),
8-4. In the next game, Ott will injure his knee diving for a fly ball, and
his playing is curtailed. Of Ott's 511 homeruns, 323 are hit at the Polo
Grounds, the most any player has hit in one park. When he retires in 1947,
he will have failed to hit a HR in Philadelphia after the Baker Bowl was
abandoned in 1938.

At Boston, the Braves open with a 5-3 win over the Dodgers, but the win
doesn't sit well with some 5,000 fans (of 18,261) who go home with green
paint on their clothes. The stadium seats were freshly painted, but the cold
weather prevented all of the seats from drying completely. The Braves will
run an advertisement apologizing to fans and offering to reimburse for any
cleaning bills. Claims pour in from around the country and the offer will
cost the Braves more than $6,000.

In Detroit, a crowd of more than 52,000 cheer as Hal Newhouser stops the
Browns, 2-1, striking out 8. Hank Greenberg's homer into the LF stands is
the margin of victory.

The White Sox open at home and manage just 3 hits and no runs in losing,
1-0, to Bob Feller and the Indians. Feller strikes out 10 and his shutout
is saved in the 9th when CF Bob Lemon makes a diving catch and doubles the
runner off 2B. Bill Dietrich takes the tough loss.

At Shibe Park, Spud Chandler, 38, allows just 5 hits as the Yankees beat the
A's, 5-0. Chandler spent most of 1944-45 in the Army and appeared in just
5 games in two years. Joe DiMaggio has a two-run homer and Tommy Henrich
a two-run double to pace the offense. A's starter Russ Christopher allows
all the runs in his six innings of work.

1947
The Cubs buy veteran Lonnie Frey from the Reds, but will keep him just 9
weeks before selling him to the Yankees.

1948
The future super station WGN-TV televises a baseball game for the first
time. (The first broadcast for the Cubs was on WBKB-TV in 1946.) With
Jack Brickhouse doing the play-by-play, the White Sox beat the Cubs, 4-1,
in the first game of the Windy City Classic played at Wrigley Field.

In an exhibition game between the Braves and Red Sox at Braves Field, the
Sox unload 24 hits to win, 19-6. Ted Williams is 3 for 5 with a HR. There
are a couple more hits as it takes both teams to break up a fight between
Braves Earl Torgeson and Sox Billy Hitchcock.

1949
At Fenway, Tom O'Brien and Junior Stephens clout homers to give the Red
Sox a 5-2 win over their Hub rivals, the Braves. Mel Parnell gives up 3
hits in 5 innings.

1950
In Los Angeles, Steve Souchock of Sacramento (PCL) homers in the 7th, 8th
and 9th innings in a 19-6 win. The last homer is a grand slam as Souchock
drives in 9 runs. The veteran will bang 30 homers this year and be back in
the majors in 1951.

1951
Rain cancels today's presidential opener in Washington, washing out the
debut of rookie Tom Morgan. Morgan would have been the first Yankee rookie
ever to start an opener.

1952
The Dodgers' Duke Snider goes 5 for 6 in a 14-8 win over the Boston
Braves. Campy drives in 5 runs with a double and homer as the Dodgers amass
20 hits.

Rain postpones two openers today, but at Washington, Mel Parnell, batting
7th ahead of Lepcio and Niarhos, pitches a 3-0 win, allowing 3 hits.

1953
In a Forbes Field contest in which Pittsburgh will prevail, 14-12, the
Phillies score nine times and the Pirates tally six in the fifth inning
tying the National League record as 15 batters cross home plate during
the frame. Philadelphia's second baseman, Connie Ryan, establishes a new
team record with six hits (four singles and two doubles) in six at-bats.
Ryan will be 5 for 5 against the Bucs on the 26th.

In the home opener at Comiskey, lefty Billy Pierce of the White Sox throws
a one-hitter against the Browns. Bobby Young's double in the 7th is the
only St. Louis safety in the 1-0 shutout. Young also had the lone hit last
year against Feller. In his Browns debut, Harry Brecheen allows the White
Sox just 2 hits in losing.

At Washington, President Dwight Eisenhower tosses out the first ball and then
watches as the Senators lose, 6-3, to the Yankees in a scheduled day-night
DH. The night game is canceled because of cold weather. Sain is the winner
over Bob Porterfield.

1955
Enroute to losing their first 5 games, the Redlegs hit 5 solo HRs but lose
to the Braves 9-5. The Braves' Johnny Logan goes 5 for 5, and Del Crandall,
Johnny Logan and Joe Adcock slug solo homers for Milwaukee. Cincy's 5 solo
shots - 2 by Ray Jablonski - and just 5 runs scored ties a ML record.

In St. Louis, the Cubs hit 6 homers, including consecutive homers by Randy
Jackson, Ernie Banks and Dee Fondy in the 2nd inning, but the Cards win in 14
innings, 12-11. Wally Moon's bloop single is the winner after Sarni's bloop
double drops when Sauer and Banks do an Alphonse-Gaston number. Jackson
has a 2nd HR in the 3rd, and Banks and Fondy hit back-to-back consecutive
homers in the 12th, tying a ML record for doing it twice in a game, but
Moon's 2-run HR deadlocks at 11 apiece.

1956
The Athletics purchase OF Johnny Groth from the Senators.

1957
The Phillies set an Opening Day record at Connie Mack Stadium as 37,667
fans pay to see the Dodgers Gino Cimoli hit a 12-inning HR to win the game
7-6. Prior to the game, a statue of Connie Mack is dedicated as part of
the Opening Day ceremonies. The eight-foot statue of the 'Tall Tactician',
which depicts the A's long-time owner and manager with one foot in the
dugout and one foot on the top step of it waving his trademark scorecard
to position his players, was created by well-known sculptor Harry Rosin.

At Yankee Stadium, Andy Carey's bases-loaded fly ball single in the 9th
gives the Yankees a 2-1 win over the Senators, as Whitey Ford bests Chuck
Stobbs. Yogi Berra accounts for the other Yankee run with a 7th inning
homer. The 0-2 Senators will lose 16 of their next 20 games.

The Giants pack off P Dick Littlefield and OF Bob Lennon to the Cubs for
2 veterans named Ray - Katt and Jablonski.

In the season opener at Cincinnati, Stan Musial raps out 4 hits, including
2 doubles, to lead the Cardinals to a 13-4 win. Cards' rookie B.G. Smith
debuts with a HR and a single to back former Reds P Herm Wehmeier's win.

Braves ace Warren Spahn retires the last 14 Cubs enroute to a 4-1 Opening
Day victory over host Chicago. The loss spoils the managerial debut of Cubs
skipper Bob Scheffing as well as the debut of the Cubs new blue pinstriped
uniforms, their first pin stripes in 25 years.

In a duel of ace southpaws, Cleveland's Herb Score gives up 2 walks and a
single in the 11th to lose to Chicago's Billy Pierce, 3-2. Score walks 11.

1958
In the first Giants night game at Seals Stadium, the Dodgers spoil the
evening with a 13-1 pasting. Johnny Podres is the winner and Duke Snider
adds a 425-foot shot over the RF wall.

1959
Phillie Dave Philley, who ended 1958 with 8 consecutive pinch hits,
starts 1959 with a pinch-hit double in his first pinch at-bat to extend
his ML record. Despite Philley's new mark, Lew Burdette and the Braves win,
7-3. Burdette allows just 6 hits in beating Russ Meyer.

Reliever Billy O'Dell gets the win as the Orioles top the visiting Yankees,
7-4. O'Dell relieves George Bamberger, who pitches 6 1/3 innings in his
only ML start.

1960
Sam Jones' no-hit bid is spoiled with 2 out in the 8th by Walt Moryn's
pinch HR. The Giants beat the Cubs 6-1.

Pittsburgh.

1961
Beginning his historic homerun chase of the Babe, Roger Maris finally
connects for his first round tripper in the twelfth game of the season. The
fifth-inning solo shot is off Tiger pitcher Paul Foytack.

1962
Philadelphia's Cal McLish and Bob Gibson of the Cardinals, both fail to
finish an inning when each starter allows six runs to score in the first
frame. Ernie Broglio gets the victory tossing 8 1/3 innings of shutout ball
in the Redbirds 12-6 victory over the Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium.

At Chicago, 42-year-old rookie Diomedes Olivo picks up his first ML win
as the Pirates win their 5th straight, 6-5. For the Cubs it is their 6th
straight loss.

from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn and Giants' Holy Water from the Harlem
River at the location where it flowed passed the Polo Grounds.

At Yankee Stadium, Whitey Ford pitches 11 innings in losing to the Red Sox,
4-3. Bob Tillman, with three singles, triples in the 11th, and pinch runner
Roman Mejias scores on a wild pitch. Mickey Heffner pitches the bottom of
the 11th with Dick Radatz getting the win.

1966
On the second day of the season, Jack Fischer gives up just five hits in
his complete-game effort beating the Braves at Shea Stadium, 3-1. The win

Philadelphia.

1967
At Yankee Stadium, The Red Sox and Yankees struggle for 18 innings before
New York wins it, 7-6, in a game that lasts 5 hours and 50 minutes. Carl
Yastrzemski and Tony Conigliaro each have 5 hits for the Sox, but it is
Joe Pepitone's two-out single that beats Lee Stange. Al Downing is the winner.

Washington and Chicago struggle for 16 innings before the White Sox win,
4-3, in the bottom of the 16th on 3 straight walks. Two intentional walks
load the bases and a non-intentional forces home the winner.

In California, the Orioles earn a doubleheader split when Steve Barber
flirts with a no-hitter before allowing a 9th inning one-out double to
Jim Fregosi. It is the only hit Barber allows, winning 3-0. In game 1, the
Angels win 5-4 in 10 innings on Fregosi's RBI single. Lew Burdette (1-0),
in relief, notches the last decision of his career. When he's released in
September, the veteran will finish at 203-144.

1969
The Orioles take first place in the AL East with an 11-8 win at Boston,
in a game stopped in the last half of the 8th because of rain. Baltimore
will remain in 1st place the rest of the season. Billy Conigliaro, playing
in place of his brother, smashes a pair of homers for his first ML hits,
but Buford, Blair and Brooks Robinson answer for the O's.

to a 6-1 victory over the Angels.

1970

running the bases against the Dodgers in the 3rd inning. He is replaced
by 19-year-old rookie Don Gullett, who earns his first ML victory, 12-2,
with 5 innings of shutout ball. Lee May collects 4 hits including a grand
slam. Maloney, 29, will never win another game in the majors.

1972
On the second day of the season, 22-year-old Burt Hooton, making his his
fourth career start (so far he has allowed just 8 hits in 30 IP), no-hits
the Phillies at Wrigley Field , 4-0. The Cubs hurler becomes the 12th player
in major league history to throw a no-hitter in his rookie season. Throwing
his knucklecurve, Hooton walks 7 and fans 7.

With a rainout yesterday, the Orioles and Yankees decide to open the season
in Baltimore with a doubleheader. But rain wipes out the nitecap and the
O's win the rain-shortened opener before just 11,995 fans, 3-1. There is
one out in the bottom of the 7th when the game is called. The O's score an
unearned run in the 2nd and Brooks Robinson knocks in two more to back Pat
Dobson's pitching. After a long rain delay, Doyle Alexander pitched the
7th for the O's.

Hitting for the cycle, Dave Kingman drives in 6 runs to lead the Giants to a
10-6 win over the Astros. The third sacker makes an out in his final at-bat
after clouting a 3-run homer in the 7th. Sudden Sam McDowell, making his
NL debut, pitches 5 2/3 innings for the win despite allowing 3-run homers
to Bob Watson and Tommy Helms.

1973
At Fenway, Boston's Reggie Smith homers from both sides of the plate during
a 9-7 loss to Detroit.

Brewer rookie Gorman Thomas hits his first ML homer, off Jim Palmer, to
tie the O's in the 9th, and Milwaukee wins it in the 11th on Pedro Garcia's
game-winner. The Orioles split for the day by taking the nitecap.

1977
Regulations force Oakland P Vida Blue to discard his old, discolored "lucky"
cap because it is no longer "identical in color, trim and style" to those
of his teammates.

In Milwaukee, Cecil Cooper hits a 2-run shot in the bottom of the 9th off
Sparky Lyle to tie the Yankees, 3-3, then a Sal Bando triple and a single
by Steve Brye wins it.

1978
Cardinal Bob Forsch (3-0) hurls a no-hitter in beating the Phillies
5-0. Forsch walks 2 and strikes out 3 in pitching the first no-hitter in
St. Louis by a Cardinal since Jesse Haines in 1924. Roger Freed's bases
loaded pinch double drives in 3 runs to help beat Randy Lersch. Less than a
year later, Bob's brother Ken of the Houston Astros will pitch a no-hitter
against Atlanta making the siblings the only brothers to throw no-hitters
in the big leagues.

1980
Oakland's Matt Keough matches last season's victory total with his 2nd win

1982
At Detroit, the Yankees' Roy Smalley makes the first and last outs - all 3
outs - in the 3rd inning as the Yankees score 5 times. Smalley strikes out
to start the frame, and ends it by lining into a DP. Ron Guidry coasts to
his first win of the year, 10-2.

1983
Steve Garvey appears in his 1,118th straight game breaking the National League
record established by Hall of Fame outfielder Billy Williams playing for
the Cubs in 1970. The Padres' first baseman, who played 13 seasons with the
Dodgers before signing as a free agent with San Diego in the offseason, will
see his consecutive game streak end at 1,207, the third-longest span in major
league history at the time, due to a dislocated thumb suffered as a result
of a collision at home plate during the first game of a doubleheader later
this season. Today Garvey goes 2 for 4 in an 8-5 Padres loss at Los Angeles.

Montreal's Charlie Lea pitches the ML's 2nd one-hitter in as many days,
shutting out the Astros 2-0. The only Houston hit is Terry Puhl's pinch
single with 2 out in the 8th inning.

off Beard. Engle and Mitchell connect back to back, and Gaetti and Hatcher
also homer.

1984
In his first three at-bats, the A's Dave Kingman hits three homeruns,
including his 12th career grand slam, driving in eight runs against the
Mariners in a 9-6 victory. It is Kingman's 5th career 3-HR game, one shy
