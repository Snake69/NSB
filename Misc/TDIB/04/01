1909
The National Commissioner awards P Ben Henderson to the Indians. Both the
Boston Nationals and Cleveland had claimed the pitcher.

1910
Johnny Kling, Cubs catcher on their 1906-08 pennant winners is
reinstated. Kling won the world pocket billiard title over the winter of
1908-09 and swapped a baseball bat for a pool cue. Kling, who played for
a Chicago semipro team while holding out for the entire 1909 season, is
fined $700, and required to play for the Cubs at his 1908 salary of $4,500.

1911
All National League umpires are asked by league president Tom Lynch to
provide evidence of vision tests. Tests showed all have perfect vision.

1914
Future Hall of Famer Rube Waddell, weakened by a heroic effort to help contain
a winter flood in Kentucky, dies at 37 of tuberculosis in a San Antonio

Giants SS Travis Jackson has an appendicitis operation that puts him out
of action for 6 weeks.

onto a ball dropped from the Washington Monument, a height of 504 feet.

1933
Babe Ruth makes his 3rd appearance in Memphis and like the last 3 opening
games, the Chicks defeat the Yankees, winning 5-4. Tomorrow the Yanks will
win, 6-0, behind Lefty Gomez. Ruth goes hitless getting no good pitches
to hit.

1936
Babe Herman, who hit .316 for the Reds last year, says on the phone to
Chuck Dressen that he'll stay home unless the Reds meet his terms. GM Larry
MacPhail thunders, "Herman will play with the Reds or he won't play."

In a poll of 98 sports editors and writers, 43 pick the Cardinals to win
the NL pennant. 39 go with the Cubs.

1937
The Reds sell Babe Herman to the Tigers. The 34-year-old outfielder,
batting .300 for his new team, will only appear in 17 games for Detroit
before effectively retiring from the game, although he'll return to play
briefly for the war-time Dodgers in 1945.

1938
Commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis, not a fan of Branch Rickey's farm
system, grants free agency to a group of nine Cardinal minor leaguers that
includes Pete Reiser. A reported gentlemen's agreement, that has Brooklyn
signing and hiding the 19-year-old in the low minors to be traded back to
St. Louis at a later date, doesn't work when Brooklyn manager Leo Durocher
disobeys orders allowing the phenom to display his amazing ability in spring
training exhibition games.

1944
The Red Sox play their first exhibition game, taking on the talented Coast
Guard "Cutters" at Curtis Bay Navy Yard. The Cutters, managed by Dick Porter,
score 12 runs in the bottom of the 1st, knocking out Joe Wood Jr Hank Sauer
hits a bases loaded triple off Mike Ryba in the frame. The final is 23-16
as the Red Sox kick in 8 errors in the loss.

Gerald Juzek pitches 3 innings for Los Angeles in a PCL exhibition game
less than 2 years after suffering a severe leg wound while fighting in
Guadalcanal. Juzek was told he would never walk again.

1947
Branch Rickey deflects pressure on Jackie Robinson by keeping him in Montreal,
although it is clear the contending Dodgers can use the 1946 International
League batting king.

1950
No joke. The Hollywood Stars (PCL) open their season against Portland clad in
shorts, rayon shirts and knee socks. "These suits will give us more speed,"
predicts manager Fred Haney. But the outfits are used only occasionally
during the season.

1951
The Browns trade infielder George "Snuffy" Stirnweiss and SS Merrill Combs
to Cleveland for 3B Fred Marsh and $35,000.

1952
The PCL institutes a new rule that prohibits players from leaving their
mitts on the field between innings. They are allowed to drop them in foul
territory. The Majors will go to a similar rule in 1954.

1957
Like kissing your sister. At West Palm Beach, the Athletics and Pirates
play 18 innings without a score before the game is called.

1962
Dave DeBusschere, a hoop star at the University of Detroit, signs with
the White Sox as a pitcher. The 21-year-old right-hander will compile a
3-4 record in 36 appearances with Chicago before moving to the National
Basketball Association where he will be named as one of the 50 greatest
players in the history of the league.

1963
Former Brooklyn Dodger Duke Snider returns to New York when the Mets purchase
him from LA for $40,000. The 36-year-old outfielder, who will represent New
York in the All-Star game, will be told at the end of the season by Buzzi
Bavassi, his former GM, that the Yankees had asked for him before he was
dealt to back up Mickey Mantle.

1964
Cleveland's manager Birdie Tebbetts suffers a heart attack and will be
sidelined until July 5th. George Strickland will fill in for three months,
until the 51-year-old skipper returns to the Indians dugout with limited
duties.

1967
Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall retires and begins his career as the team's radio
broadcaster. He will pitch batting practice when the team is on the road.

The Mets trade Ed Bressoud, Danny Napoleon and cash to the Cardinals for
Don Kirkwood, John Verhoeven and John Flannery.

1968
The Braves purchase Stu Miller from the Orioles. The 40-year-old right-hander
will only throw 1 1/3 innings in two appearances for Atlanta before retiring
from baseball.

1969
After acquiring Lou Piniella from the Indians in the expansion draft, the
Seattle Pilots trade him to the Royals in exchange for Steve Whitaker and
John Gelna. The 25-year-old outfielder will have a stellar season in Kansas
City being named the league's Rookie of the Year.

1970
The Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, headed by Bud Selig, purchases the
Seattle Pilots for $10,800,000. Although negotiations were conducted over
a period of months, it was not until March 13 when Judge Sidney Volinn,
a federal bankruptcy referee, declared the Pilots bankrupt and orders
the Seattle Pilots be sold to Selig's group. Pilots tickets go on sale
tomorrow. The American League expansion team's tenure in the northwest is
over after just one season when the club is hastily moved to Milwaukee to
start the new season as the Brewers.

1972
The first players' strike in baseball history wipes 6-8 games off the schedule
of each MLB team. It is agreed that the missed games will be canceled
altogether and not made up; this results in teams not being scheduled for
the same number of games in the 1972 season. The schedule imbalance would
lead to the Detroit Tigers edging the Boston Red Sox by only one-half game
to win the American League East Division championship. The strike results
in the team owners adding salary arbitration to the collective bargaining
agreement, and increasing pension fund payments.

1976
After he is released by the Padres, Bobby Tolan (.255, 5, 48) signs as a
free-agent with the Phillies. The outfielder-first baseman will be released
again after playing only 15 games for Philadelphia signing with the Pirates
in June.

1978
Starting off with a bang, Japanese star Sadaharu Oh hits a grand-slam HR
on Opening Day. It is his 757th HR.

1980
After failing to come up with a new collective bargaining agreement with the
owners, the Executive Board of the Players' Association votes unanimously
to cancel the 92 remaining exhibition games and to strike on May 22nd if
a deal has not been reached by then. During spring training, the players
had voted 971-1 in favor of a strike. The lone dissenter was Kansas City's
Jerry Terrell, who voted no for religious reasons.

1981
Houston trades P Ken Forsch to the Angels for INF Dickie Thon.

1982
The Mets ship popular OF Lee Mazzilli to the Rangers for minor league
pitchers Ron Darling and Walt Terrell.

Surely you jest. The Cards trade P Bob Shirley to the Reds for minor league
pitchers Jose Brito and Jeff Lahti. Brito won't make it but Lahti will have
more than a cup of latte, going 17-11 in 5 years. After a season in Cincy,
Bob Shirley will go to the Yankees.

The Yankees trade Gene Nelson and Bill Caudill and a future player (Bobby
Brown) to the Seattle Mariners for Shane Rawley.

1986
In a purge of its pitching staff, Atlanta releases veterans Pascual Perez,
Len Barker, Terry Forster and Rick Camp.

Gooden avoids suspension by agreeing to enter a drug rehabilitation program.

St. Louis sends highly regarded youngsters OF Andy Van Slyke, C Mike
LaValliere and P Mike Dunne to Pittsburgh in exchange for All-Star catcher
Tony Pena.

1989
Former Yale University and National League president Bart Giamatti becomes
the seventh commissioner of major league baseball. Baseball's new leader,
a lifelong Red Sox fan, is the author of "The Green Fields of the Mind",
an essay which laments the end of a season in Boston.

1991
Expos trade OF Otis Nixon and minor league 3B Sol Rodriguez to the Braves
in exchange for C Jimmy Kremers and a player to be named later.

1996
The website Nationalpastime.com appears for the first time on the internet. It
is one of the first to feature baseball history on a daily basis.

Rallying from a 6-0 deficit, the Mets beat the Cardinals, 7-6, making it
the biggest Opening Day comeback of the century

Only 7,296 fans show up at Cashman Field to watch the A's lose their season
opener to the Blue Jays, 9-6. Due to renovations in the Oakland Coliseum,
the team play their first six home games in the Las Vegas minor league
ball park making it the first time a "neutral" venue has been used in Major
League Baseball since 1969, when the White Sox played a few of their home
games in County Stadium in nearby Milwaukee.

At Riverfront Stadium, umpire John McSherry calls time from behind the plate
and collapses on the field with a massive heart attack and dies. The popular
McSherry, a veteran of 21 seasons, had been suffering from a series of medical
problems, aggravated by his weight of 328 pounds. The game, just 7 pitches
old between the Reds and Expos, is called, though owner Marge Schott feels
otherwise:  "Snow this morning and now this. I don't believe it. I feel
cheated. This isn't supposed to happen to us, not in Cincinnati. This is
our history, our tradition, our team. Nobody feels worse than me." Schott,
who will later apologize, says it with flowers instead. But the Dayton
Daily News will report on the 28th that the flowers she sends were given
to her by a television station covering the Reds.

Snow postpones the Yankee opener in Cleveland.

John McSherry, 51, dies. He was a National League umpire since 1971 and
worked in eight NLCS and two World Series.

1997
The Padres score 11 runs in the 6th inning against the Mets, going on to
win, 12-5. Three consecutive homeruns - by Chris Gomez, Rickey Henderson and
Quilvio Veras - are the inning's big blows. The 11 runs ties a 3-year-old
record for the most runs scored in an inning on Opening day this century.

Albert Belle, Chicago's $55 million man, doubles in the 1st run and clocks
a 2-run HR in the 8th to help the White Sox to a 6-5 10-inning win over
Toronto. In the 10th, Ray Durham singles and comes around to score on a
ball that eludes the SS for an error.

1998
At Camden Yards, the Orioles rock the Royals, 10-1, as Scott Erickson records
his 100th major league victory. O's skipper Ray Miller, who hadn't won a
game since managing the Twins in 1986, enjoys his first win with Baltimore.

Seattle 1B David Segui homers from both sides of the plate in the Mariners
9-7 loss to Cleveland. Segui adds a double and drives in 5 runs.

The expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays win their first game in franchise history,
beating the Tigers 11-8. Fred McGriff has 4 RBIs on 3 hits.

The Angels put together a 4-run rally in the 4th to hand the Yankees a
4-1 opening day defeat. Matt Walbeck's 2-RBI triple was the big hit in
the game. Chuck Finley earns the win as he gives up a run on 4 hits and
6 walks in 7 IP, with 7 K's. Chuck Knoblauch enters the record books as
he plays his 1000th game at 2B and sets the AL record for highest career
fielding percentage.

The Angels sign free agent pitcher Steve Sparks to a minor league
contract. He'll go 0-8 in the minors, earning a promotion, where he'll go
9-4. The knuckler missed the entire 1997 season when he injured himself
ripping a phone book in half following a spring training game.

1999
No joke. Enraged that P Hideki Irabu fails to cover 1B on a ground ball hit
during an exhibition game, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner calls him a
"fat pussy toad." Steinbrenner will later apologize to Irabu.

2001
The Blue Jays defeat the Rangers, 8-1, as the major league baseball season
opens in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Former Ranger Esteban Loiza gets the victory,
striking out 9 in 7 innings while Shannon Stewart and Tony Batista slug HRs
for Toronto. Texas' $252 million shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, gets 2 hits in
his Texas debut but makes a critical error.

2002
The Mets beat the Pirates, 6-2, improving their record in openers to 26-15,
the best record in the majors.

In the opener at Boston, the Blue Jays take an 8-3 lead against Pedro
Martinez and hold on for a 12-11 win. Darrin Fletcher, with 4 RBIs, hits
a sac fly in the 9th for the win.

A cow named Cinci Freedom, who jumped a six-foot fence to avoid slaughter
and evaded capture for 10 days before being sent to a sanctuary by artist
Peter Max and his wife Mary is excused from scheduled participation in the
Cincinnati Reds' opening day parade, because she is too skittish. Following
the parade, Aaron Boone's 9th inning sac fly gives the Reds a 5-4 win over
the Cubs.

2003
The Yankees defeat the Blue Jays, 9-7, as Toronto SS Mike Bordick's record
streak for games without an error ends at 110. He booted Bubba Trammell's
grounder in the 3rd inning for his error after 544 chances without a miscue.

Kevin Millar hits a homer in the 16th inning to give the Boston Red Sox
a 9-8 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Millar, who entered as a
pinch-hitter in the 14th, lines a 1-2 pitch into the left-field seats off
loser Jorge Sosa. The Red Sox make 4 hits after the sixth inning, but blow
a couple of chances to win before Millar's homer bails out a bullpen that
blows a three-run lead in the late innings for the 2nd straight night. The
Devil Rays strand a club-record 21 runners.

2004
Indians CF Milton Bradley left the team and is reportedly on the trading
block. In an exhibition game yesterday Bradley did not run out a pop fly that
dropped for a single, and was promptly pulled. According to the Cleveland
Plain Dealer, even if he's not traded by Opening Day, he won't be with the
Indians on Monday. They are right. On the 3rd he goes to the Dodgers for
minor league blue chipper Franklin Gutierrez and a player to be named later.

2005
Albert Pujols does not strike out in any of the 21 Cardinals spring training
games. In his 68 plate appearances the St. Louis first baseman finishes
the exhibition season with a .458 batting average, six homers, and 20 RBI.

2006
A day prior to the start of the season, the White Sox ink Jose Contreras
(15-7, 3.61) to a $29 million three-year contract extension. The 34-year-old
Cuban native was the World Champ's most effective pitcher during the
team's stretch run to the AL pennant, posting an 11-2 mark following the
All-Star game.

The Rangers trade OF David Dellucci to the Phillies in exchange for P
Robinson Tejeda and OF Jake Blalock, brother of Texas OF Hank.

2008
With two outs in the 10th inning at Dolphin Stadium, Robert Andino's first
career round tripper is a memorable one as his walk-off homer gives the
Marlins a 5-4 victory over the Mets. The post-game celebration is short-lived
when the Miami native takes off for home to meet police after getting a
text message from his wife informing him their house may have an intruder.

On Opening Day in Los Angeles, Juan Pierre's 434 consecutive game streak,
the longest current one in the major leagues, comes to an end, when the
Dodger outfielder does not play in the 3-2 victory over the Giants. New
skipper Joe Torre plays Andre Ethier in left field in place of the highly
paid, but light-hitting fly chaser.

2009
After tallying a run in the top of the first, the Kentucky State baseball
team find themselves on the short end of a 22-1 score at the end of the
inning. After the Colonels of Eastern Kentucky University score 27 more
times in the next three frames, the teams decide to halt the contest in
the middle of the fifth giving EKU a 49-1 triumph over the Thorobreds.

The Brewers release Mike Lamb.

2013
Bryce Harper, providing all of the offense the Nationals will need, becomes
the youngest player to homer twice on Opening Day. The 20-year-old outfielder,
playing in his first Opening Day as a major leaguer, hits solo shots in
the first and fourth frames in Washington's 2-0 victory over Miami.

On Opening Day, Jackie Bradley Jr. has a memorable major league debut when
he walks three times, scores twice, and robs Robinson Cano of an extra-base
hit with an outstanding defensive play in the Red Sox' 8-2 victory over New
York at Yankee Stadium. The 22-year-old Boston rookie outfielder also makes
uniform history becoming the first major leaguer to wear "Jr." on the back
of his jersey.

Rockies reliever Adam Ottavino, who will end the day with an 0-1 record
when he gives up a walk-off sac fly in an Opening Day loss to Milwaukee,
becomes the first big league pitcher to wear the number 0, joining position
players Oddibe McDowell (1985-88) Junior Ortiz (1989-2004) and Al Oliver
(1978-85). Several players, including hurlers Bobo Newsome (1943), Curtis
Leskanic (2000-01), Rick White (2005-06) and Brian Wilson (2003-14), have
donned a double-zero.

2015
Auction items featured in Sotheby's "New York Sale" include the 1967
Mets' bullpen cart, which is shaped like a baseball wearing a cap. The
electric-powered vehicle, valued between $20,000 and $30,000, fetches an
amazing high bid of $125,000.

2018
In his much-anticipated pitching debut, Shohei Ohtani, strikes out six batters
in six innings while allowing three runs and picks up his first big league
win when the Angels beat the 7-4 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. The
23-year-old Japanese sensation, also touted for his prowess as a hitter,
does not have a plate appearance in the American League contest.

2019
Merrill Kelly and Jon Duplantier became the first teammates in Major League
history to make their major league debuts in the same game, with one pitcher
earning a win and the other earning a save, against the San Diego Padres.

2021
The Arizona Diamondbacks became the first team in Major League Opening Day
history to hit four home runs in one inning, against the San Diego Padres.
