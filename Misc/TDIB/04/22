14,000 fans come raising nearly $9,500 for the relief fund through their
program purchases. The Giants beat the Yankees, 11-2.

1922
The Browns' Ken Williams hits 3 HRs, and two singles, against the visiting
White Sox, with George Sisler on base each time, to lead St. Louis to a 10-7

tugging of Mrs. Coolidge, who eventually stands as well. The President's

Frank McCormick adds, "It was like hitting a piece of cement."

After a day's delay because of rain, the Yankees open at the Stadium
with a 5-4 come-from-behind win against the Senators. Johnny Murphy, who
relieves starter Ernie Bonham in the 9th and tosses just one pitch, is the
victor. Roy Weatherly, filling in for DiMaggio in center field, drives home
the tying and winning runs with a double off Owen Sheetz. Mickey Haefner
is the losing pitcher. Joe Gordon has the game's only homer, an 8th-inning

racist skipper Ben Chapman, repeatedly shout racial epitaphs, throw
beanballs, and intentionally spike Brooklyn's rookie first baseman,
the first African-American to play major league baseball in the 20th
century. The incident is so severe Philadelphia's infielder Jeep Handley,
will later publicly apologize, and the team's manager will be chastised
by baseball commissioner, Happy Chandler, for his bigoted leadership.
Jackie keeps his cool throughout the game, singles, and scores in the 8th
inning. Hal Gregg allows just one hit and the Dodgers win, 1-0.

the Indians beat the Browns, 5-0.

of six base on balls. Boston starter Tex Hughson hands out four in the 6th,
sandwiched around a DP. Allie Reynolds follows with a single. Tommy Henrich,
who won the first two Yankee games with a homerun, has four walks before

on a squeeze play by Jackie Robinson that would have tied the game. Alston
vehemently protests the call and gets sent to the showers for his efforts.

a 3-run homer by Ted Kazanski as Robin Roberts wins, 3-1, over Johnny
Antonelli. New York takes the nitecap, 9-7, when Willie Mays belts a 9th
inning 3-run homer. When the Phillies bat in the bottom of the 9th, fans
start throwing bottles and cans on the field. RF Whitey Lockman calls time,
and returns with a helmet. "I wouldn't mind getting hit by a regular bottle,
but when they break off the tops and throw them at you, that's too much,"
he says later. Outside police are called in to stop the bottle tossers. Beer
is not sold at Connie Mack Stadium, but fans can bring bottles and cans
into the park.

White Sox garner just one hit, by John Callison. Jim Landis makes 2 outs,
both grounders to the pitcher, in the strange inning. Nellie Fox drives in

out 19 Padres, including the last 10 in succession in winning 2-1 for the
Mets. Mike Corkin takes the loss. In this century, no one has ever struck
out 10 in a row, a ML record. Counting the ten whiffs yesterday, the Pads
have struck out 29 times in two games, a NL record that will be topped on
June 14/15, 1998 when the Astros miss 32 times in two days. Jerry Grote
adds one foul fly catch to his 19 putouts via K's.

the ball over 3rd and Morgan scores.

1976
It takes two days to accomplish the feat, but Tim Foli becomes the first
Expos player to hit for the cycle in franchise history when he homers in
the eighth inning of a suspended game. Before the Wrigley Field contest was
halted yesterday because of darkness, the Montreal shortstop had stroked

in that order, for a rare 'natural cycle'.

shutout relief.

Before a crowd of 36,005 - 4th largest in Fenway history - the Indians

teams. Cleveland's starter, Rick Wise, traded to Cleveland in the final week

1980
In a classic Wrigley Field slugfest, the Cubs beat the Cardinals 16-12 on

and doubles in the 9th.

getting a double play in the first inning.

drives in 5 runs as host Montreal clips the Cardinals, 8-0. Rodriguez,
starting in LF for the injured Moises Alou, homered twice on Saturday and
is 9 for 14. Montreal (12-7) leads Atlanta in the NL East by 1 1/2 games.

Shawon Dunston makes 4 errors, but participates in 4 of the Giants 5 double
plays in an 11-8 loss to the Astros. Dunston is mercifully lifted in the 8th,
but his 4 errors is the most by a Giant since Bob Brenly's 4 in a 1986 game.

In Arlington, Harold Baines, with a 3-run blast, and Robin Ventura hit
consecutive homers in the 6th as the Sox halt the Rangers' five-game win

the 8th to cinch Alex Fernandez' 3rd win.

1997
After 4 months of on-and-off negotiations, the Yankees acquire the rights
to Japanese P Hideki Irabu from the San Diego Padres for $3 million. New
York sends injured OF Ruben Rivera and minor leaguer P Rafael Medina to San
Diego. The Padres sweeten the deal by sending three minor leaguers to NY:  2B
Homer Bush and outfielders Gordon Amerson and Vernon Maxwell. Irabu's team,
the Chiba Lotte Marines, gave San Diego exclusive rights to the 27-year-old
righthander, but Irabu refused to sign with the Padres, saying he would
only go to the Yankees.

1998
White Sox 2B Ray Durham ties a major league record by reaching base on an
error 3 times in Chicago's 14-7 victory over the Indians. Durham adds 3 hits,
scores 4 runs and drives home 2. Chicago breaks the game open by scoring 9

and he triples and scores on another error.

The Yankees, in first by a half game, pound Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte
shuts down the Blue Jays, as the Yankees prevail, 9-1. Scott Brosius has 3
hits and 5 RBIs. Pettitte pitches a complete game and allows 1 run (unearned)
on 6 hits and 1 walk, with 6 strike outs. Clemens takes the loss allowing

9 runs in a game and the 2nd time against the Yankees. Clemens K's 6 and
reaches 2900 career strikeouts.

1999

homeruns in April of 1998.

Angels Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus all go deep in the fourth inning
against Devil Rays' hurler Dwight Gooden, and then they again all homer off
Roberto Hernandez in the ninth. It is the first time in major league history
that the same three players homered in the same inning twice in a game.

After being hit by a pitch thrown by White Sox starter Jim Parque, Dean
Palmer charges the mound beginning a series of brawls which continue to
erupt during the bean ball-filled game. When the dust settles in Chicago's
14-6 victory over the Tigers at Comiskey Park, nine players, one coach and
one manager will have been ejected from the contest, and as a result of the
incident sixteen individuals, including players, coaches and managers, will
be suspended with another nine being fined. Chicago OF Chris Singleton goes
5 for 5, including a double and HR, and drives home 5 runs for the White Sox.

2001
A new number, 455, will be added with 3, 5, 14, 18, 19, 21 and 42, on the
second deck in right field. The three digit number will join the other
previously Indian retired numbers as a honor to the fans for setting a
sellout streak record which lasted for 455 games over a five-year period
at Jacobs Field.

Colorado's Pedro Astacio throws a brilliant game against the Snakes in
Arizona, winning, 2-1. They hit him 2 times, and he hits them 4 times,
tying a ML record for HBP in a game. The last to do so was Orel Hershiser
on April 19, 2000. Pedro is lifted in the 9th after hitting his 4th batter
and allowing a single. Larry Walker has a solo HR to back Astacio's 50th
career win with the Rocks, the first franchise pitcher to reach that level.

Eric Davis of the San Francisco Giants hits the third pinch-hit homer of
his career, a 3-run shot off Milwaukee Brewer pitcher Jeff D'Amico in the
fifth inning. His last pinch homer was in 1989, off Rich Gossage (then with
the Giants). D'Amico follows the blast with 2 walks, then reliever Will
Cunnane adds 2 more walks and a HBP, good for 2 runs. Shawn Estes wins,
6-4. Jamie Quirk went the longest between pinch dingers at 5,486 days,
or approximately 15 years.

2003
The Cubs down the Padres, 7-2. San Diego pitcher Brian Lawrence ties a ML
record by hitting 3 Chicago players - Alex Gonzalez, Sammy Sosa and Hee
Seop Choi - with pitches in the 4th inning. All 3 score. Sosa is able to be
in the lineup after having a CAT scan following a nasty beaning on Sunday,
the 20th, which broke his helmet.

The Yankees continue their winning ways with an 8-3 victory over the Angels
on the 100th anniversary of their 1st game. New York is off to the best
start in its history with a 17-3 record. The team's starting pitchers are
now 15-0 on the year.

2004
The Diamondbacks defeat the Brewers, 10-9, in 15 innings. Danny Bautista paces
Arizona's 20-hit attack with 5 safeties, including a double, 2 HRs and 5 RBIs.

2006
The Brewers shut out the Reds, 11-0. Bill Hall, Damian Miller, Brady Clark,
J.J. Hardy and Prince Fielder all go deep in the bottom fourth frame at
Miller Park, making the Brewers the fifth team to hit five home runs in one
inning. Milwaukee joins the 1966 Twins, the 1939 Yankees, the 1949 Phillies
and the 1961 Giants to establish the major league mark. Four of the homers
today are off of Brandon Claussen, tying another record. Fielder's is off
reliever Chris Hammond.

Arizona takes a 5-0 lead against Los Angeles and hangs on for a 5-4 win. Chad
Tracy is 4 for 4 with 3 doubles for the Diamondbacks. Kenny Lofton of the
Dodgers joins Steve Finley of the Giants as the only active players with
100 career triples when he hits a three-bagger. Lofton is playing for his
10th team, just the 10th major-leaguer to do so. He joins Todd Zeile and
Tommy Davis as the only position players to work for that many.

2007
The Red Sox become the fifth team in big league history to hit four
consecutive homeruns in an inning when Manny Ramirez, J.D. Drew, Mike
Lowell and Jason Varitek all go deep with two outs in the third inning at
Fenway off Yankee starter Chase Wright, who becomes only the second hurler
to allow a team to accomplish the feat off one pitcher. J.D. Drew was also
part of the quartet of the 2006 Dodgers who were the fourth major league
team to connect for four straight round trippers in one frame.

2008
In a scheduling oddity, both New York big league teams play in Chicago with
the Mets playing the Cubs in a matinee, and the Yankees taking on the White
Sox in a night game. This unusual occurrence is the first time in 11+ years
that two teams from one city have played in another city on the same date
and may have been necessitated by the Pope's week-end visit to the Bronx,
whose appearance included a mass at Yankee Stadium two days ago.

Striking out Nationals second baseman Felipe Lopez on his signature
split-finger fastball, John Smoltz becomes the 16th pitcher in big league
history to achieve 3,000 career strikeouts. In the 6-0 Braves loss to
Washington at Turner Field, the Atlanta ace fans 10 batters for the 45th
time in his 20-year career.

2010
The Yankees turn their first triple play in 42 years when Alex Rodriguez steps
on third to start a 5-4-3 around-the-horn play that results in three outs in
a 4-2 loss to the A's in Oakland. The team's last triple killing occurred
in June of 1968, on a 1-5-3 ground ball hit by Minnesota's John Roseboro,
a play started by pitcher Dooley Womack, continued by third baseman Bobby
Cox, and finished by Mickey Mantle who was playing first base.

With a 20-0 rout of Pittsburgh at PNC Park, the Brewers hand the Pirates
their most-lopsided loss in the 124-year history of the franchise. The
victory completes a three-game sweep of the Bucs in which the Brew Crew
outscored their opponents, 36-1.

Magglio Ordonez of Detroit scores his 1000th career run in the 3rd inning
on a Carlos Guillen ground out against the Los Angeles Angels. Ordonez
becomes the 303rd player to reach this mark.
