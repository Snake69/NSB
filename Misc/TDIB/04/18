At the Baker Bowl, Brooklyn's Jimmy Sheckard has 3 triples against the

1906
Eleven days after the start of the PCL season, a great 70-second earthquake
in San Francisco and the fire which follows destroys Recreation Park, home
of the San Francisco Seals as well as the offices of the PCL. The Seals
(9-2) are leading the league. Oakland C Pat Donohue reportedly breaks both
his legs when he jumps from a hotel window during the quake (Spalding's
PCL Date Book), but he will recover to debut with the Boston Red Sox in May.

LA Angeles (PCL) owner James Morley, who had made several unsuccessful
attempts to wreck the league, disbands his team without the consent of the
league. His lease at Chute Park is up on May 15, and the owners had refused
to extend it; he will end up selling the team to local businessmen a day
before the expiration. With telegraph service down, PCL president Bert
cannot immediately inform the Angels' players that Morley acted without
the consent of the league, and several players leave for the East. Fresno
and LA will resume play on April 26 and will play each other in one of two
cities for the next three weeks.

to win 4-0. Dick Rudolph takes the loss. It is Pete's first shutout of the
year; 15 will follow.

The Nationals top the Red Sox, 4-2, for Washington's first win in Boston
since 1914.

1918
With two Tigers on base in the 9th (Ossie Vitt on 2B and Babe Ellison on
1B), Cleveland CF Tris Speaker turns an unassisted double play to seal the
Indians win, 6-2. He traps a fly ball in the 9th and runs in to tag out

a career record for outfielders. Stan Coveleski is the Indian winner today.

In the opener in St. Louis, Hippo Vaughn pitches the Cubs to a 6-4 win

town boy Babe Ruth slugs four homers in four at-bats as the Red Sox win
12-3. Babe walks his other 2 times up.

1922
Willie Kamm makes his debut for the White Sox in a 6-5 loss at Cleveland. He
hits a double and handles 2 chances in the field. The first $100,000 priced
minor league player (bought from the San Francisco Seals), Kamm will be
voted by Chicago fans the all-time White Sox 3B.

1923
At South Field on Columbia's campus in New York City, a collegian hurler
strikes out seventeen batters to establish a school record, but loses the
game due to wildness to Williams, 5-1. The young southpaw, whose name is
Lou Gehrig, will become better known for his hitting,

On a balmy spring day, the debut of Yankee Stadium is a huge success with an
announced attendance of 74,217. Another 25,000 are turned away. Police arrest
two for scalping:  one man for trying to sell a $1.10 grandstand ticket for
$1.25 and another tries to get $1.50. Governor Al Smith throws out the first
ball. Bob Shawkey, aided by Babe Ruth's 3-run clout in the 3rd inning (the
park's first homerun), beats Howard Ehmke and the Red Sox 4-1. Ruth hits
the first homerun in the Stadium and also makes the first error. Shawkey
allows 3 hits, including a run-scoring triple in the 7th by former Yank Norm
McMillan. The new $2.5 million ballpark is the first to feature three decks.

In Philadelphia, the A's beat the Senators, 3-1. The big blow is Jimmy

1925
Charles Ebbets, Dodgers president, dies of a heart attack in his
Waldorf-Astoria apartment on the morning of the opener at Ebbets Field, won
by New York 7-1 before 25,000. Both teams wear black arm bands and line up
before the game in silent tribute. No NL games will be played on the 21st,
the day of Ebbets funeral. At the rainy funeral, Ed McKeever, the new club
president, will catch a cold that turns into pneumonia. He dies on May
27th. Manager Wilbert Robinson will take on the job of president as well.

with a 3-run homer as the two teams combine for 28 hits. Red Lucas tops
Pat Malone for the win.

1929
After two cancellations of their season start - their first ever - the Yankees
open against the Red Sox before 40,000 at the Stadium, winning 7-3. Judge
Landis presents diamond-studded watches to the New York players in honor of
their championship season in 1928. New York Starter George Pipgras allows
just 3 hits in 5 1/3 innings, but walks 9. Reliever Fred Heimach then pitches
hitless ball to preserve the win. In his first at-bat against Boston's Red
Ruffing, the newly wed (the previous day) Babe hits a HR and as he rounds 2nd
base, he doffs his cap to his bride, Claire Hodgson, in the stands. Gehrig
adds a HR in the 6th, off Milt Gaston. With their postponements the Yankees
become the second team to wear numbers on uniforms giving the Indians the
distinction of being first to don the digits. New York's numbers are assigned
based on the order in the lineup. Thus Earle Combs wore #1, Mark Koenig #2,
Babe Ruth #3, Lou Gehrig #4, Bob Meusel #5, Tony Lazzeri #6, Leo Durocher
#7, Johnny Grabowski #8, Benny Bengough #9, and Bill Dickey #10 (#'s 8-10
are all catchers) rounding out the starting line-up. Today's win goes to
Pipgras #14, with Heimach #17 picking up the save.

In Philadelphia, the twice-deferred opener unfolds before a frigid 6,000 with
the Giants handing the Quakers an 11-9 loss. For the first time in 15 years,
the Giants dress at their hotel and taxi to the ball park. Lefty O'Doul
bangs a pair of homers for Philley, while Hurst and Larry Benton, in relief
of winning pitcher Hubbell, add round trippers for New York. Benton's comes
in the Giants' 6-run 9th, when the New Yorkers twice pull off successful
double steals. Each time Phils catcher Virgil Davis fires the ball into CF.

1931
Cleveland's Joe Vosmik leads the Indians to an 11-2 thumping of the White
Sox with a single, 3 doubles and triple. Mel Harder is the winner.

Rip Collins' ML debut is less than auspicious. Sent up to pinch hit for Paul
Derringer with the bases loaded, the Cubs bring in lefty Bud Teachout. Gabby
Street then yanks Collins for Pepper Martin. The Cards win, 7-5.

1934
The Giants tip the Phils, 2-1, but almost lose Bill Terry in the process. In
the 7th, with a runner on 1B, a Phillie batter lines a hit off the right-field
wall at the Polo Grounds. Mel Ott's quick play of the carom and throw to
the cut off man, Travis Jackson, holds the lead runner at 3B. Jackson,
noticing the runner at 1B taking a wide turn, rifles the ball to first, but
it hits the surprised Terry in the face knocking him down. Terry recovers
to play tomorrow.

1935
Detroit's Jo Jo White ties an AL record with 5 walks as two White Sox pitchers
hand out 12 walks. The last walk, by reliever Joe Vance in his ML debut,
forces in the winning run in the 9th as the Tigers win, 5-4.

1938
At Fenway Park, Jim Bagby Jr becomes the 7th pitcher this century to make
his debut as an Opening Day pitcher. Bagby gives up 4 runs to the Yankees
in 6 innings of work, leaving with a 4-2 deficit. But in the bottom of
the 6th, the Sox pound Red Ruffing and reliever Joe Vance for six runs,
all charged to Red, to win, 8-4. Bagby is given the win, with Ruffing the
loser. Archie McKain pitches the last 3 innings allowing just one Yankee
hit. Ben Chapman has the game's only homer in the 2nd inning.

The Cards release vet Johnny Cooney acquired last October 4 in the Leo
Durocher trade. Cooney will sign tomorrow with the Bees.

1939
Red Barber calls the action in the first regular-season Dodger game ever
to be broadcast in Brooklyn, a 7-3 loss to New York. The future Hall of
Fame announcer was brought in from Cincinnati by the team's new president,

hits a homerun.

1944
All 16 ML teams see action on Opening Day. But Bobby Doerr, Tex Hughson and
Mort Cooper are the only established stars still on the wartime rosters. A
potential star among the new crop of rookies is George Kell, now Connie
Mack's 3B, who last year with Lancaster (Inter-State League) led all minor
league hitters with a .396 average.

In Washington, Vice President Wallace throws out the first ball and the A's
then nip the Senators, 3-2, in 12 innings. The A's Connie Mack celebrates

Stephens matching homers.

1945
In a 7-1 victory over the Tigers, the Browns' Pete Gray, playing with one arm,
makes his major league debut with one hit in four at-bats. The 30-year-old

riding on a farmer's wagon and his limb become entangled in the spokes of
one of the wheels.

in the 5th when they steal 4 bases with Reiser stealing 2B and home.

At St. Louis, Stan Musial has a double and homer to drive in 2 runs as the
Cards beat the Pirates, 4-2. A bright spot for the Bucs is Ralph Kiner's
first ML homer, off Howie Pollet, in the 8th. It is the first run Pollet
has allowed after 35 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings:  he finished 1943
with 3 shutouts and 28 scoreless innings. The Cards go from white to red at
3B, as Schoendienst, a left fielder last season, replaces Whitey Kurowski,
rusty after his holdout.

the American Baseball Guild, an organization for players. The organization
will seek a minimum salary of $6,500, binding arbitration, and a share of

which he will win the IL batting championship at .349.

1947
The Giants shell the Dodgers, 10-4, with Jackie Robinson hitting his first
homerun, off Dave Koslo, in the loss. On-deck batter George Shuba shakes
Jackie Robinson's hand as the rookie crosses home plate. The gesture becomes
known as the 'Handshake for the Century' when the white player publicly
acknowledges the accomplishment of his new black teammate. In a sign of
things to come this year, the Giants counter with 6 homers - 2 apiece by
Bobby Thomson and Bill Rigney, and one apiece by Johnny Mize and Willard
Marshall. Scout Burt Shotton is the surprise choice to replace Leo Durocher:
he participates in the pre game flag raising and then manages the team.

Sacramento's Tony Freitas, 39, wins his 200th PCL game, beating Oakland,
4-2. Freitas, who set a PCL record with 6 straight 20-win seasons, will
finish his career in 1950 (0-1) with 342 minor league wins and 25 in the
majors. Retroactively, SABR will name him the minor league's greatest pitcher.

he goes 2 for 4 with a homer. Spahn is the winning pitcher.

President Harry Truman throws out 2 balls at the Washington opener - one
left-handed and the other right-handed - then watches the Senators beat
the A's 8-7. When rain starts falling in the 6th, he puts on a raincoat
and remains to the end.

The Indians release veteran Ken Keltner. He signs with the Red Sox the same
day but is released on June 6th.

At Fenway, Happy Chandler gives Ted Williams his MVP Award, and then
Governor Paul Dever tosses out the first ball. To the delight of 31,822 fans,
Boston rips starter Allie Reynolds with a five-run 4th inning to drive the
Chief from the game and take a 9-0 over the Yankees. But the Yanks score
four in the 6th off Mel Parnell and then, down 10-4, New York unloads for
nine runs in the 8th. 2B Billy Martin (2 for 2) becomes the first player in
history to get two base hits in one inning in his first ML game. He doubles
against Mel Parnell on his first at bat in the 8th inning, and singles off
Al Papai. Walt Masterson gives up Tommy Henrich's 2nd triple of the game
before giving way to four more Sox hurlers. Boo Ferriss, pitching in his
last game, allows the last two runs in the 9th inning as the Yanks chalk up
a 15-10 win, the biggest blown lead the Sox have ever had at Fenway (June 4,
1989, they'll blow a 10-run lead at home). DiMaggio, Berra, Vern Stephens,
and Doerr each have three hits. Don Johnson is the winner, his last one

1952
On Opening Day in Brooklyn, Willie Mays is knocked unconscious when
he smashes into the Ebbets Field wall after chasing pinch hitter Bob
Morgan's seventh-inning, two-out base-loaded line drive into the gap in
left field. All three Dodger base runners cross the plate, but do not score
when the motionless Giants center fielder comes to his feet and jogs into
the dugout, apparently unhurt, having held onto the ball after making an
amazing catch for the third out to end the inning.

In their home Opener before 29,874, Pittsburgh's Bob Friend shuts out the
Reds, 5-0, on 5 hits. It is the 2nd win in a row for the Pirates, and they
won't have a win streak longer than two games all season, a 20th century
ML record low.

1953
The White Sox collect 4 hits, one more than the Indians, but the 2 teams
combine for 26 walks, 4 short of the ML record set on May 9, 1916. Six

Grunwald relieves in the 4th with the Giants ahead 3-0. Getting just one
batter out he gives up a single to Don Mueller, a double to Monte Irvin, a

Dodgers shortstop Maury Wills singles to center off future Hall of Famer
Robin Roberts becoming the first batter to hit on artificial turf in a major
league game. The Astrodome's new playing surface, originally called Chemgrass

will join the Indians in a trade later during the season.

1970
Denny Doyle's first-inning single is the only hit allowed by Nolan Ryan
when he blanks the Phillies at Shea Stadium, 7-0. The 23-year-old Mets

Seaver will break the short-lived record whiffing 19 Padres later in the week.

The Mets Nolan Ryan gives up a leadoff single to Denny Doyle, then shuts
out the Phillies without another hit. Ryan fans 15 in the 7-0 triumph. For
the light-hitting Doyle, it is the first of three one-hitters in which he
has the lone hit.
