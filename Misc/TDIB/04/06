a 43-15 win over the El Paso Longhorns.

1939
A howling windstorm of 50 mph does not deter the Red Sox and Reds from
playing an exhibition game in Florence, South Carolina but the weather and
the rock-hard infield results in the game being called in the 9th inning
when all 54 baseballs have disappeared. "Grounders were actually blown
off the ground and over the outfield fences," observed Lou Smith in the
Cincinnati Enquirer. The score is 18-18 when the game ends with both teams
covered with grime.

President Richard Nixon is delayed and is unable to throw the ceremonial
first pitch in the Senators home opener at RFK Stadium. His son-in-law,
David Eisenhower, the son of the former president throws out the first
pitch. In this traditional baseball season opener, Detroit's Mickey Lolich
shuts out the Senators, 5-0. Dick Bosman is the losing pitcher.

In the last home opener at Crosley Field, the Reds top the Expos, 5-1,
behind Jim Merritt. It is the first win for manager Sparky Anderson. The
Reds have 3 homers in the 4th when Lee May, Bernie Carbo and Bobby Tolan
connect. It is Carbo's first ML hit. Joe Sparma takes the loss.

1971
Willie Mays, a month shy of his 40th birthday, homers (his 629th) on the
first pitch he sees in a 4-0 Opening Day Giants win over the Padres. He

first 4 games of the season, a ML record. Juan Marichal wins on a 5-hitter.

At Fenway Park the Red Sox take their second straight Opener against the
Yankees, winning 3-1. Boston's Ray Culp allows 5 hits in 9 innings in
winning over Stan Bahnsen, who gives up 2 runs in 7 innings. Reggie Smith
has 3 hits and his throw to the plate in the 8th gets the last out.

Before 39,712 chilled fans in Pittsburgh the Pirates win their Opener,
4-2, over the Phils. Dock Ellis is the winner, laying down 3 sac bunts,
and getting help with 4 Phillie errors.

Before 41,121 at Chicago Billy Williams clubs a 10th inning homer off Bob
Gibson to give the Cubs a 2-1 win over the Cards. Joe Torre's homer off
Fergie Jenkins is the only Cardinal score.

At Houston Claude Osteen allows 4 hits and rookie Bill Buckner's homer
accounts for all the scoring as the Dodgers beat the Astros, 2-0. Don Wilson
takes the loss. Osteen was 6-0 last year against Houston.

The Mets win their first opener ever at Shea Stadium, beating the Expos,
4-2, in 5 innings. Heavy rain and wind cuts the contest short. Tom Seaver
is the winner over Morton.

1972
For the first time, the major leagues failed to open on schedule because
of a player strike, which started April 1. The traditional season opener
between Houston and Cincinnati was canceled and a total of 86 games were
lost before the strike was settled.

1973
On Opening Day at Three Rivers Stadium in front of a record crowd of 51,695
the Pirates retire Roberto Clemente's uniform number 21 posthumously. The
Pittsburgh right fielder died in a plane crash on New Year's Eve attempting
to bring relief aid to earthquake-stricken Managua, Nicaragua. On this day
the Pirates beat St. Louis, 7-5, with a 9th inning rally.

Richard Nixon becomes the first president to throw the ceremonial first
pitch on Opening Day in a contest held outside of Washington D.C. The
commander-in-chief does the honors before Nolan Ryan and the Angels beat
the Royals at Anaheim Stadium, 3-2.

At the Oakland Coliseum Tony Oliva becomes the first designated hitter ever
to homer. The Twins DH first inning two-run round-tripper off future Hall
of Famer Catfish Hunter helps to defeat the A's, 8-3.

At Fenway Park the first ball is thrown out by Ed Folger, a Boston Red
Sox farm hand who had his legs amputated last September following a farm
accident. In the top of the first inning, Ron Blomberg of the New York
Yankees becomes the first regular season designated hitter in major league
history when he faces righthander Luis Tiant. Blomberg walks with the bases
loaded and winds up 1 for 3 in the 15-5 loss to Boston. Sox DH Orlando
Cepeda goes 0 for 6 but Carlton Fisk strokes two homers, one a grand slam,
in the 20-hit Boston assault. Second baseman Doug Griffin notches four hits
for Boston, which overcomes a 3-0 deficit by scoring eight runs to chase
Mel Stottlemyre by the third inning. The Yanks record eight hits off Tiant,
five by the Alou brothers, Matty and Felipe.

At Baltimore, Dave McNally fires a three-hitter as the Orioles roll over
the Brewers, 10-0. Don Baylor has three doubles, a homer and 4 RBIs while
Brooks Robinson bangs two homers for 4 RBIs.

1974
The Bronx Bombers begin their two year stint at Shea Stadium before a crowd
of 20,744, where the team will compile a 172-150 (.534) record during the
renovations to their Stadium. 12-year-old Teddy Kennedy Jr, flanked by his
father and Mayor Abe Beame, tosses out the first ball. Missing from the
ceremony is George Steinbrenner, indicted two days ago for illegal campaign
contributions. Greg Nettle's two-run homer in the 4th off the Indians
Gaylord Perry opens the scoring and the Yanks score 4 more times to win,
6-1. Charlie Spikes scores the only Cleveland run in the 9th following a
triple off starter and complete-game winner Mel Stottlemyre. Perry, who is
warned once for an illegal pitch, is the loser today, but he will win his
next 15 decisions. The 'other' NY fans cheer loudly when the scoreboard
posts the Mets' 5-4 loss in Philadelphia.

At Veterans Stadium Phillies Mike Schmidt hits a ninth inning two-run home run
off Tug McGraw to beat the Mets on Opening Day, 5-4. The walk-off homer is the
first of the league-leading 36 dingers the third baseman will hit this season.

The Twins set a team record for runs rolling over the Royals, 23-6. Twenty
of the runs are earned.

1975
The Astros purchase P Joe Niekro from the Braves.

1977
For the second time in nine years, a new franchise makes its major league
debut in Seattle. The Seattle Mariners lose to Frank Tanana and the Angels
7-0. Joe Rudi is 3 for 4 with a homer and 4 RBIs. The loser for the M's
is Diego Segui, who pitched the Seattle Pilots Opener in 1969, a 4-3 loss
at Anaheim. Segui is the only player to appear for both the Pilots and
the Mariners.

Despite a snowfall of 4 inches this morning, the Reds open against the
Padres, winning 5-3. The snow, which stops falling at 11:30, is cleared
out of the stadium a half hour before the game's start.

1978
In a rain-delayed season opener in Cincinnati, Houston's Terry Puhl leads
off with a homer against Tom Seaver, who allows 5 runs in 3 innings. But
led by Joe Morgan's pair of two-run doubles and a homer, the Reds prevail,
11-9. In the bottom of the 7th, with Morgan on 3B and George Foster on 1B,
Dan Driessen strikes out and Foster is caught stealing 2B, Ferguson to
Roger Metzger. Morgan tries to score on the play and is thrown out on the
return. According to Retrosheet, this is apparently the first triple play
begun with a strikeout. In 1982, the Twins will start a triple play with
a strikeout.

1979
The Astros beat the Braves 2-1. Atlanta loses the services of Rookie of
the Year 3B Bob Horner for the next 32 games due to an ankle injury.

At Baltimore, manager Earl Weaver wins his 1,000th game as a skipper, as
the O's open with a 5-3 win over the White Sox. Jim Palmer allows 3 hits
for the win. Rich Dauer, who ended the 1978 season by driving in a run in
10 straight games, adds another game to the streak with an infield out.

1982
A freak heavy spring snow storm brings subfreezing temperatures across
the northeast and midwest and causes the postponement of home openers for
the Yankees, Tigers, White Sox, Brewers, Indians, Phillies and Pirates.
In New York a foot of snow cancels the Yankees opener with the Rangers at
the Stadium. Tomorrow's game with Texas and the first two with the White
Sox will also be canceled because of snow and ice. With 2 games snowed out
in Chicago, the Red Sox will return tomorrow to Winter Haven, Florida.

The largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in Minnesota - 52,279 -
turns out for the inaugural game at the brand-new Hubert H. Humphrey
Metrodome. Twins rookie 3B Gary Gaetti goes 4 for 4 with a pair of homeruns
and is thrown out trying to stretch a triple into a 3rd round tripper. Seattle
wins 11-7.

The Reds sell P Mike LaCoss, 4-7 in 1981, to the Astros.

1987
Los Angeles Dodgers General manager Al Campanis, a former teammate of Jackie
Robinson, appears on the ABC news program, Nightline to discuss the progress
of racial integration of baseball on the fortieth anniversary of Robinson's
first game. When asked why more African-Americans have not become managers or
executives, Campanis states that Blacks may lack certain qualities for those
jobs, drawing the ire of host Ted Koppel. Campanis was fired two days later.

1988
The Blue Jays' reluctant designated hitter, George Bell, follows up his three
homerun Opening Day performance going 5 for 5 (three singles and two doubles)
leading Toronto over the Royals, 11-4. Considered a defensive liability,
last year's American League MVP will return to left field full time.

1989
At Riverfront Stadium, Dodgers' hurler Orel Hershiser's scoreless-inning
streak ends at 59. With two outs in the bottom of the first, Todd Benzinger's
single scores Barry Larkin, who had been picked off after getting a base hit
to lead off the game, but was safe on the "Bulldog's" throwing error. The
Reds win, 4-3.

In the Royals 3-2 win over the Blue Jays, Kansas City batters combine for
just 20 at-bats. This is one shy of the ML record for fewest at-bats, which
Baltimore set on September 12, 1964, versus Kansas City. Toronto allows 8
walks, made 3 DPs, and KC has a sac and 2 sac flies.

1991
The Braves trade right-hander Mike Thompson to the Reds in exchange for
utility player Terry Crowley. Thompson will never throw another pitch in
the major leagues, and Crowley will be released by Atlanta after appearing
in just seven games.

1992
On Opening Day in front of a full house of 55,918 at Seattle's Kingdome
the Rangers score nine runs with two outs in the top of the eighth inning
and hold on to beat the Mariners, 12-10. Texas had been trailing 8-3 before
the late inning barrage.

A crowd of 44,568 sees the Orioles defeat the Indians, 2-0, as they play
the 1st game ever in Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Rick Sutcliffe hurls the
shutout for Baltimore.

Toronto's Jack Morris sets a record with his 13th consecutive Opening Day
start, as he goes all the way in defeating the Tigers, 4-2.

Mets reliever Jeff Innis is credited with the win over the Cardinals in
NY's 4-2 Opening Day victory. In 1991, Innis became the only pitcher in
baseball history to appear in at least 60 games with neither a win nor a save.

1993
In his NL debut, Cubs P Juan Guzman takes a perfect game into the 8th inning
against Atlanta, finally settling for a 1-hit, 1-0 victory. Otis Nixon's
single with 2 outs in the 9th is the Braves' only hit.

The Phils Mitch Williams changes his uniform number from 28 to 99, the
highest number in history. He picks up a save today and vows to throw at
99 mph every outing.

1995
The Blue Jays acquire David Cone (16-5) from the Royals in exchange for
infielders Chris Stynes and Anthony Medrano, and P David Sinnes.

The Braves obtain OF Marquis Grissom from the Expos in exchange for
outfielders Roberto Kelly and Tony Tarasco.

1996
Chan Ho Park becomes the first South Korean to win in the majors, pitching
4 scoreless innings in relief of injured starter Ramon Martinez as the
Dodgers beat the Cubs 3-1 at Wrigley.

Padres pitching prospect Matt LaChappa, 20, suffers a massive heart attack
while warming up for the Rancho Cucamunga Quakes.

Warming up in the outfield before the Indians' game with Toronto, Albert
Belle heaves a ball at photographer Tony Tomsic, hitting him. Belle contends
that it wasn't deliberate, even though it was his second throw near Tomsic,
and even though he warned the photog not to snap his picture. The league
will open an investigation in two weeks and Tomsic will file a law suit on
December 12th. The Indians win the game, defeating the Blue Jays, 5-3.

Terry Pendleton hits a game-ending homer leading off the 10th to give
Florida a 1-0 win over the Giants. Mark Dewey, in relief of starter Mark
Leiter who went 9 innings, serves up the gopher.

Tiger CF Melvin Nieves bangs two doubles, a triple and a homer as the
Tigers top the A's, 6-1. Nieves was acquired from the Padres in a spring
training trade.

The Twins hand the Orioles their first loss of the year, topping the O's,
8-3. Cal Ripken fumbles a grounder in the 5th inning stopping his errorless
streak at 74 games.

1997
With a 3-2 loss to Houston at the Astrodome, the Cardinals remain winless
after the first six games of the season. It is the Redbirds worst start in
the 106-year history of the franchise.

1998
Houston trounces Colorado, 13-4, despite 5 hits by Rockies' RF Dante
Bichette. Jeff Bagwell homers and drives home 3 runs for the Astros.

Commission to sell shares of the team to the public. Plans are made for an
initial offering of 4 million shares.

1999
The Braves defeat the Phillies, 11-3, behind Greg Maddux. Maddux hits a HR
and a 2-run single in Atlanta's 8-run 4th inning becoming the first pitcher
since Todd Stottlemyre in 1996 to get 2 hits in the same inning.

The U.S. government garnishes Denny McLain's pension in order to reimburse
the pension fund from which he was convicted of laundering money. McLain
was recently divorced and under the terms of the settlement, all of the
assets went to his wife, including his pension, while McLain got all of the
debts. But a federal judge overruled that and ordered that all of McLain's
pension benefits be used to reimburse his victims.

2000
The Pirates defeat the Astros, 10-1, as OF Brian Giles goes 5 for 5,
including 2 homers and a triple. Pittsburgh P Francisco Cordova does not
give up a hit to Houston until 1 man is out in the 8th inning.

The Royals defeat the Blue Jays, 9-3, as rookie P Chad Durbin allows
just 1 hit in 6 innings in his 1st big league start, and 2nd big league
appearance. The Royals score all 9 of their runs in the 6th inning.

2001
In the home opener at Veteran Stadium, Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Bunning's
number 14 jersey is retired. Kentucky's Republican U.S. senator, who compiled
a 224-184 in his 17-year career pitching for the Tigers, Phillies, Pirates
and Dodgers, joins Richie Ashburn (1), Robin Roberts (36), Steve Carlton (32)
and Mike Schmidt (20) as the fifth player to have his number retired by the
Phillies. The game is delayed an hour and 51 minutes by rain. The Cubs beat
the Phillies 3-2. Cubs reliever Todd Von Poppel strikes out all 5 batters he
faces while Jeff Fassero gets his 2nd save in 2 nights. Previously, his last
save was June 30, 1993. Julio Zuleta hits the first Cub homer of the year.

The Brewers, after a disappointing 0-4 start on the road, get into the
winner's circle in front of a crowd of 42,024 including President George
W. Bush as they beat the Reds, 5-4, in the major league debut of Miller
Park. Bush tosses out the first ball. Sean Casey hits the park's first homer,
but Richie Sexson's 435-foot homerun in the eighth inning breaks a 4-4
deadlock giving Milwaukee its first win. Reliever David Weathers gets the win.

The Tigers score 8 runs in the 6th inning to take a 9-5 lead, then hold on to
defeat the White Sox, 10-9, in 10 innings. Tony Clark has 2 hits in the 6th,
including a grand slam. Thomas, Durham and Valentin hit solo HRs for the Sox.

Diamondbacks. St. Louis 2B Fernando Vina gets 5 hits, including a triple.

2002
Highly touted Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii makes his ML debut and
pitches 5 1/3 scoreless innings, striking out 10, in LA's 9-2 win over
the Rockies. Brian Jordan backs Ishii with a grand slam to give the loss
to Jason Jennings. Relief pitcher Jesse Orosco of the Los Angeles Dodgers
scores just the third run of his 4-decade major-league career. He last
scored while playing for the Mets on July 22, 1986.

The White Sox roll by the Kansas City Royals, winning 14-0. Mark Buehrle
allows 5 hits in 6 innings pitched. Paul Konerko has 3 runs and 3 RBIs,
and Magglio Ordonez has 3 RBIs. Trailing 9-0 in the 8th, the Royals bring
in Miguel Asencio, the youngest pitcher in the majors. Making his ML debut,
Asencio walks Kenny Lofton on 4 pitches and does the same to the next three
batters. He leaves having thrown 16 pitches.

The Mets score 9 runs in the 9th inning - 8 off John Smoltz - to break a
2-2 tie and defeat the Braves, 11-2. Rey Ordonez' bases-loaded double is
the big blow as the Mets have 15 at-bats in the 9th. It is the most runs
they've ever scored in the frame.

2003
The White Sox score 9 runs in the 8th inning to rally for a 10-2 win over
the Tigers. Detroit becomes the 1st team since the 1962-63 Mets to lose
their first 6 games of the season in consecutive years.

The Pirates shut out the Phillies, 2-0, behind Kris Benson. Philadelphia's
Jim Thome goes 0 for 4, ending his streak of reaching base safely in 60
straight games, the longest streak in the majors since Mark McGwire reached
base in 62 in a row in 1995-96.

Alfonso Soriano and Nick Johnson hit back-to-back homers to start the game
as the Yankees beat Tampa Bay, 10-5. Rogers Clemens wins victory #295.

Shea Hillenbrand has a homer, 2 doubles and 6 RBIs to pace the Red Sox to
a 12-2 win over the Orioles. Nomar Garciaparra adds a walk, double, triple
and homer, and scores 4 times as the Sox jump on nemesis Rodrigo Lopez,
4-0 versus Boston last year.

2004
In an on-line poll in which nearly 8,000 fans participated, "Still, We
Believe:  The Boston Red Sox Movie" is selected as the title of a documentary
about the 2003 season. Other choices offered by the team and Boston Globe
web sites included "This Is the Year," "The Ecstasy and the Agony" and
"Always the Bridesmaid" in addition to fan's wry suggestion of "I Know What
You Did Last Summer, I Wish I Didn't Know What You Did Last Fall."

Adrian Beltre becomes the 36th player in baseball history to hit 100 homeruns
before the age of 25. The Dodger third baseman joins Cal Ripken Jr and Lou
Gehrig to have exactly 100 homers on their 25th birthday.

On Opening Day at Bank One Ballpark, Diamondbacks' outfielder Luis Gonzalez
and Rockies' second baseman Luis Gonzalez each homered making it only
the second time in major league history players with the same first and
last names homered in the same game. The first occurrence happened when
Ken Griffey Jr, and his dad, Ken Griffey, playing for the Mariners, hit
back-to-back homers off Angels' hurler Kirk McCaskill in 1990.

It took a nearly a half of a century but Hank Aaron is finally surpassed in
an unlikely category. "Hammerin' Hank" will no longer be the first player
named alphabetically in baseball history books when Giants' pitcher David
Aardsma makes his major-league debut against the Astros. The Giants down
the Astros, 7-5.

The World Champion Florida Marlins open their 2004 season with a 4-3 win
over the Montreal Expos. The game marks the first time that 2 WS MVPs oppose
each other on Opening Day, with 2003 winner Josh Beckett going for Florida
and 1997 winner Livan Hernandez on the mound for Montreal. Like Beckett,
Hernandez was a member of the Marlins when he won his World Series MVP.

The Mets open their season with a 7-2 win over the Braves. SS Kazuo Matsui,
making his American baseball debut, opens the game with a home run on the
first pitch from Russ Ortiz, becoming only the 20th player in baseball
history to homer on the first major league pitch he sees. Matsui adds a
pair of doubles and two walks in his debut. He is the 3rd player in Met
history to homer in his first AB, joining Mike Fitzgerald and Benny Ayala.

2005
At Philadelphia's Citizen Ballpark, the Nationals win their first game
representing Washington D.C. by beating the Phillies, 7-3. The historic
win features the Nats center fielder Brad Wilkerson hitting for the cycle
for the second time in his career. He also accomplished the feat against
the Pirates on June 24, 2003.

2006
Using his newly perfected knuckleball, Texas P R.A. Dickey ties a post-1900
major league record by surrendering six HRs to the Tigers in a 10-6 Detroit
victory. The only ML pitcher to give up more homers was Charlie Sweeney
of the St. Louis Maroons who allowed seven to the Detroit Wolverines (AA)
on June 12, 1886. Detroit clouts 7 round-trippers in the contest, and sets
a major league record with 15 homers in their first three games, breaking
the mark of 10, set by the 1998 Mariners. The Tigers set a team record for
any 3-game span, breaking the mark of 14, set in 1997.

The Phillies lose their 3rd straight game to the Cardinals, 4-2, and
Jimmy Rollins loses his 38-game hitting streak as he is held hitless in 4
ABs. Rollins hit .379 (64 for 169) during his two-season streak and fell
just 7 games short of the all-time record of 45 held by Willie Keeler. "Wee
Willie" got a hit in the final game of the 1896 season then posted at least
one safety in 44 straight games to begin 1897. Rollins joins Vada Pinson
(31 games 1965-66), Ron LeFlore (31 games 1975-76) and Hal Morris (32 games
1996-97) as the only players since 1960 with 30-gamers over two years.

Devil Rays P Mark Hendrickson hurls a complete game 3-hit shutout defeating
the Orioles, 2-0. It is the 1st complete game shutout for TB since 2003. The
streak of 349 consecutive games without a complete game shutout is 2nd in
AL history behind the 1994-96 Brewers (386).

Pedro Feliz honors three former major-leaguers (including his own manager,
Felipe Alou) when he drives in Barry Bonds, Moises Alou and Lance Niekro with
a bases-clearing double during the Giants' six-run 3rd against the Braves'
off of Jorge Sosa. According to Dave Vincent, Feliz is the first major-leaguer
in the last 49 years to drive in three sons of ex-major-leaguers on the same
play. Further research reveals that it is only the 11th time since 1957 that
three sons of big leaguers were on base at the same time. Doing some record
setting of their own in the 6-4 loss, Brave batterymates Brian McCann (C)
and Jorge Sosa (P) became only the 11th such duo to hit back-to-back homers
in the majors when they go yard consecutively. It is the first ML hit and
homer for Sosa, who will have two more hits, both homers, this year.

2009
In Florida's 12-6 victory over the Nationals at Dolphin Stadium, Emilio
Bonifacio hits an inside-the-park homerun, the first on Opening Day since
Red Sox outfielder Carl Yastrzemski accomplished the feat in 1968. The
round-tripper, one of four hits for the Marlins' third baseman, is the first
big league homer of his career. Bonifacio also stole three bases in the game.

Tony Clark and Felipe Lopez each homered from both sides of the plate to
lead Arizona to a 9-8 victory over Colorado.

Alfonso Soriano hit his 50th career leadoff homerun as Chicago beat
Houston 4-2.

2012
Adam Dunn tied a major league record with his eighth opening-day homerun. He
led off the sixth inning for the Chicago White Sox when he pulled a ball into
the second deck of seats in right field off Texas starter Colby Lewis. Frank
Robinson and Ken Griffey Jr are the other major leaguers who have eight
homers in openers.

2015 	
On Opening Day, the Rays retire number No. 66 in honor of their late
senior baseball adviser Don Zimmer, who passed away in June at the age of
83. 'Popeye', who was a player, coach and manager with a dozen different
teams, wore the number in his final season with the organization to represent
the number of years he worked in professional baseball.

The Mets start 41-year-old Bartolo Colon on Opening Day, much to the chagrin
of the fan base who hoped one of their young guns, Matt Harvey and Jacob
deGrom, would get the coveted assignment. The oldest pitcher ever to get the
nod on opening day in franchise history doesn't disappoint when he gives up
one run on three hits, besting Washington's $210 million ace Max Scherzer
in the team's 3-1 victory at Nationals Park.

2016
Trevor Story becomes the first major leaguer to hit a home run in each of
his first three major league games when he goes deep in the first inning
of the Rockies' 4-3 victory over the Diamondbacks at Chase Park. The 23
year-old shortstop is also the first rookie to have the round-trippers
account for each of his first big league four hits.

The Padres, with their 7-0 loss at Petco Park, become the first team to
be shut out in the first three games of the regular season, surpassing the
dubious mark set by the Browns, who opened the 1943 campaign with 26 straight
scoreless innings. San Diego also dropped their first two decisions of the
three-game series against the Dodgers, 15-0 and 3-0.
