1903
The last-place Cardinals start local college pitcher Harry Betts against
Boston, but he gives up 11 hits and walks 5, while losing 10-1. Betts'
next and last appearance in the majors will be in 1913 with the Reds.

In Cincinnati, Reds OF Mike Donlin hits 4 consecutive triples in a
doubleheader split with the Phillies. Donlin's 1st triple comes in his last
at-bat in the opener, a 12-7 loss, and three more triples in the nitecap
8-1 win. Donlin is 6 for 7 on the afternoon.

Pittsburgh's 16-game winner Ed Doheny, still suffering from bouts of
paranoia, leaves the team and is escorted home to Massachusetts by his
brother. During the World Series, Doheny will be committed to the Danvers
Insane Asylum after knocking his male nurse unconscious. At the age of 26,
his major league career is over.

1904
In the opener of a twinbill with the Reds, the Giants win, 7-5, behind Joe
McGinnity. Their 100th win, it clinches the NL pennant for New York. In
the final game of his 19-year career as an OF/C, future Hall of Famer Jim
O'Rourke, 54 years ten months old (according to research by historian Bill
Carle), catches for McGinnity. It is O'Rourke's first ML game since 1893
(Benton Stark writes that O'Rourke hit .358 in 1900, but it was not in OB)
and he is 1 for 4 and scores a run. He is the oldest to hit safely, with
Minnie Minoso, at 53 years 10 months, in second place when he hits safely
in 1976. He'll be elected to Cooperstown in 1945. The Reds come back in
the nitecap to win, 7-3 in 7 innings, beating Hooks Wiltse.

The Giants' .262 will lead the NL in team batting, 31 points below the
1900 leaders. Team batting averages have dropped since then, mainly due to:
the change from a diamond-shaped 10-inch home plate to the 5-sided 17-inch
plate after 1901; the foul-strike rule adopted in 1901; and the introduction
of the spitball and other doctored pitches in 1903.

1905
At Cincinnati, the Reds smack Brooklyn spitballer Elmer Stricklett,
winning 11-1.

1906
With an ailing battery of Doc White and Sullivan, returning after a 3-week
layoff due to an injured thumb, the White Sox thrash the Highlanders,
7-1, and move back into a tie for first place. Fielder Jones has 3 hits,
including a fence-clearing HR.

1907
The Reds' Bob Spade makes his pitching debut in a 1-0 shutout over the
Giants. He outduels Joe McGinnity, allowing just 4 hits. New York's Roger
Bresnahan is tossed by Bill Klem and will need the consent of the league
president to next play.

1908
The Cubs sweep a doubleheader at New York, 4-3 and 2-1, giving them a 90-53
record versus the Giants' 87-50.

The Pirates move to 1 1/2 games in back of Chicago and New York by edging
Brooklyn, 3-2 in 11 innings. Al Storke triples home Wagner, then scores on
an error. Tom Catterson then follows with a homer.

1909
Jimmy McAleer, one of the AL's original managers, resigns from the Browns
after 8 years, switching to Washington.

At Robison Field, the Cardinals collect 12 hits off Christy Mathewson,
but still lose to the Giants, 4-3. Fred Beebe takes the loss. It is Beebe's
14th straight loss to the Giants, establishing a ML record that'll be tied
in the 20th century by 7 pitchers.

1910
In the 2nd game of a DH at Cincinnati, Boston P George Ferguson hits a
grand slam off Jack Rowan, in the 3rd inning, as Boston beats the Reds,
7-5. It is Ferguson's only ML homer.

1911
At the age of 44, Boston Rustlers Cy Young shuts out Pittsburgh and Babe
Adams, 1-0, for his final career victory, number 511. It is Young's 2nd
shutout against the Pirates, who lost just 3 of 22 games to Boston in 1911.

Jim Scott and Frank Lange apply whitewashes to the Browns as the White Sox
win, 5-0 and 1-0.

1912
Eleven days after stealing 6 bases in a game, Eddie Collins does it
again. Included in his 6 swipes are 3B and home, as the A's beat the Browns,
8-2, in the first of two games. Collins has no steals in game 2. Collins will
end the year with 63 steals, a distant second to Clyde Milan's 88. Browns
C Jim Stephens shared the backstop a year ago (9/28/11) when 15 stolen
bases were racked up. The Browns use 3 pitchers today - Mack Allison,
Walter Brown and Roy Mitchell.

Association Park, home of the Kansas City AA baseball team, is destroyed
by fire.

1913
In the opener of a doubleheader, the A's Joe Bush tops Detroit, 4-0. In
game 2, Herb Pennock, 19, aided by Eddie Plank, blanks the Tigers, 1-0,
to clinch the AL pennant for the A's. Plank gets the win in relief.

The Phils' Pete Alexander shuts out the Cubs, 2-0, in the first of two
games with Chicago. The Phils then complete the sweep, winning, 5-1.

1914
Boston (AL) P Ray Collins hurls two complete-game victories over the Tigers,
winning by scores of 5-3 and 5-0.

At the Polo Grounds, the Cubs score 5 runs in the 1st inning against
Mathewson. It is all Larry Cheney needs, as he tosses a 3-hitter to win,
5-0. The Giants now trail the Braves by 5 games.

1915
Having loaned the Braves the use of their larger park in 1914, the Boston
Red Sox request the use of the new, larger NL park for this year's WS.

The Tigers use a 10-run 7th to beat the A's, 13-9. Reliever Joe Bush faces
9 batters to start the 7th and retires none. The A's get a HR from Bill
Bankston, his only ML roundtripper, while Wally Schang is 0 for 1 but scores
4 runs.

1916
Brooklyn's Jimmy Johnston swipes 2B, 3B and home as Rube Marquard 6-hits the
Cardinals for an 11-1 win. Brooklyn's Hack Miller makes his first appearance,
going hitless in one at-bat as a late inning replacement.

1917
In Washington, Walter Johnson fans Ty Cobb in the 1st inning, and then
laughs about it. The next time up, in the 3rd with two on, Cobb lashes an
inside-the-park homer and Detroit beats the Big Train, 4-3. It is Cobb's
only career homer off Johnson.

1920
A Chicago grand jury convenes to investigate charges that 8 White Sox
players conspired to fix the 1919 World Series.

1924
The Senators open a 2-game lead as Walter Johnson wins his 13th in a row,
8-3 over Chicago. It's his 23rd win of the year. Washington will take the
next two games in Chicago to sweep.

1925
P Burleigh Grimes of Brooklyn has only himself to blame for losing, 3-2,
to the Cubs in the 12th. While he masterfully scatters 16 hits, he not only
goes hitless at the plate but bangs into 2 double plays and, in the 11th,
a triple play. He accounts for seven outs in just three plate appearances.

The Yankees' Ben Paschal hits 2 inside-the-park homers, in an 11-6
first-game win over the White Sox at Yankee Stadium. The Sox take the
nitecap, 4-2. Paschal will have 7 homers this month, a Yankee rookie record
for September that will stand until 1998.

In a doubleheader loss (11-8 and 7-2) Ramon Herrera, a Cuban IF, makes his
debut with the Boston Red Sox. He will bat .385 in 10 games, but will hit
only .257 in 74 games in 1926. Herrera is probably the first player of this
era to play in both the major leagues and the Negro leagues.

1926
At Ebbets Field, the aging 18-year veteran outfielder Zack Wheat hits his
last homer as a Dodger, but severely pulls a muscle nearing second. The
future Hall of Famer needs to rest nearly five minutes before completing his
trip to home plate making it the longest homerun trot in major league history.

The Cardinals, led by Les Bell's ML record-tying 3 triples and a double,
roll by the Dodgers, 15-7, to increase their 1st-place lead of Cincy to 2
1/2 games. Rookie Tommy Thevenow and Jim Bottomley chip in with homeruns. For
Thevenow, it is his 2nd homer in 6 days, again an inside-the-park drive. He'll
play another 12 years - 3351 at-bats - and never hit another homer.

In Philadelphia, the A's play their first Sunday game ever, beating the
White Sox, 3-2, behind Lefty Grove. A state Supreme Court decision will
delay the next Sunday game for 8 years.

1927
Before a capacity crowd of 37,000 at Forbes Field the first place Pirates
hold off the 2nd place Giants by splitting a doubleheader. The Pirates win
the first game, 5-2, behind Ray Kremer and the Giants take the nitecap, 2-0,
behind Fred Fitzsimmons. Rogers Hornsby, managing the team in the absence
of McGraw, hits a 2-run homer, his 26th, to account for the scoring in the
second game. He also homers in the opener. Hornsby (.361) is 2nd to Paul
Waner (.384) in hitting in the NL. Lloyd Waner (.352) is 3rd.

Against the Tigers, Babe Ruth hits his 56th homer, off Ken Holloway, and
the Yankees edge Detroit, 8-7. Earl Combs adds a record three consecutive
triples in the win.

The Athletics sweep a pair from Cleveland, winning 4-3 in 13 innings, and
5-2. A's rookie Charley Bates debuts with and has 3 hits in each game,
including a triple and 2 doubles, and his hits start the rallies that
tie and win the opener. Alas, Bates will have just 3 more hits this year,
his only season in the majors.

The White Sox suffer their 12th straight loss when Red Sox PH Carlyle hits
a bases-load single in the 10th to give Boston a 2-1 win. Red Faber goes
the distance in the loss to young Danny MacFayden.

1928
Boston 1B Phil Todt hits HRs in the 7th and 8th innings as Boston beats
the Browns, 5-3. His first homer, off Ed Strelecki is Boston's 1st hit. His
2nd comes with pitcher Danny MacFayden on base.

1929
Jack Hendricks resigns as Reds manager effective at the close of the
season. The 7th place Reds will finish 68-88.

1931
In a 13-inning game at Forbes Field, Hal Finney, Pirates C, has no putouts
in a 3-2 win over Philadelphia. Paul Waner draws 5 walks, and 20 runners are
left on base, as Heine Meine wins his 19th game to tie for the lead in the NL.

At Philadelphia, the A's set a new franchise record as they win their 105th,
beating the Tigers, 8-6. Jimmie Foxx belts his 30th, a 3-run homer in the
first to pave the way for George Earnshaw's 21st win. Tiger infielder Mark
Koenig makes his 3rd mound appearance of the season, walks 6 while pitching
2 runless innings. The A's complete their season series with Detroit at 18-4.

1932
The Yanks overcome two homers by Jimmie Foxx, one a grand slam, and edge the
Athletics in 10 innings, 8-7. Foxx now has 56 homers. The Yanks' comeback
starts in the 8th inning when Gehrig hits a 2-run homer, his 33rd. Myril
Hoag's homer in the 9th ties it for NY.

The Cubs announce WS shares and snub former player-manager Rogers
Hornsby. Late-season arrival Mark Koenig gets just a half share. Hornsby
appeals to Judge Landis, arguing that he was an active player for two-thirds
of the season, and deserved a full share. Landis turns him down. In today's
contest, Cub Burleigh Grimes loses, 7-0, to Hal Smith of the Pirates. It's
Hal's first major league start and his only decision of the year.

1934
With the Cards rained out, the Giants lose, 3-2, at Boston in 11 innings. The
Cubs lose 2 games to the Pirates, 2-1 and 11-7, to drop out of the pennant
race with an 81-63 record.

1935
In the final game at Chicago, the Cubs whip the Pirates, 2-0, as Larry
French outpitches Cy Blanton to win his 5th of the month. The Cubs, in
winning their 18th straight, maintain their hold on 1st place by 3 games
over the Cardinals. With 40,558 today, Chicago has 202,283 fans who have
watched the final six games. Blanton finishes his year with a 2.58 ERA,
tops in the NL, and his 142 strikeouts sets a Pirates rookie record that
will not be broken this century.

The Cards shave the lead to 3 games by twice beating the Reds, 14-4 and
3-1. Mike Ryba, in relief of Bill Hallahan in the 2nd, wins the opener
pitching 7 innings of two-hit ball in his major league debut. He also knocks
in 3 runs on two hits. Dizzy Dean wins his 28th, allowing just three hits
and striking out ten, to take the nitecap.

The Boston Braves lose their 110th game for a new NL record, dropping a pair
to the Phils, 7-5 and 4-3. Timely homers by Johnny Moore and Watkins win the
games for the Quakers. The Braves will lose 115, which remains the record
until the 1962 expansion New York Mets lose 120 in a 162-game schedule. The
Braves winning percentage of .248 is a 20th Century low in the NL.

Washington beats up on the A's, 10-2 and 11-1. Buck Newsom wins the opener,
scattering 9 hits, and collecting a single, double and triple, and drives
in three runs in game one. Holbrook has a triple and 3 RBIs for the Nats
in game 2.

The Browns' Earl Caldwell, up from San Antonio (Texas) defeats the leading
Tigers, 1-0, on three hits. Schoolboy Rowe is the loser and his error in the
6th allows the only run. Caldwell pitched briefly in the NL seven years ago.

At Fenway, a record crowd of 47,627 - with 10,000 turned away - watch the
Yankees sweep the Red Sox, 6-4 and 9-0. New York stops Wes Ferrell's bid
for his 25th win in game one, and Walter Brown, the hurling mammoth, gives
up just 4 hits in the nitecap. In game 2, the Yanks have 7 ground rule
doubles into the roped-off crowd. The Sunday Law stops the game after 8
innings. Competing for prizes donated by Tom Yawkey, the Yanks also defeat
the Sox in the pre-game Field Day, winning 4 of 5 events. Ben Chapman
wins the 75-yard dash nipping Jesse Hill by a yard. Recently acquired Sox
Skinny Graham is 3rd. The lone Sox triumph comes when catcher Rick Ferrell
throws into a barrel at 2B on the fly; Joe Glenn's is in the barrel but on
the bounce Glenn is tops in fungo hitting with a 350-foot drive, and the
Yankees win the walking relay in, well, a walk. Chief interest is the final
event, the four-man relay around the bases, with each runner completing
a circuit. Clocked in 57.2 seconds, the Yankee squad of Selkirk, Hill,
Rolfe and Chapman pass the baton ahead of the quartet of Almada, Graham,
Johnson and Cooke. The field day will be repeated next Sunday at the Stadium.

1936
Detroit batters tee off against the Browns, as Eldon Auker wins the first
game 12-0, then Tommy Bridges coasts to a 14-0 win in the nitecap, his 23rd
victory of the year. The 26 runs in a doubleheader shutout is a ML mark.

1937
Cliff Melton wins his 18th, blanking the Cubs, 6-0. New York again leads
by 2 1/2 games.

1938
Bill Lee of the Cubs pitches his 4th consecutive shutout, a 4-0 blanking of
the Phils. He matches the feat of Ed Reulbach (1908) and Grover Alexander
(1911). It is Lee's 9th shutout of the season. Clay Bryant wins the nitecap
for Chicago, 2-1, for his 18th victory.

The Pirates take two from the Dodgers, winning 6-0 behind Jim Tobin and 11-6,
and remain in first place by 3 1/2 games.

The visiting Cardinals lose a pair to the Boston Bees, 6-5 and 4-1, then
set a first by flying to New York aboard two TWA planes. In New York,
the team catches an overnight train to Chicago.

1939
The first-place Reds sweep a pair from the Pirates, 6-0 and 10-9. Wally
Berger has a grand slam in the 3rd inning of game 2.

1940
Bob Feller comes through again for Cleveland, whipping the Tigers, 10-5,
before 56,771 fans in Detroit. Detroit gets a homer from Greenberg, his
40th, but Feller matches that with his 2nd of the year, and Hal Trosky, Roy
Weatherly, Ben Chapman and Ken Keltner also go deep for the Tribe. Detroit's
lead is cut to a game.

At Chicago, the Cards sweep two, winning the opener, 8-1, behind Mort
Cooper. Dizzy Dean is the loser. Max Lanier takes the nitecap, 2-1, over
Larry French.

The Reds' Jim Turner 2-hits the Pirates, winning 2-1 in Pittsburgh. The
Reds will set a ML record this year with 41 one-run victories.

At Brooklyn, the 2nd-place Dodgers sweep a pair from the last-place Phillies,
winning 6-3 and 8-6. In between games, there is a 3-inning oldtimers match
between the Robins and Dodger players of the 1930s. Included on the Robins
side are fan favorite Zach Wheat, Tim Jordan, Otto Miller, Rube Marquard,
Sherry Smith and Hy Myers. The Dodgers are represented by Fresco Thompson,
Joe Stripp, Del Bissonette, Rube Bressler, Val Picinich, Waite Hoyt and
Dazzy Vance among others. Also on hand is turn of the century Brooklyn
player Bill Dahlen. The 30's youngsters whip the oldtime Robins, 6-3.

1941
Because of a waiver rule violation, Commissioner Landis cancels the September
10th deal in which the Cardinals sold P Hank Gornicki to the Cubs for
$7500. Gornicki made one appearance for Chicago before going back to the
Birds. Undeterred, the Cards will sell Gornicki to Pittsburgh in December.

The Dodgers' Curt Davis shuts out the Phils, 5-0, to boost Brooklyn's lead
to 1 1/2 games over the idle Cards.

1943
In his second ML start, St. Louis rookie Fred Sanford records his
second shutout, stopping the White Sox, 2-0, in the first half of a
doubleheader. Sanford allowed two runs in 3 relief appearances during
1943. Chicago rebounds for an 8-5 win in the second game.

1945
The Tigers eliminate the Browns, winning 9-0 behind Hal Newhouser. Hal
drives in 3 runs with a double and triple.

Roger Wolff wins his 20th for the Senators, stopping the A's, 2-0, to keep
the Nats' hopes alive.

Red Barrett wins his 23rd, 9-4, over the Reds and the Cards move to 1 1/2
games behind the idle Cubs.

1946
At Municipal Stadium, Detroit tops Cleveland, 3-0, as Newhouser beats
Feller for the first time. The battles between the two will result in Feller
winning 8 of 10 decisions. Feller complains after the game that, except for
Dick Wakefield, all the Tiger hitters were chopping at the ball to avoid
striking out. He K's 7 to Newhouser's 9. The Tigers win the nitecap, 4-3.

In a sweep of the A's, rookies Yogi Berra and Bobby Brown debut for the
Yankees. Shortstop Brown has a single and Yogi belts a two-run homer,
off Jesse Flores. New York wins, 4-3 and 7-4.

1948
For the fourth time this season, Stan Musial has five hits in five
at-bats setting a National League record, and tying Ty Cobb's major league
record. The hits 'Stan the Man' collects come off five different pitchers,
on five consecutive pitches.

In Cleveland, 76,772 fans go wild as Bob Feller tops the Red Sox, 5-2, to
move Cleveland into a tie for 1st place with Boston. Ken Keltner's 3-run
HR is the margin of victory. Bill Veeck, who switched the single game from
an afternoon to night game, announces that the Indians' share of the gate
will go to ailing Don Black. The Indians and Red Sox are now tied for 1st
with the Yankees just a half-game back.

The Cards slow the Braves, winning 8-2, the first loss by Boston in 9
games. Stan Musial is a one-man wrecking crew, going 5 for 5 with a double
and his 38th homer of the year as Warren Spahn takes the loss. Al Brazle
is the winner. Enos Slaughter has his nose broken by a line drive off the
bat of teammate Nippy Jones.

1949
Combining 19 hits and 13 walks off 6 Cardinal pitchers, the Dodgers blast a
19-6 win over the host Birds and climb to a half-game behind them. Furillo
sets the pace with 7 runs batted in on 3 doubles and 2 singles. Joe Hatten
goes all the way for his 10th win and his first in his last 7 decisions
against the Cards. Enos Slaughter, hitless for the night, relinquishes the
batting lead to Jackie Robinson who is 2 for 5. Stan Musial belts his 32nd
homer of the year, and his 21st against lefties. This is a record for a
left-handed batter that will be matched by Ken Griffey Jr in 1996 and 1998.

1950
In the top of the 9th in Cleveland, Detroit's Don Kolloway cracks a 2-run
HR off Bob Feller to tie the game at 3-3. In the bottom of the inning, Joe
Gordon takes Hal Newhouser downtown to hand the Tigers a heartbreaking 4-3
loss. The loss pushes the Bengals back into 2nd place. Feller now stands
8-2 against the Tiger ace stretching back to 1940. The two will face off
once more in a no-decision contest in 1952. In the nitecap, Mike Garcia
drops the Bengals another game back with an 10-2 victory, while New York
is shutting out the Red Sox, 8-0. Cleveland is the only team that holds a
winning edge over Detroit this year (13-9).

1951
Larry Jansen stops the Braves on 4 hits, and wins his 20th game, 4-1. The
Giants score 3 in the 8th off Warren Spahn to win it.

It is "Charlie Dressen Night" in Brooklyn and the manager is given an oil
portrait identifying him as the manager of the "National League Champions
1951." The Phils have other ideas as they pound Don Newcombe for 10 hits
in 6 innings to beat the Dodgers, 7-3, who now lead the Giants by just
3 games. Karl Drews has his only victory of the year and also singles,
breaking a string of 77 hitless at-bats stretching back to May of 1947
(as noted by writer Kerry Keene).

OF Irv Noren of the Senators records 11 putouts in CF in a 9-inning 9-1
win over the A's, tying the AL record.

1953
The Dodgers tie the record for the most wins in a home park, beating
Pittsburgh, 5-4. They go an incredible 60-17 at Ebbets Field, tying the record
of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1942. Only the 61 wins of the San Francisco
Giants in 1962 in an 81-game home season will surpass the mark. The Dodgers
will also lead the majors in scoring for the 3rd straight year ... the Red
Sox of 2003-05 will be the next team to do that.

Satchel Paige celebrates his official 46th birthday by starting against
the Tigers and going 7 innings to win, 7-3, in what will be his final ML
victory. Paige gives up a Hatfield HR in the 1st, then holds the Bengals
hitless until the 8th, when he's kayoed. Don Larsen saves it for Satch. The
loss goes to Tigers bonus baby Bob Miller, making his 1st start. Miller
leaves in the 5th inning after being hit on the head by a Les Moss line
drive. Coach Bob Swift is activated and plays in his 1,000th game. He'll
make an appearance in one more.

1954
Recently called up from Fort Worth, Karl Spooner of the Dodgers pitches a 3-0
shutout, fanning 15 Giants in his first ML start. Six of the strikeouts are
consecutive, in the 6th and 7th innings. The 15 is a new ML rookie record
breaking the mark set by Cliff Melton on April 25, 1937. Roy Campanella
calls Spooner "the greatest young pitcher I've ever seen. His fastball is
the damnest thing. It even amazes the umpire."

In the top of the 9th, the Redlegs have runners on 1B (Wally Post) and 2B
(Gus Bell) when Bob Borkowski strikes out on a WP. Braves C Del Crandall
retrieves the ball and throws to 3B in a futile try to catch Bell. Borkowski
takes off for 1B illegally, since 1B is already occupied and there are less
than 2 outs. He draws a throw from 3B Ed Mathews, which hits him in the
back and rolls into RF, and both Bell and Post score. The umpires decide
that Borkowski and Post are both out, the former for drawing an illegal
throw. Milwaukee wins, 3-1, and the Reds protest. Because the standings of
5 teams are affected by the outcome, Warren Giles will uphold the protest,
even though he believes the umpires made the correct decision. The protested
game, starting from the point where Temple is batting with 2 outs in the 9th,
will be played in 2 days and the Braves will win, 4-3.

The Indians beat the White Sox, 3-1, for their 110th win of the season. Don
Mossi takes the victory with a 5-hitter.

Aided by a triple play in the 6th (Skowron to Coleman), the Yankees' Tommy
Byrne hurls a 3-0 win over the Senators.

1956
At Fenway, the Yankees' Don Larsen experiments for the first time with
a no windup delivery. He allows just 4 hits, including a Lepcio homer,
in beating the Red Sox, 2-1. Byrne gets Williams for the last out.

1957
In the 4th inning, Ted Williams hits his 4th HR in 4 games and four at-bats
to tie the ML record for consecutive homers. He adds a single, going 2 for
2 with two walks, but the Yankees top the Red Sox at the Stadium, 5-1, as
starter Tom Sturdivant (15-6) is the winner over Dave Sisler (7-7). With
the victory, the Yanks clinch a tie for the pennant.

Duke Snider's 39th and 40th HRs are the last that will be hit at Ebbets
Field. The Duke of Flatbush ties Ralph Kiner's NL mark of hitting at least
40 HRs in 5 consecutive seasons and is the first major leaguer to reach the
40-homer mark without driving in 100 runs ... he'll finish with 94. Phillie
Robin Roberts, who has a penchant for throwing HR balls, is the loser, 7-3.

In Chicago, the Braves close in on the pennant by topping the Cubs, 9-7,
in the 10th inning on Bob Hazle's HR. Hazle has 21 RBIs since hitting his
first on July 31st. Turk Lown gives up the homer and takes the loss. Don
McMahon is the winner.

1958
The Pirates set strikeout records in their twinbill loss, 3-2 and 1-0, to
the Phillies. Starting pitcher Ronnie Kline of the Pirates fans 5 times in
game 1 (a 14-inning game), as 3 Phillies pitchers strike out an ML-record 21
Bucs. In the 2nd game of the doubleheader, the Phillies' Jack Sanford fans
6 Bucs in a row to help his team fan 10 for the game, and a ML-record 31
for the day. Ashburn regains the batting lead going 6 for 10 to move to .343.

1959
After the White Sox clinch the pennant by beating the second-place Indians at
Cleveland Stadium, 4-2, Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley orders city air raid
sirens to blast. It is the South-siders first American League championship
in 40 years. Early Wynn gets the win, with Gerry Staley saving the game in
the 9th. Al Smith homers for the Sox.

The Dodgers, desperate to break a first-place tie with the Cardinals,
send a ML-record 9 pinch hitters to the plate. The last one, Frank Howard,
hits a 2-out three-run HR, but St. Louis hangs on to win 11-10.

1961
Jim Gentile's 5th grand slam of 1961 ties the ML single-season record
(Ernie Banks, 1955) in Baltimore's 8-6 win over Chicago. Each of his slams
come with Chuck Estrada pitching for the Orioles. Gentile will hit 46 homers
this season with a total of 46 runners on base, the most in a season since
Ruth hit homers with 48 runners on bases in 1921. Chicago's Floyd Robinson
makes the game close with a 9th-inning grand slam of his own, the 7th Sox
slam of the year.

and Joe Bowman of the 1936 Phillies to become 20-game losers on the same
National League team.

1963
For the first time, all three Alou brothers share the outfield. In the seventh
inning, Matty is in LF, Felipe replaces Willie Mays in CF, and Jesus is in

Willie McCovey who hits three homers as the Giants whip the Mets, 13-4.

1964
Larry Dierker, who will have a long relationship with the franchise including
stints as a broadcaster and manager, becomes the last rookie to make his major
league debut as a Colt .45. On his 18th birthday, the right-hander is the
starting pitcher and takes the loss when San Francisco defeats Houston, 7-3.

7-6 in 11 innings.

1966
With only 413 patrons in attendance to see New York's 4-1 loss to the White
Sox, Red Barber's request for a camera to scan the empty stands is denied by
the team's head of media relations. The veteran broadcaster will reportedly
lose his job when he continues to tell his audience, "I don't know what the
paid attendance is today, but whatever it is, it is the smallest crowd in
the history of Yankee Stadium, and this crowd is the story, not the game."

The Orioles beat the host Kansas City A's, 6-1, to clinch their first AL
pennant. Both Brooks Robinson and Frank Robinson have 2 RBIs. Frank Robinson
will end the year as the Triple Crown winner, the first to achieve the feat
since Mickey Mantle in 1956. He clinches with a batting average of .316,
49 HRs and 122 RBIs. Jim Palmer goes the distance today. The franchise's
last flag was raised as the St. Louis Browns in 1944.

stunt in 1965. Tovar starts the game on the mound and the first batter he
faces is Campaneris. Tovar strikes out Reggie Jackson in his one inning.

Behind the potching of Don Sutton (10-15) the Dodgers score 2 earned runs
in beating Bob Gibson (21-9) and the Cardinals, 3-2. Their last run, in the

despite compiling a 2.14 ERA in the nine losses. He has not been knocked
out of the box all year.

1969
Joining Yankee legend Babe Ruth, Willie Mays becomes the second major leaguer
to hit 600 career homeruns. The historic two-run homer is delivered as a
pinch hitter (hitting for rookie George Foster) in the top of the seventh
inning off Padres hurler Mike Corkins, and proves to be the difference in
the Giants' 4-2 victory at Qualcomm Stadium. Giant outfielder Bobby Bonds
establishes a big league record as he strikes out for the 176th time this
season. The Californian native will finish the year with a total of 187
and will extend the record next season with 189 strikeouts.

Angels. Harper has 33 stolen bases and becomes the 5th major leaguer to go
30-30 in the same season. It is Milwaukee's 60th win of the year.

The Twins clinch their 2nd straight AL West title, beating the A's,
5-3. Oliva starts the scoring with a 2-run HR in the 1st.

Rochester (International League) beats Denver (American Association), 9-6,
to win the Junior WS, 4 games to 3.

1972
The Reds clinch the NL West crown with a 4-3 win over the Astros in

1973
John Hiller goes 3 1/3 innings in the Tigers' 5-1 victory over the Red

Kirkwood is the victor.

The Red Sox pick up vet Deron Johnson from the Chicago Whit Sox for minor
leaguer Chuck Erickson and cash. A year ago on September 7, the Sox purchased
Johnson from the Brewers and then released him at the end of the year. This
time, Deron will play 15 games in 1976 before being released.

1976
Right-hander Don Sutton goes the distance to become a twenty game winner
for the first and last time when the Dodgers beat the Giants at Candlestick
Park, 3-1. The future Hall of Famer will compile a 324-256 (.559) record
during his 23-year career in the bigs.

1977
Bert Blyleven pitches a no-hitter as the Rangers beat the Angels,
6-0. Blyleven (14-12), who grew up two miles from the Angels' Anaheim Stadium
and owns a restaurant nearby, fans seven including the side in the 7th
inning. A third-inning error, in which the runner is erased on a double play,
and a walk, issued with two outs in the ninth, account for the only two base
runners in the game for Anaheim. Paul Hartzell gives up 12 hits in losing.

1980
The Phillies move back into first place in the NL East with a 3-2 10-inning
win over the Cardinals. Montreal drops to 2nd place by a half-game by losing
to Pittsburgh. The Phils' Steve Carlton and the Birds' Pete Vuckovich each
pitch 9 innings of 2-run ball, but Lefty gets the win when Keith Moreland

games in a season.

1987
Wade Boggs goes 2 for 4 in Boston's 8-5 loss to Detroit, reaching the 200-hit
plateau for an AL-record tying 5th consecutive year. Al Simmons and Charlie
Gehringer are the only other AL players to do so. The Red Sox third baseman
will reached the 200-hit mark for two more consecutive seasons before the
streak ends in 1990.

Teddy Higuera wins his 7th straight as the Brewers down the Yankees, 7-2,
in the first of 2 games. Robin Yount drives in 4 runs with a homer and a
double. Yount drives home another 5 in game 2, including his 20th homer of
the season, but it is not enough as New York wins, 10-8.

final big league appearance, a 1st inning grand slam to Dann Howitt. Ryan
leaves the game, after throwing only 28 pitches, with a torn ligament in
his right elbow as the Mariners top the Rangers, 7-4. The grand slam is the
10th that Ryan has served up, a ML record, and Nolan is the only pitcher to
serve up a grand slam on the last pitch in his career. Bob Gibson is close,
but retired a batter after serving up a slam.

1996
Oakland 1B Mark McGwire becomes the 30th player to homer twice in the same

come back with 7 of their own in their half.

Cincinnati SS Barry Larkin hits his 30th HR of the year in the Reds' 6-3
win over the Cardinals in the opening game of a twin bill. He thus becomes
the 1st SS to join the exclusive 30-30 club. Mets 3B Howard Johnson is the
only other IF to perform the feat. In the nightcap of the twin bill, Reds P
John Smiley holds the Cardinals to a single hit - a Royce Clayton single -
in shutting St. Louis out by a count of 6-0.

The Pirates win their 11th in a row, defeating the Cubs, 11-3. Jay Bell

(59 in 1921), Foxx (58 in 1932), Greenberg (58 in 1938) and Wilson (56 in
1930). Griffey's 55 homers are the most in the majors since Maris set the
record in 1961. He has 5 games left, all at the Kingdome, to match Maris'
mark. With 3 HRs, Seattle has 257 this season, tying the major league mark
set by Baltimore last year.

set by Ted Williams.

Tony Clark becomes the first Detroit player since Rudy York (1937-38)
to drive in 100 runs in each of his first two full seasons in the Motor City.

single-season homerun mark hitting their 240th in a 12-5 loss to the Reds at
Cinergy Field. The slugfest features nine homeruns with Cincinnati hitting
six and Houston going deep three times. Astro Jose Lima sets an National
League record by giving up his 47th homerun of the season passing the 1956
mark of Robin Roberts. Bert Blyleven holds the major league mark serving
up 50 gopher balls as a Twin in 1986.

2001
The Dodgers score 3 times in the bottom half of the 11th inning to eke out
a 6-5 victory over the Diamondbacks. Damian Miller gets 2 hits for Arizona,
giving him 100 for the season. By doing so, he helps the Diamondbacks tie a
NL record for most players (9) with at least 100 hits in the same season. The
NL teams include the 1923 Phils, the 1928 Giants and the Pirates in 1972
and 1976.

The Mariners lose their 3rd straight game for the 1st time all season,
falling to the A's, 11-2. It also marks the first series the Mariners have

road series without a loss. Eric Hiljus (4-0) is the winner. Tejada and
Chavez hits solo HRs in the 7th as both reach the 100-RBI mark.

2002
Chicago first baseman Fred McGriff becomes the first player to hit 30
homeruns in a season for five different teams (Blue Jays, Braves, Cubs,

one more than Ellis Burks of the Indians. The Pirates beat the Cubs, 5-4,
as Kris Benson wins his 5th straight.

In last game ever played at Cinergy Field, the Phillies complete a three-game
sweep defeating the Reds, 4-3, in front of many of the team's former
superstars except for the banished Pete Rose. The all-time hit leader,
however, is not forgotten as Tom Browning paints Rose's uniform number 14
on the pitcher's mound after the game with red spray paint and, as home
plate is dug up to be delivered next door to the Great American Ball Park,
the crowd begins to chant, "Pete, Pete".

Greg Maddux pitches seven innings of four-hit ball as the Braves beat
the Marlins, 4-1. 'Mad Dog' joins Cy Young as one of only two pitchers in

20th win of the season as the Red Sox beat the hapless Orioles, 13-2. Trot

playoff hopes alive. Martinez joins Derek Lowe in giving the Sox the first
pair of 20-game winners since 1949.

Mike Sweeney of the Kansas City Royals and Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red
Sox are locked in a tight race for the American League batting title. After
play today, Sweeney has a lead of less than .001 over Ramirez, .346578 to
.346062. But, by Thursday, Ramirez will move ahead by .003099 after going
4 for 11 to raise his average to .3465116 while Sweeney will go 2 for 10
to put his mark at .343413.

2003
Hitting his 13th leadoff homerun of the season, Alfonso Soriano establishes
a new major league record. The Yankees second baseman has been tied with

Yankees, 6-3 in 10 innings.

For only the third time in major league history, a Korean pitcher and a
Japanese pitcher oppose one another as Expos hurler Tomo Ohka faces Jae
Weong Seo as starters at Shea Stadium. Both Pacific Rim right handers throw
well but neither gets the decision as Montreal beats the Mets on misplayed
fly balls in the ninth, 4-2.

The Tigers establish a new mark for futility in the American League recording
their 118th loss of the season. The 1916 A's (36-117) had held the record
prior to Detroit's 12-6 defeat to the Royals.

In a 7-5 win over the Orioles, the Boston Red Sox break a major-league record
when Kevin Millar lines a double to left field in the eighth inning becoming
the 8th Bosox player this season to hit 30 doubles. The previous record was
7 players with 30 two-baggers shared by four teams, the last being the 2001
Florida Marlins. Millar joins Bill Mueller, David Ortiz, Todd Walker, Nomar
Garciaparra, Manny Ramirez, Johnny Damon and Jason Varitek to set the record.

2004
By whiffing Albert Pujols in the 3-2 loss to the Cardinals, Ben Sheets breaks
the Brewers single-season strikeout record. The 26-year-old Louisiana native
surpasses Teddy Higuera's mark of 240 established in 1987.

The Mariners pound out 24 hits in a 16-6 rout of the Angels. Raul Ibanez
ties an AL record with 6 hits for Seattle. Ichiro Suzuki gets 4 more hits
to give him 247 on the season.

2005
On the day he is scheduled to return to the team after rehabilitating
his right knee and left ankle at home, the Orioles inform Rafael Palmeiro
not to report to the team. The first baseman/DH, who tested positive for
steroids earlier in the season, continues to stir up more controversy as
the 40-year-old veteran states the reason for failing the drug test was
due to vitamin B-12 shot given by his teammate, Miguel Tejada.

An American Society of Microbiology's study of the number people of who
wash their hands after using a public restroom reports 83 percent of patrons
take advantage of the available soap and water. Of the 6,300 bathroom users
monitored, the worst hygiene was found at Turner Field during a Braves
game where approximately a quarter of the patrons (37% male and 16% female)
did not wash their hands after using the facilities.

2006
The Padres down the Pirates, 6-2 on a 1-hitter. Chris Young takes a no-hitter
into the 9th inning, but loses his bid to become the 1st SD pitcher to
notch one when Joe Randa hits a 2-run HR.

The Brewers overcome 6 RBIs by Barry Bonds and edge the Giants,
13-12. Bonds has two doubles and a homer, while Ray Durham has a double
and a homer. Milwaukee has no homers. Prince Fielder steals his 7th base
of the year; his dad, Cecil, stole only two in his 1,470-game career.

The Nationals squeak by the Mets, 3-2. Alfonso Soriano doubles for Washington
to become baseball's first 40-40-40 player, with 45 homers, 41 stolen bases
and 40 doubles.

2009
Diamondback slugger Mark Reynolds establishes a new single-season strikeout
mark for the second year in a row when he misses a 1-2 breaking ball from
Madison Bumgarner, his 205th K of the campaign. Prior to breaking his own
dubious mark and extending it with another whiff in the sixth inning,
the 26-year-old third baseman collected his 100th RBI of the season in
Arizona's 10-8 Chase Field victory over San Francisco.

2010
The Diamondbacks hire Kevin Towers as the team's general manager, bypassing
the interim GM Jerry Dipoto, who is highly regarded within the organization
and throughout baseball for the job he did replacing Josh Byrnes. During
Towers' 14-year tenure in the same position with the Padres, San Diego won
four division titles and played in the 1998 World Series against New York.

2011
Leo Nunez is placed on the restricted list by the Marlins without the
club listing a reason, but the Associated Press has reported that the
Florida closer, whose real name is Juan Oviedo, needs to return to the
Dominican Republic to deal with legal issues pertaining to the use of fake
identification documents. The 29-year-old right-handed reliever used his
childhood friend's identity in order to receive a more lucrative deal due
to being believed to be only 16 years of age instead of 17 when signing
his first major league contract.

2012
Gio Gonzalez becomes the second pitcher in franchise history to win 20 games
in a season when Washington beats Milwaukee at Nationals Park, 10-4. The
27-year-old southpaw joins Ross Grimsley, who accomplished the feat in 1978
when the club played in Montreal as the Expos.

2013
Felix Hernandez, making his first appearance since suffering a strained
oblique, sets a record for strikeouts in a start lasting four or fewer
innings when he whiffs 10 batters before the fifth frame in the Mariners'
3-2 victory at Angel Stadium. The fans aren't the only ones buzzing during
King Felix's performance as a swarm of bees in the outfield delays the
contest for 23 minutes during the third inning.

2019
Nelson Cruz recorded his 400th career homerun in the fourth inning against
the Kansas City Royals. He became the 57th player, and tenth Dominican-born
player, to reach this mark.
