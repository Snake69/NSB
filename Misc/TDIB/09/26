1901
The Reds are glad to not to be playing Brooklyn, and whip Boston, 7-2,
behind Noodles Hahn. Bill Dinneen takes the loss, though he hits his lone
ML career homer today.

1904
In Philadelphia, Connie Mack correctly predicts the AL finish saying, "It
certainly looks like the Plymouth Rocks will take the bunting," because of all
the postponed games the crippled Highlanders have to make up. The New York
Highlanders then lose a pair to Cleveland, 4-3 and 6-2. Jack Chesbro loses
the opener, his first defeat in 10 games, when Stovall hits a bases-loaded
triple in the 8th. Powell struggles in the loss in game 2 after Turner
hits a double off his knee. Meanwhile, Boston sweeps Detroit, 2-0 and 5-3,
and now leads the AL race by 2 games. Bill Dinneen applies the calcimine
in the opener and Cy Young in relief of Winter (one inning) takes game 2.

1905
Chicago White Sox P Ed Walsh hurls two complete-game victories over Boston,
winning by scores of 10-5 and 3-1. When Doc White leaves the first game
after giving up a single to Freddie Parent in the first inning (Doc says
the wind was blowing and his curve ball would not break), Walsh comes in
without warming up. He gives up 5 runs in the first, then blanks Boston
the rest of the way to win. The second match goes 8 innings before darkness
falls. The Sox score a pair in the 8th.

At Philadelphia, A's starter Andy Coakley pitches 7 innings and is behind,
4-2, against the Tigers when he departs. The A's knot the score with
runs in the 7th and 8th, and reliever Jimmy Dygert tosses the last three
innings. When the Tigers score 2 in the 10th to win, the scorer pins the loss
on Coakley for pitching badly (later revisions will give the loss to Dygert,
and Coakley's record of 20-7 will be the AL's best winning percentage).

The Giants top the Pirates, 9-5, with the help of 8 walks and a hit-by-pitch
in six innings by usually steady Mike Lynch. Red Ames goes six innings to
pick up the win, and Mathewson tosses the last 3 innings of shutout ball.

In a twinbill split with Cleveland, Washington's Joe Stanley hits his second
and last career homer and like his first, it's a grand slam. He did it with
the Boston Nationals in 1903 making him the first player to slam in both
the NL and AL. Washington loses game 1, 2-0, then wins, 13-6.

1906
Rookie OF John Cameron of Boston, after one relief appearance, gets a starting
assignment against the Cardinals. Leadoff batter Tom O'Hara beats out an
infield single. Al Burch's line drive hits Cameron in the head, and caroms
back on a fly to C Jack O'Neill, who throws to Fred Tenney at 1B, doubling
off O'Hara. Cameron retires with one assist and a headache as Boston loses,
6-3. Cameron will play in one more ML game, the finale on October 5.

In the 2nd shortened no-hitter in 3 days, Lefty Leifield of Pittsburgh
hurls a 6-inning no-hitter against Philadelphia, winning 8-0. Pittsburgh
wins by a shutout, 5-0, in the first game as well.

The Athletics finally score after being shut out for a ML record 48
consecutive innings, dating back to September 22nd. Harry Davis breaks the
long drought with a 2-run double against Cleveland in the 6th, but the A's
still lose 5-3. The 1968 Cubs will tie this record.

The White Sox beat visiting Boston, 2-0, and sweep the 3-game series. The
Highlanders lose by the same score to Detroit, which sweeps its 3-game
series, effectively dampening the Highlanders' pennant hopes. They now
trail by 2 games.

1908
With the Cubs just a half game in back of New York, Chicago's Ed Reulbach
shoulders a ML record by becoming the only pitcher to throw two shutouts
in one day, blanking host Brooklyn, 5-0 and 3-0. Big Ed allows 5 hits in
the A.M. game, and is even stingier in the afternoon, yielding 3 hits and
a walk. He finishes the afternoon contest in 1 hour 12 minutes. The entire
doubleheader is played in less than three hours. Kaiser Wilhelm and Jim
Pastorius are the losing pitchers.

Vic Willis tosses a 6-hit shutout over Boston for a 5-0 Pittsburgh win.

The Giants sweep the Reds, 6-2 and 3-1, behind victories by Mathewson and
Red Ames. For Matty, it is his 35th win.

Detroit's Wild Bill Donovan stops the A's, 3-2, while the White Sox are
trouncing the Highlanders, 12-0. The A's scores end their ML-record streak
of 48 innings without a run ... the Cubs will match this in 1968.

Washington's Walter Johnson loses, 5-4, to Cleveland when he makes a
throwing error.

1911
At Shibe Park, the A's clinch their 2nd straight AL pennant, defeating
the Tigers, 11-5. Frank Baker leads the offense with a homer and 2
doubles. Detroit, which led the A's by 12 games in May, will finish 2nd,
13 1/2 games back.

1912
The Giants clinch the NL flag with a sweep of the Braves, winning 8-3
and 4-0. Mathewson coasts to his 23rd win in the opener and Al Demaree,
recently called up from Mobile where he was 25-10, shuts out the Braves on
7 hits in the nitecap. Demaree strikes out 9 in his first major-league start.

Trailing 9-0 going into the 9th inning at Chicago, the Reds stage a terrific
comeback against Jimmy Lavender. Lavender gives up 5 runs and is lifted with
the bases loaded. Reliever Fred Toney then walks three straight before Larry
Chaney is brought in. The Reds then take an unlikely 10-9 lead as Chaney
walks 2 straight. Reds pitcher Ralph Works catches the fever walking one
Cub and hitting another. Reliever Rube Benton quickly relieves and follows
suit, walking 3 batters in a row to give the Cubs the 11-10 decision. The
10 runs in the 9th when trailing won't be matched until the 1962 White Sox
do it against Cleveland on August 11.

1914
Pete Alexander wins his 9th in a row for the Phils, beating the Reds,
7-4. Gavvy Cravath hits his 18th homer, off King Lear, and Sherry Magee
clouts his 15th.

At Fenway Park, the Braves roll over the Cubs, 6-2 and 12-2. Lefty Tyler
tops Hippo Vaughn in the opener, and Otto Hess beats Larry Chaney in the
2nd game. The red hot Braves will sweep the four-game series with the Cubs.

Meanwhile, the Giants split with the Pirates, winning and losing by 4-2
scores. Babe Adams wins the nitecap for the Bucs, shutting out the Giants
in the last 8 innings.

Manager Joe Tinker of the ChiFeds will appeal to FL prexy Gilmore to
outlaw the emery ball after he plays today's game with the BrookFeds under
protest. In the 2nd inning, with Tinker on 3B, Tom Seaton of the BrookFeds
strikes out 2 Whales and Tinker protests to ump Barry McCormick, who examines
the ball and finds it filed on one side. Tinker accuses Seaton of using
emery paper, which the pitcher denies. Tinker then discovers the emery in
the pitcher's glove. Seaton refuses to hand it over to the ump but instead
gives it to Brooklyn manager Bradley, who hands it back to Seaton on the
bench. When Tinker says he won't play anymore if Seaton continues to doctor
the ball, the pitcher laughs. He doesn't laugh in the 8th when he walks 4
men and refuses to be lifted, saying he wants to finish the game. But the
Tinx win, 7-6, and take the 2nd game, 5-3, to remain temporarily in first
place ahead of Indianapolis.

1916
Washington manager Griffith excuses several regulars for the remaining games
of the season so he can use some new players. Included in the excused is
25-game winner Walter Johnson. In a league-leading 371 IPs, he did not give
up a HR, an all-time record.

The Braves' Lefty Tyler beats the Pirates, 1-0, for his 3rd 1-0 game in
two months.

1917
The Braves' Jesse Barnes tops the Reds, 1-0, in the first of two games. Art
Nehf follows with a 3-0 win to sweep Cincinnati.

1919
Carl Mays gives up 2 unearned runs in the Yankees' 8-2 victory over the
Athletics. He strikes out 7.

In Chicago, Detroit makes 8 errors but the Tigers still beat the White Sox,
10-7. Resting most of their regulars, the Sox make 4 errors.

The Braves tie the Giants, 4-4, in the 7th and acting manager Mathewson brings
in the veteran Jean Dubuc to shut out Boston the rest of the way. The Giants
win, 5-3, giving Dubuc (6-4) his 22nd game-finish, the NL high. Despite his
2.66 ERA, this is his last game. He will be banned for life for failing to
report that he had prior knowledge to the WS fix.

The NL champion Reds win a pair from the Cubs, 6-5 and 3-0. Slim Sallee
wins his 21st game in the opener and in the 9th inning helps with a single
as the Reds score the winning run. He walks none, ending the year with 21
wins and just 20 walks. Not till Saberhagen in 1994 who will win 14 and walk
13 will anyone match him. The Reds rip Hippo Vaughn in the nitecap and win,
8-0, behind Fisher's 3-hitter.

1920
In his last game of the season, Pittsburgh's Babe Adams (17-13) walks one
in an 8-0 loss to the Reds. He has walked 18 in 263 IPs, making him the
stingiest pitcher ever for one season.

Rube Marquard pitches his final victory as a Dodger, a 4-2 win over his
former team, the Giants, and allows just 5 hits. The Giants will lose
tomorrow to Boston and the Dodgers will clinch the pennant.

In St. Louis, an overflow Sunday crowd of 30,000 watch the Indians top
the Browns, 7-5, behind 7 innings of strong relief by George Uhle. Joe
Sewell knocks home 4 runs and Steve O'Neill contributes a drive that hits
a mounted policeman's horse for a ground rule double. Marty McManus debuts
with St. Louis and is 1 for 3 with a triple.

Chicago's Eddie Cicotte tosses a 7 hitter in beating the Tigers, 8-1. The
Sox stay a half-game in back of the Tribe.

1921
Ruth hits Nos. 57 and 58 plus a double and a walk to beat the Indians, 8-7,
and the Yankees take a 2 game lead. George Burns adds a triple and 3 singles
for New York in the come-from-behind win. The Indians load the bases in the
9th inning but Steve Neill strikes out on a Carl Mays fastball in the dirt
to end it.

1924
With the Yankees beating the A's, Boston tightens the race by edging the
Senators, 2-1. September call-up Wade Lefler drives in Nemo Leibold in the
8th with a pinch double for the Nats' only run. Washington now leads by a
game. For the Senators, the loss stops Walter Johnson's 13-game win streak
and Sam Rice's 31-game hit streak.

1925
With the pennant clinched, the Pirates get shut out for the 2nd time in
3 days, losing twice to the visiting Giants. Fred Fitzsimmons stops the
Bucs, 3-0, in the nitecap beating Johnny Morrison. Zeke Barnes outpitches
Vic Aldridge, 4-3, in the opener. To the dismay of the 25,000 on hand,
the Bucs' leading batter Kiki Cuyler is hitless.

Cleveland sends rookie Ray Benge against Philadelphia and, in his first ML
start, he stops the A's, 6-0.

Babe Ruth gives New York a 6-5 win over the White Sox when he hits an
ultimate grand slam, off Sarg Connally, in the 10th inning. It is a first
in the AL and the first this century.

Philadelphia fans chip in to buy a new automobile for the A's player chosen
by the press as MVP. The winner:  Al Simmons with 30 points. Mickey Cochrane,
a .331 hitter in his first year, is 2nd.

1926
In his final day in a Tiger uniform, Ty Cobb watches his replacement in
centerfield get six hits in a twin bill with the Red Sox to become the new
batting champ as Heinie Manush edges Babe Ruth .378 to .372 for the title.

The Browns beat the Yankees twice, 6-1 and 6-2, in a total time of 2 hours
7 minutes, a ML record for a twinbill. The 2nd game is the fastest in AL
history:  55 minutes. The Yanks total 19 hits while the Browns collect 26 in
the two games. Ruth has one at-bat, then sits, and misses reliever George
Sisler, who tosses 2 scoreless innings to finish for the Browns in game
2 and, when the Browns score 4 in the 8th, picks up the victory. Ruth has
47 homers - twice the runner-up - and also leads the AL with 139 runs, 155
RBIs and 144 bases on balls. Ruth is batting .372, 2nd to Detroit's Heinie
Manush, who will go 6 for 9 on the last day to end at .378. Browns coach
Jimmie Austin, 46 years old, participates in the nitecap and contributes to
the win by knocking in a run with a double and then stealing home. He is
not the oldest to steal a base (Arlie Latham, 50, in 1909), but he is the
oldest to steal home. The Yankees use Fred Merkle in his final game. Merkle
replaces Gehrig at 1B in the 6th.

The Series-bound Cardinals lose to the Reds, 2-1, when Cincinnati scores
2 runs in the 9th. Pete Donohue wins his 20th for the Reds.

At Brooklyn, the Robins take a pair from the Cubs, winning 3-1 and 6-2. Dazzy
Vance strikes out 15 batters for the 3rd and last time in his career in the
opener. Only three NL pitchers (Hahn, Mathewson, Rucker) this century have
struck out 15 in a 9-inning game, and no one has topped it.

Detroit takes a pair from the Red Sox, winning 11-2 and 5-4. Bob Fothergill
hits for the cycle for the host Tigers.

1927
In a game that ends after 6 innings, the Cubs play their last home date and
report a season's attendance of 1,190,000, the first time the Cubs go over
a million. The Pirates' Johnny Miljus picks up a 1-0 win over veteran Art
Nehf, recently acquired by the Cubs.

After 13 straight wins, Giants spitballer Burleigh Grimes takes a loss as
the Phils win, 9-2, for just their 50th win of the year. The Giants are
now in 3rd place, 3 1/2 games back with just 5 to play.

At Boston, the Red Sox lose twice to the Senators, 4-3 and 11-1. The
Sox pull off a triple play in the lid lifter, but then make 10 errors -
5 in the 1st inning - in the nitecap. Catcher Bill Moore chips in with a
record-tying 4 errors.

1928
The Cardinals lose to Brooklyn, 6-1, but still hold a half-game lead over
New York. Dazzy Vance sets down the Mound Citymen on 5 hits and strikes
out 7 to beat Mitchell.

1929
In Washington, the Yankees blast 3 Senator pitchers for a 10-3 win. Gehrig,
Ruth and Dickey each triple for the victors.

1930
St. Louis tops the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 2nd day in a row, as 37-year-old
Jesse Haines pitches the Cards to a 10-5 pennant-clinching win. Rookie
George Watkins has 3 hits, including a HR, and will finish the year with
a .373 average, the highest ever for a rookie.

1932
In a doubleheader split with the Giants, Chuck Klein of the Phillies is
0 for 8 but closes the season with 38 HRs and 20 SBs to become the only
player of the lively-ball era (1920 and after) to lead his league in these
2 departments. Klein also finishes 2nd in RBIs (137), while teammates Don
Hurst (143) and Pinky Whitney (124) finish 1st and 3rd. In this century, only
the 1915 Tigers and 1928 Yankees have the top three RBI producers in a season.

1934
Although beaten by the Phils, 5-4, the Giants hold onto first place by a
game as the Cards lose to Pittsburgh. Waite Hoyt stops St. Louis on 2 hits
to win, 3-0, over Paul Dean. The Giants lose, 5-4, as Gus Mancuso's passed
ball in the 9th allows the winning run to score. Gus has 2 homers in the
game to drive in all the runs.

Hank Greenberg hits a grand slam in Detroit's 10-3 win over the White
Sox. Greenberg has just 26 homers this year, but his 63 doubles will lead
the AL.

1935
Rain washes out the Cubs-Cards game.

1937
The Pirates sweep a twinbill from the Reds, winning 5-4 and 2-1. Pittsburgh's
record against the Reds this year is 17 wins and one defeat.

1938
With several players from the Pirates in the stands at Wrigley, Bill Lee
wins his 21st game, stopping the Reds, 6-3. However, the Reds stop Lee's
streak of scoreless innings at 37 1/3.

1940
The Yankees stay in contention by sweeping a pair from the A's, 5-4 and
2-0. New York, winners of 8 straight, are now 2 1/2 games behind Detroit
and a half-game behind Cleveland. Red Ruffing wins the opener with homerun
support from Joe Gordon and Bill Dickey. For Gordon, it is his 30th homer
of the year. Ernie Bonham allows 4 hits in the nitecap.

The fading Red Sox lose to the Senators, 6-5, as the Nats have 3 straight
hits in the 9th, including Cecil Travis' game-winning hit, to emerge
victorious. Losing hurler Jim Bagby Jr sets a ML record for pitchers when
he makes all 3 putouts in the 4th inning. It won't be matched until 1963.

Behind Harry Gumbert and Bob Carpenter, the Giants beat the Phils, 3-1
and 2-1. Both Phillie tallies come in the 9th. Giants CF John Rucker, the
Crabapple Comet, records his first homer in game one, an inside-the-park
homer.

1941
Rick Ferrell's bunt single - intended as a sac bunt - in the 5th inning is the
only hit against Bob Feller as Cleveland edges St. Louis, 3-2. It is Feller's
25th win and his 5th one-hitter. The Browns win the opener, 6-5 in 11 innings.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1942
Youngsters, admitted free for bringing scrap metal to aid the war effort,
get restless and invade the field at the Polo Grounds in the 8th inning
of the 2nd game with the Giants leading, 5-2. Umpire Ziggy Sears forfeits
the game, 9-0, to the Braves. Boston P Warren Spahn is not charged with
a decision, although he was losing at the time of the forfeit. But he is
given credit for a complete game, his only one in 4 appearances for the
year. Carl Hubbell wins the opener, 6-4.

The Dodgers win their 7th straight, 8-3, over the Phils and gain a half-game
on the idle Cards. Dolf Camilli drives in 4 runs and is the front man in
a triple steal. Larry French (15-4) wins in relief.

1943
The White Sox make it an easy 15-3 win over the Senators by scoring 13 runs
in the 4th, an AL record (also for 2 clubs) for the inning. The Nats shrug
off the loss to win game 2, 5-2.

The Reds whitewash the Braves twice as Elmer Riddle, with his 21st win,
stops them, 2-0 in the opener, and Johnny Vander Meer wins the nitecap, 1-0,
when Gee Walker homers with 2 outs in the 9th. It is the first game-ending
homer in 29 years. It is the 4th doubleheader shutout in the NL this season
and the second time in 4 years that these two pitchers have combined for
shutouts in a DH.

The Giants beat the Pirates, 5-0, and then lose game 2 in the 10th, 4-3. It
is their 91st loss, a 20th Century record for New York. Frankie Gustine
has a steal in each including a swipe of home in game 2.

1944
Sig Jakucki pitches the Browns to a 1-0 win over the Red Sox to keep
St. Louis in 1st place.

In the first of two games at Shibe Park, the 4th-place Cubs maul the Phils,
15-0, behind Hank Wyse's 4-hitter. Dewey Williams and Phil Cavarretta each
drive in 4 runs. Lou Novikoff hits his final homer as a Cub. The Phils
rebound in the nitecap to win, 10-1.

1945
The first-place Tigers gain a doubleheader split with the Indians when Hal
Newhouser shuts out the Tribe, 11-0. The Bengals fail to clinch as they
lose the nitecap, 3-2, to Steve Gromek. The split leaves Detroit a game
ahead of the idle Senators with 2 games left in St. Louis.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants pass the million mark in attendance for the
first time ever. The draw today is a hook up between the Giants and Dodgers,
but Brooklyn's Ralph Branca beats New York righty Jack Brewer, 8-1.

The Cards whip the Cubs, 11-6, to move back to 1 1/2 games behind Chicago. The
Cardinals finish the season with Chicago winning 16 of their 22 meetings,
a ML-record number of wins against a pennant winner. The Cubs will sweep
two from the Reds tomorrow to clinch a tie for the pennant, and sweep two
from Pittsburgh on the 29th to win it.

1946
The Dodgers beat the Phils, 8-2, to move within a half-game of the idle
Cardinals. Dodger RF Pete Reiser fractures his leg sliding back into 1B
and is out for the year. Reiser was hitting .277 with 73 RBIs.

1948
The Braves (87-60) clinch the NL flag by defeating the Giants, 3-2, behind
Bob Elliott's three-run homer. They have six games to play, with an unplayed
game against the Reds. Brooklyn (82-67) is six games back and the Cards
(81-67) trail by 6 1/2, each with six to play. The Braves will finish 6
1/2 games ahead of the Dodgers, but two days before the season is over
the Braves will lose their best hitter, OF Jeff Heath, who breaks an ankle
sliding home against Brooklyn. The broken ankle effectively ends his career,
though he plays briefly next year for Boston and in 1950 for Seattle (PCL).

Bob Feller allows five hits and outduels Newhouser to give the Indians a
4-1 win over Detroit before 57,888 Tiger fans. Feller wins his 6th straight
with the help of a two-run homer by Joe Gordon. Cleveland moves into first
place this Sunday night after the Yankees top the Red Sox.

The Yankees' Tommy Henrich reaches Mel Parnell for a two-run homer in
the 1st inning and Joe DiMaggio adds another pair in the 4th inning on a
single. Tommy Byrne stops the Red Sox to give New York a 6-2 win. But Gus
Niarhos, NY's starting catcher since early August, breaks his finger and
is out for the year.

1949
Before 67,434 at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox survive a rhubarb-filled 7-6
win when Johnny Pesky scores on a disputed squeeze play. The Sox, down, 6-3,
in the 5th when Joe Page comes in, score 4 in the 8th to win. The winning
score comes in when Bobby Doerr drops a surprise squeeze bunt in front of
Tommy Henrich, playing 3B, and Pesky slides under Houk's tag at home. Ump
Bill Grieve disagrees with every fan in the park by calling Pesky safe,
and three Yanks - Cliff Mapes, Stengel and Houk - are fined for a post-game
confrontation with the ump. Leading by one game, the Sox move on to Washington
for a 3-game series before the last 2 games of the year with the Yankees.

1950
Phils relief ace Jim Konstanty makes his 71st appearance, a ML record,
in the Phils' 8-7 win over the Braves in front of 1,987 Boston fans.

1951
The Giants stay one game behind the Dodgers as Jim Hearn tops the Phillies,
10-1, and the Dodgers crush the Braves, 15-5. Campanella drives home 3
runs in the first inning and Newcombe coasts to his 19th win. With a 13-3
lead in the 8th inning, Robinson steals home against rookie P Lew Burdette,
infuriating the Braves.

1952
The Yanks clinch their 4th straight pennant with an 11-inning 5-2 win
at Philadelphia behind Ed Lopat and Johnny Sain. Billy Martin's two-out
two-run single in the 11th clinches it. The loser is starter Harry Byrd,
who gives up early solo homers to Mantle and Irv Noren. Gus Zernial's 2-run
homer is all the A's offense.

1953
Billy Hunter becomes the last St. Louis Browns player to homer in a game. The
Browns lose anyway, 6-3, to Chicago.

1954
At Yankee Stadium, the A's defeat the Bronx Bombers, 8-6, in the last game
the franchise will play representing Philadelphia. Connie Mack's Athletics,
after spending the first 54 years of existence in the City of Brotherly Love,
will play in Kansas City next season, after much legal wrangling, under
the new ownership of Arnold Johnson. With the Yankees eight games behind
Cleveland on the last day of the season, the Yankees try to set a record for
most wins by a runner-up. Casey Stengel fields a lineup of familiar faces
in unfamiliar places. Yogi Berra plays his only career game at third base,
handling two chances without a miscue, shortstop Mickey Mantle flawlessly
fields eight grounders, and Moose Skowron makes just one error in his eight
opportunities at his new position at second base. Eddie Robinson plays 1B.

In his 2nd start, Brooklyn rookie lefty Karl Spooner shuts out Pittsburgh,
1-0, on a Gil Hodges HR in the 8th. He fans 12 for a total of 27 strikeouts
in his first 2 ML games, establishing a new record. One of his strikeouts
in the 9th is against Dusty Rhodes:  "Before I went up to hit against him,
I told the boys I'd kiss every one of them if he struck me out. Just call
me Liberace." Gil Hodges' 8th-inning HR, his 25th at Ebbets Field (a new
club record), gives him 42 for the season, tying him with Duke Snider for
the most by a Dodger. Hodges also finishes the year with 18 sacrifice flies,
a ML record that won't be topped the rest of the century.

At Milwaukee, Cards rookie Wally Moon hits an 11th-inning 2-run homer
to break a scoreless tie. For Moon it is his last at-bat of the year;
he started the year with a HR in his first at-bat.

Going into the last day of the NL season, Don Mueller leads in hitting with
.3426; Duke Snider is 2nd at .3425, followed by Willie Mays at .3422. The
Giants win, 3-2 in 11 innings, over the Phillies' Robin Roberts, as Mays
garners a single, a double and a triple in 4 ABs. He finishes at .345 while
Mueller, going 2 for 6, slips to .341, the same as the hitless Snider. Richie
Ashburn plays in his 730rd straight game, stretching back to June 7, 1950,
to establish a franchise record. The streak ends on the Opening Day of 1955
due to an injury sustained in spring training.

The Indians lose their last game, 8-7 in 13 innings, to Detroit. Bobby
Avila is 1 for 2 with a HR before being lifted and wins the batting title
with a .341 average. Ted Williams, batting 2nd in today's 11-2 win over
Washington, is 1 for 4 to finish at .344. Teddy Ballgame is 14 at-bats short
of qualifying for the title (adding the 14 in gives him a .333 average)
but drew 136 walks in 117 games.

1956
Vic Wertz of the Indians hits 4 doubles and a single in an 8-4 win against
the Athletics.

Jim Lemon of the Senators sets a ML record for strikeouts by a batter in one
season with 138. This surpasses Larry Doby's mark of 121, set in 1953. The
Senators lose to the Red Sox, 8-4.

In his first ML start, Charlie Beamon of the Orioles throws a 1-0 4-hit
shutout against the Yanks to thwart Whitey Ford's bid for his 20th win. Ford
won't win 20 until 1961.

1958
After today's doubleheader sweep of the Senators, Red Sox teammates Ted
Williams and Pete Runnels are exactly tied for the AL batting leadership at
.32258. Williams is 130 for 403, while Runnels is 180 for 558. Williams is
2 for 3 in the opener, with a HR, then sits in game 2. Runnels is 2 for 9
on the afternoon. The Nats lose, 6-4 and 3-1, to run their loss streak to 11.

Corpus Christi (Texas League) agrees not to use black players in the Dixie
Series with the Southern Association.

1959
Sam Jones holds the Cardinals hitless for seven innings before the game
is called with two outs in the top of the eighth. Although 'Toothpick'
loses his bid for an 'official' no-hitter due to the rain-shortened game,
the Giants' right-hander gets his career-high 21st win of the season with
the Giants' 4-0 victory over the Redbirds at Busch Stadium. HRs by Willie
Mays and Willie McCovey account for the runs.

At Milwaukee the Braves beat the Phillies, 3-2, behind Warren Spahn's 21st
win. He is now ahead of Eppa Rixey as the winningest NL lefty.

The Cubs put the pennant race in a tie by blasting the Dodgers, 12-2, at
Wrigley. The Cubs tally 18 hits in chasing Johnny Podres. A season-ending
three-way tie is now possible.

1961
In New York's 159th game, Roger Maris rips a Jack Fisher fastball into
the RF seats at Yankee Stadium for his 60th HR. New York beats Baltimore,
3-2. There are fewer than 8,000 fans on hand to view this historic event.

Cincinnati clinches its first NL pennant since 1940. Homers by Frank Robinson
and pinch hitter Jerry Lynch, a tie breaker in the 8th, give the Reds a
6-3 win at Chicago. Cincinnati will lose the World Series to the Yankees,
4 games to 1.

1962
The Orioles' Dave McNally makes his first ML start and shuts out the
Royals, 3-0.

Pittsburgh's Earl Francis (9-8) gives up 2 hits in 10 innings in beating the
Reds, 1-0. Jim Maloney matches him for 9 innings. Bob Friend pitches the
11th to earn his 1st save of the year after Mazeroski and Stargell double
home the winning run. Bucs vet Bill Virdon steals his 5th base to go along
with his 13 caught steals, tying him for the NL high with Maury Wills.

The Cubs lose their 101st, but the good news is that only 903 fans are on
hand to see it. The Phils win, 5-3, their 18th win in 23 games. The Phils will
win tomorrow, 8-0, behind Dennis Bennett, and only 607 fans will see that one.

1964
At Shibe Park, the Braves and Phillies set a ML record by using 43 players
in a 9-inning game. The Braves' 25 matches the 9-inning high mark for NL
clubs. Eight of the 25 are pitchers, tying a league mark, but still the
stumbling Phils drop their 6th in a row, 6-4. The topper is Rico Carty's
3-run triple in the top of the 9th against reliever Bobby Shantz, in for
starter Art Mahaffey. Torre again has three hits for Milwaukee, which shaves
the Phils' lead to a half-game.

At RFK Stadium, behind rookie Mel Stottlemyre's 2-hitter, the Yankees roll
over the Senators, 7-0, for their 11th win in a row. Stottlemyre leads the
offense with a ML-record-tying 5 hits, the last pitcher to collect that
many and just the 8th pitcher this century to do so (Jim Callahan of the
White Sox did it twice). With a single in his last at-bat in his last game,
he's had 6 hits in a row.

The Reds belt the Mets, 6-1, for their 7th straight win, the longest in
the NL this season. Marty Keough drives in half the runs with a single and
a double. The Reds are now a half-game in back of the Phils.

Minnesota (formerly the original Senators) clinches their first pennant
since 1933.

The Braves overcome Juan Marichal to beat the Giants, 3-2. Drysdale shuts

the season. The Twins top the Angels, 7-3, behind 2 monster HRs by Harmon
Killebrew, his 42nd and 43rd of the season. Lolich blanks the Yanks, 1-0,
for Detroit to tighten the pennant race. The Twins (91-68) lead with Chicago
(89-68) and the Red Sox (90-69) a game back, and Detroit (89-69) 1 1/2 back.

1969
Pirates skipper Larry Shepard is fired with five games to play and is replaced
on an interim basis by Alex Grammas. Danny Murtaugh, the team's pilot next
season, will win the National League Manager of the Year Award after his
team finishes with 88 victories, just one more win than this year's squad.

1971
At Cleveland Stadium, Jim Palmer blanks the Tribe, 5-0, to become the fourth
Oriole starter this season to capture his 20th victory. The right-hander
joins teammates Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and Pat Dobson, and his feat
makes Baltimore the second team in major league history, along with the
1920 Chicago White Sox, to have four 20-game winners on its staff.

Washington P Denny McLain loses his 22nd game of the season, dropping a
6-3 decision to the Red Sox.

Reynolds, but the Cubs lose, 5-1. It is the last hit of his 19-year ML career.

1972

Champion, relieving in the 2nd, takes his 11th straight defeat.

1973

when the Royals beat Chicago, 6-2. The 26-year-old southpaw will retire in
1984 as the team's all-time leader in victories with 166.

The Twins' Bert Blyleven posts his 2nd one-hitter of the season, beating
the A's, 4-1. Mangual's single in the 5th is the only hit.

In front of a home crowd of 4,804, Jim Colborn wins his 20th for the Brewers,
defeating the Yankees, 5-2. George Scott chips in with 2 RBIs, giving him
100 for the year. Colborn is the Brewers first 20-game winner and the first
in Milwaukee since Tony Cloninger did it for the Braves in 1965.

A $1 million law suit against the Dodgers brought by the parents of a
young fan who was struck and killed by a foul ball in a 1970 game is
dismissed. Alan Fish's parents initially sued the attending doctor and 2
hospitals, but the latter were dismissed early. As noted by Bob Timmerman,
a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Dodgers and Dr. Jones.

1975
Burt Hooton sets a Dodger record for starting pitchers by winning his
twelfth consecutive game. The right-hander accomplishes the feat by beating
J.R. Richard and the Astros, 3-2. Happy's 12 in a row is a Dodger record
for starting pitchers.

At Veteran's Stadium, the Phils top the Mets, 4-3 in 12 innings, in a game
delayed twice by rain. In the 2nd game the Mets are ahead in the third when
the 3rd rain delay finally washes the game away. Only 200 fans are on hand
when the game is called at 3:15 a.m.

Luis Tiant and Reggie Cleveland toss 4-0 shutouts at the Indians in both
ends of doubleheader. This is the first back to back Red Sox shutouts since
1956 and the 2nd in 42 years. Aase and Cleveland will repeat the twinbill
shutout on Sept. 5, 1977 beating the Blue Jays at Toronto, 8-0 and 6-0.

At Wrigley Field, the Expos edge the Cubs, 3-2, with Dale Murray picking
up his 15th win, all in relief. His 15 victories is tops on the staff.

1976
In the last big league games at Jarry Stadium, the Phillies beat the
Expos, 4-1, in the first game of a doubleheader to clinch the NL East
title. Philley takes the nitecap, 2-1. Following the 2nd game, Dick Allen
jumps the team in protest of the fact that veteran Tony Taylor is not listed
on the post-season roster.

1977
In a 9-5 win at St. Louis, the Expos run in a record four pinch-runners in

4-1, to keep a one-game lead over Boston.

1979
Atlanta's Phil Niekro notches his 20th win of the season by beating his
brother Joe, the NL's only other 20-game winner in 1979, 9-4. The Niekro
brothers are the second pair (the other was Jim and Gaylord Perry) to win
20 games in the same year, and Phil Niekro, who finishes at 21-20, is the
first pitcher since Wilbur Wood in 1973 to win and lose 20 games the same
year, and the first NL pitcher to do so since 1905.

Dennis Leonard shuts out California, 4-0, and Royals SS Frank White hits
for the cycle.

1981
Nolan Ryan no-hits the Dodgers, 5-0, to become the only ML pitcher to toss
5 career no-hitters. Ryan had shared the record of 4 with Dodger great Sandy
Koufax, but had not pitched a no-hitter since June 1, 1975. The 34-year-old
Ryan strikes out 11 and retires the last 19 batters in a row while lowering
his league-leading ERA to 1.74.

1982
Down 1-0 to the Braves in the 3rd, Padres OF Gene Richards hits a long
fly ball down the LF line off Rick Camp that Terry Harper spears at the
last second. But Harper's momentum carries him out of bounds where he hits
the railing dropping the ball. Meanwhile the speedy Richards circles the
bases. The ump rules Harper did not hold the ball long enough for an out
and he is charged with a 4-base error (later overruled by the League office
to an inside-the-park HR for Richards). The Padres win the game, 3-2.

1983
Cardinals Bob Forsch pitches his 2nd career no-hitter, winning 3-0 against
the Expos. Forsch allows just 2 base runners while becoming the first
Cardinal and 25th pitcher overall to throw more than one no-hitter.

1984
Philadelphia's Juan Samuel breaks Tim Raines' record for steals by a rookie
with his 72nd in a 7-1 loss to the Mets. Raines had set the record of 71
in the strike-shortened 1981 season. The 2nd place Mets are the first team
to finish above .500 and score fewer runs than their opponents in a full
season since the 1932 Pirates.

1985
The Cards' John Tudor picks up his 20th win of the season with his ML-leading
10th shutout, a 5-0 four-hitter against the Phillies. It's the most in 10
years and the most by a lefty since Koufax in 1963.

1986
California clinches the AL West title with an 8-3 win over Texas. Brian
Downing belts 2 homeruns for the Angels.

1987
Padres catcher Benito Santiago sets a major league record for rookies by
hitting safely in his 28th consecutive contest, a streak the 21-year-old
backstop will extend to 34 games. Pirates third baseman Jimmy Williams had
set the previous mark of 27 in 1899 with the Pirates. The Dodgers beat the
Padres today, 3-1.

1988
The Dodgers beat the Padres, 3-2, to clinch the NL West title and earn a
playoff date with the Mets, who won 10 of their 11 meetings this season.

wrapping up the NL East with a 3-2 win over the Expos. Mitch Williams
strikes out Mike Fitzgerald to win the game.

1992
The Mets lose to the Pirates, 19-2 as the Bucs collect 20 hits, including
homers by Bonds and Van Slyke. Van Slyke adds a triple and McLendon has
a homer and 4 RBIs. IF Bill Pecota pinch hits and pitches the last inning
for NY, becoming the first position player ever to hurl an inning for the
Mets. He gives up one hit (a HR to Andy Van Slyke) and one run.

Greg Vaughn's HR in the 6th is the difference in the Brewers' 2-1 win over
the A's. Milwaukee's Pat Listach draws a walk after taking 17 pitches from
A's starter Ron Darling. He's cut down stealing. Reliever Jesse Orosco is
the winner over his former Met teammate.

Richard Seitz, creator of the APBA baseball game, dies at the age of 77.

1993
Seattle P Randy Johnson strikes out Ruben Sierra of the Athletics for
his 300th strikeout of the season, making him the 12th pitcher this

defeat the Reds, 12-7.

1994
The Baltimore Orioles fire manager Johnny Oates.

1995
Adam Sisk becomes the first player signed by the expansion Tampa Bay Devil
Rays. The 19-year-old Edison Community College student, who was 24-2 as
a high schooler at Riverdale Baptist, was drafted by San Diego last year,
but the right-hander chose to go to college where he developed tendinitis
in his right elbow after making just two appearances.

1996
Oakland C Terry Steinbach hits a 6th-inning HR in a 7-5 victory over Seattle,
giving the Athletics their 241st HR of the season. They become the 2nd team
this season to surpass the mark formerly held by the 1961 Yankees.

1997
In a 10-4 win over the Rockies, Dodger catcher Mike Piazza hits the longest
homerun in the history of Coors Field. The 28-year-old backstop's sixth-inning
blast travels 496 feet and hits the left center field billboard between
the scoreboard and Rockpile.

Four Yankees pitchers combine to 1-hit the Tigers, winning by a score of
8-2. Andy Pettitte starts and allows a 2-run single to Travis Fryman in the
3rd inning, giving Detroit a 2-1 lead. Pettitte leaves after 4 frames and
is succeeded by Brian Boehringer (3 innings), Mariano Rivera (1 inning)
and Jeff Nelson (1 inning). Rivera receives credit for the win when NY
explodes for 6 runs in the 9th inning.

In the 7th at Shea, Atlanta SS Rafael Belliard hits his first homer in a
decade, off Brian Bohannon, to tie the Mets at 6 apiece. His last came on
May 5, 1987, off Eric Show of the Padres. Atlanta wins, 7-6 in 11 innings.

1998
Rickey Henderson, 39, steals his 66th base of the season. The all-time stolen
base leader is the oldest player to ever steal more than 50 bases in a season.

Phillies P Curt Schilling strikes out 7 batters to reach the 300 mark in
the season. He thus becomes the 5th pitcher in major league history to fan
300 or more in consecutive seasons. Florida wins in the 10th, 4-3, on Dave
Berg's 2-out double. The Phillies also lose the nightcap, 1-0 in 13 innings,
when Alex Gonzalez hits a game-ending HR off Ricky Bottalico.

The Yankees defeat the Devil Rays, 3-1, for David Cone's 20th win of the
year. Cone sets a record for the most years (10) between 20-win seasons,
having won 20 for the Mets in 1988. Jim Kaat held the previous record
at 9. Shane Spencer homers, his 6th in 9 days and his 7th in the month,
a Yankee rookie record.

as the Cubs edge Houston, 3-2. Gary Gaetti has 2 RBIs while Jeff Bagwell
hits his 34th for the Astros.

The hot Giants rip the Rockies, 8-4, to stay tied with the Cubs for the
wild card. Orel Hershiser wins his 11th, despite allowing 8 hits in 5+
innings. One of the hits is Larry Walker's 23rd homer, and he adds another
two hits to run his average to .362.

In a 5-2 loss to the Orioles at Fenway, Dennis Eckersley gets a standing
ovation from the Fenway crowd as he appears in his 1,071st game, breaking
Hoyt Wilhelm's record for most appearances. It will be the Eck's final
game. When the Red Sox refuse arbitration after the season, Eckersley
retires on December 10.

1999
The Cardinals lose to the Reds, 7-5, despite Mark McGwire's 60th HR of the
season. McGwire joins Sammy Sosa as the only players in history to reach the
60 homer mark twice. Big Mac will end the season with 147 RBIs on 145 hits,
the only player in ML history (with 100 hits in a season) to have more ribbies
than hits. Jay Buhner, in 1995, came closest with 121 RBIs and 123 hits (.984)

2000
The Braves defeat the Mets, 7-1, to clinch the NL East for their record
9th straight division title.

2001

hit in the opening inning.

2002
Livan Hernandez (12-16) pitches a masterful 2-hitter as the Giants beat
the Padres, 6-0. Hernandez is tied with Ben Sheets for the most losses in
the NL. The Giants stay 3 games ahead of LA for the wild card spot. Reggie
Sanders connects twice for homers, and Barry Bonds walks in his 16th straight
game to tie Jack Clark's NL record set in 1987. He's walked 194 times;
he'll end the year with 198 passes, a new ML record topping Ruth's mark of
1923. Bonds will finish with a .582 on-base percentage, easily topping the
old mark of .553 that Ted Williams had set in 1941.

2003
The Marlins defeat the Mets, 4-3, to clinch the NL wild-card spot in the
playoffs.

Yankee rookie P Jorge De Paula makes his ML debut with 6 1/3 hitless innings
against the Baltimore Orioles in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. He is
removed after allowing a single to Larry Bigbie, but does not get a decision
as the Orioles win, 3-2 in 10 innings. New York takes the opener, 11-2.

The White Sox down the Royals, 11-2. KC's Carlos Beltran hits a leadoff
homer in the 4th to become just the 6th player since 1900 to have 100 runs,
100 RBIs and 30 stolen bases in three seasons.

2004
In a bench-clearing game at Fenway, the Red Sox down the Yankees, 11-4. Curt
Schilling pitches 7 innings of one-hit ball, while the Red Sox jump on
Kevin Brown in the 1st and Estaban Loaiza in the 2nd inning to post a
7-0 lead. Pedro Astacio, Brad Halsey and Joe Torre all get tossed in the
8th. Bill Mueller homers for Boston while Andy Phillips, in his first ML

hit a homer on his first at-bat.

The Athletics use 19 hits to down the Mariners, 12-3, to clinch the AL West
crown. Jason Kendall and Jay Payton each have 4 hits, and Kendall adds a
stolen base.

The Cubs trim the Brewers, 14-6, in a game that shows an odd line score:
only one team scores in each inning. The Cubs, with 18 hits, plate runs in
the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th; Milwaukee scores in the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.

Astros P Andy Pettitte allows 10 hits but just three runs in 6 2/3 innings
as Houston beats Pittsburgh, 7-4. The win pushes Pettitte's record to
14-13. He has never had a losing or even a .500 season, the only pitcher
with at least 10 seasons other than Babe Ruth who has done that.

2007
Big League umpire Mike Winters is suspended for the remainder of the season
without pay for his actions during a confrontation with Milton Bradley
in the eighth inning of the Rockies-Padres game at PETCO Park. After an
investigation of the incident which occurred three days ago, the first base
ump, who ejected the Padres outfielder with a profanity-laden accusation,
allegedly incited Bradley to the point the player needed to be restrained
resulting in a season-ending injury.

At Miller Park, Albert Pujols becomes the only player in big league history
to hit 30 homers and have 100 RBIs in each of his first seven seasons. The
Cardinal first baseman's first-inning homer helps St. Louis beat the
contending Brewers, 7-3.

As the result of a internet poll conducted by Marc Ecko, who owns the historic
horsehide, the record-breaking 756th homerun baseball belted by Barry Bonds,
will be donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame branded with an asterisk. The
fashion designer, who made the announcement on the 'Today' show, revealed
47% voted for the ball to be marked with another 34% voting to donate it
unchanged, and 19% elected to send the special sphere into outer space.

After a 50 homer-less at-bat drought, Brandon Phillips hits his 30th homerun
of the season to become the 31st member of the 30-30 club, which now includes
Mets third baseman David Wright and Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins who
also accomplished the feat this season. The 26-year-old infielder becomes
only the 2nd second baseman (Alfonso Soriano - Yankees, 2002) and third
Reds player (Eric Davis, 1987 and Barry Larkin, 1996) to hit 30 homeruns
and steal 30 bases in the same season.

During the New Hampshire presidential primary debate, moderator Tim Russert
asks candidate Hillary Clinton who she would root for in a potential Cubs
vs. Yankees World Series. The senator from New York, an Illinois native,
responds diplomatically, "I would probably have to alternate sides".

2008
Although they suffer a 6-4 loss to the Tigers, the Rays win their first
American League East title when the Red Sox lose to the Yankees later
in the evening. Skipper Joe Maddon and just a few players remain in the
Comerica Park club house to watch the end of the rain-delayed contest in
Boston which brings the title to Tampa Bay.

2009
Bronx native Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court's newest member, throws the
ceremonial first pitch at Yankee Stadium, a strike right down the middle
of the plate, prior to watching her team defeat the Red Sox, 3-0. In 1995,
Justice Sotomayor, as a U.S. District Judge, issued an injunction which
led to ending the nearly eight month-long baseball strike.

2010
In their last game played in Detroit this season, the Tigers establish a
Comerica Park record when they beat Minnesota, 5-1, for their 52nd victory
at home, one more win than in the ballpark's inaugural season in 2000. The
club, however, is unable to contend this year due to its poor performance
on the road, presently 19 games below .500.

2011
With a single up the middle, Vladimir Guerrero becomes the all-time career
hit leader among players born in the Dominican Republic. The 36-year-old
Orioles DH's 2,587th career hit puts him ahead of Hato Mayor del Rey native
Julio Franco.

2012
David Wright, the franchise leader in doubles, extra-base hits, walks, RBIs
and runs scored, breaks the record for most hits in Mets history when he
beats out a slow grounder down the third base line for an infield single
in the team's 6-0 victory over Pittsburgh at Citi Field. The 29-year-old
third baseman's 1,419th career hit surpasses Ed Kranepool, a first baseman
and outfielder who played for New York from 1962 to 1979.

2013
Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte, with two out in the ninth inning, emerge from
the dugout to take out legendary closer Mariano Rivera, giving the sold-out
crowd at Yankee Stadium one last chance to cheer their beloved reliever. The
unexpected visit to the mound, the brainchild of manager Joe Girardi,
who asked permission from the umpires to implement the unorthodox move,
triggers an emotional encounter between the remaining Core Four teammates that
renders Mo speechless as he weeps from the adulation of his friends and fans.

Commissioner Bud Selig announces his intention to retire upon the completion
of his contract, scheduled to expire at the end of next year. The 79-year-old
chief executive of baseball has held the position since 1992, first on
an interim basis, before being named permanently to the post nearly six
years later.

2014
The Royals clinch their first postseason berth in nearly three decades with
a 3-1 win over the White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field. The Cinderella American
League Wild Card team will win three postseason series, beating Oakland,
Los Angeles and Baltimore, to make it to the Fall Classic, before losing
to San Francisco in seven games.

2015
Unbeknownst to the Blue Jays at the time, the team technically clinched a
postseason spot yesterday. After fans crunch the numbers after the game to
discover the oversight, the team and MLB review the results and officially
confirm the end of the longest playoff drought in North American professional
sports, ending Toronto's 22-year absence from the postseason which will be
celebrated in a champagne-soaked clubhouse celebration after today's 10-8
victory over Tampa Bay at the Roger Centre.

The Mets clinch their first NL East title and first postseason berth since
2006 when the team routs Cincinnati at the Great American Ball Park,
10-2. New York, needing only an 88-67 record to capture the flag, took
advantage of the season-long woes of the heavily-favored Nationals.

2018
German Marquez of Colorado tied a modern Major League record (since 1900)
by fanning the first eight Philadelphia Phillies he faced. He tied a record
that is shared by Jim Deshaies and Jacob deGrom.

2019
With Jonathan Schoop's homerun against the Detroit Tigers, the Twins became
the first team in Major League history to hit 300 homeruns in a season.

starter in MLB history to make at least 13 home starts without a losing
decision and an ERA below 2.00 in a season.
