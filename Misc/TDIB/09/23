1901
At League Park, Brooklyn ties their highest score ever (May 20, 1896)
in blasting the Reds, 25-6. These are the most runs they will score this
century. Jimmy Sheckard and Joe Kelley both connect for grand slams, with
Kelley adding a 2nd homer. Jim Hughes collects 4 hits and a win while Tom
Daly scores 5 runs. Starter Archie Stimmel (4-14 for the season) gives up
18 runs in 5 innings.

Doc McJames, who pitched for Brooklyn last year (5-6) dies after he falls
out of a carriage in Charleston, SC. He was 28.

1902
Boston beats the Giants, 2-1, with both runs scoring on wild pitches by
Christy Mathewson.

Cy Young eases to his 32nd win as Boston pounds the A's, 14-1.

1904
The Giants sleepwalk against the Pirates ("Pittsburg Plays All By Itself"
is the NY Herald headline) as Red Ames allows 3 runs in 8 innings before
John McGraw pulls him. His replacement is Frank Bowerman who gives up 4
runs in his only ML inning. The Pirates win, 7-0.

1905
Detroit rookie Ty Cobb, 18, hits his first HR, off Cy Falkenberg, an
inside-the-park blow, in an 8-5 loss at Washington.

In Chicago, Mathewson and Carl Lundgren hook up in a tight pitchers' duel,
decided in Chicago's favor on a mental error by Giants SS Bill Dahlen. With
two on and two outs in the 5th inning, Dahlen bobbles a grounder and touches
2B as the runner arrives. Dahlen, thinking that he has the 3rd out, rolls the
ball to the mound. But ump Bob Emslie calls the runner safe. Johnny Evers,
the runner on 3B, alertly scores on the play for the game's only run. The
loss stops Matty's win streak at 11 games.

1907
At the start of the Giants match in Pittsburgh, John McGraw hands Bill Klem
the lineup card with Bresnahan's name in the lineup. The two argue about
whether the catcher can play after yesterday's ejection and then when Klem
turns away he is hit in the face with a glass of water. No culprit comes
forward but Klem gets his revenge in the 6th inning by ejecting McGraw and
Art Devlin for arguing a call. The Pirates win, 2-1.

In Chicago, the Cubs clinch the pennant by beating the Phillies, 4-1. The
game is washed out after 7 1/2 innings with Ed Reulbach winning in relief
of Three Finger Brown. Chicago pulls off a triple play in the 5th inning
to help seal the win.

In a field day at Ponce de Leon park in Atlanta, Dyer wins the 100-yeard-dash
in 10 seconds flat, and Dode Paskert wins at circling the bases (14.15
seconds) tying a mark set by Walter Clements in Cincinnati. Cobb will
top it next year. Paskert also wins the long throw with a heave of 368
feet. Paskert, who was eliminated in the 100-year-dash, runs an exhibition
in 10 seconds flat.

1908
The Chicago Cubs and New York Giants, involved in a tight pennant race,
(also involving the Pittsburgh Pirates) were tied in the bottom of the
ninth inning at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants had runners on
first and third and two outs when Al Bridwell hit a single to center field,
scoring Moose McCormick from third with the Giants' apparent winning run,
but the runner on first base, rookie Fred Merkle, thinking the game was over,
went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick
touched home plate. As fans swarmed the field, Cub infielder Johnny Evers
retrieved the ball and touched second. A forceout was called at second base,
nullifying the single, and because there were 2 outs when the play started,
the run was also nullified and the inning ended. The game was declared a
tie and would be made up at the end of the season if the Cubs and Giants
were tied for first place. The incident became known as "The Merkle Boner".
Merkle's 'boner' will eventually cost the Giants the flag.

Giants P Mathewson and Cubs P Three Finger Brown battle in the most
controversial game ever played. The score is 1-1 with 2 outs in the last
of the 9th. The Giants' Harry McCormick is on 3B and Fred Merkle (19, and
making his first start of the year, is subbing for the sore-legged veteran
Fred Tenney) is on 1B. Al Bridwell singles, scoring McCormick. Halfway to 2B,
Merkle turns and heads for the clubhouse in CF. Johnny Evers secures a ball
(Joe McGinnity swears he picked up the ball that was in play and threw it into
the stands) and touches 2B as the crowd overruns the field. Umpire O'Day at
1B claims he didn't see the play, but that evening he rules the run does not
count, and the game ended with a tie score. (Years later, in an interview,
Merkle will describe it this way: "When Bridwell shot that long single, I
started across the grass for the clubhouse. Matty was near me. When Evers
began shouting for the ball, he noticed something was wrong. Matty caught
me by the arm and told me to wait a minute. We walked over toward 2B, and
Matty spoke to Emslie. 'How about this, Bob, is there any trouble with the
score of the play?' 'It's all right,' said Emslie. 'You've got the game. I
don't see anything wrong with the play.' Matty then took me by the arm and
we walked to the clubhouse confident that we had won the game.")

The Pirates win their 7th victory in 10 games by topping Brooklyn, 2-1,
behind Lefty Leifield. Wilhelm takes the loss. Pittsburgh is now a game in
back of first place.

Cleveland wins its 10th straight game, defeating the Yankees and Jack Chesbro,
9-3. The Naps score 5 runs in the 7th, while Rhoades pitches strong ball
until the 9th, when he allows 2 runs. Nap Lajoie has no official at-bats,
getting hit by pitched balls 3 times, tying an AL record, and walking his
other time up.

1910
George Stallings, convinced that Hal Chase tried to throw a game, but unable
to make the charge stick, is replaced by his charismatic first sacker as
manager of the 2nd-place Highlanders for the season's final 11 games. On
his own, Prince Hal will lead the New Yorkers downhill to 6th place in 1911.

1911
Walter Johnson gives up a 2-run homer in the 6th inning to Joe Jackson,
the 8th four-bagger the Big Train has allowed this year. Johnson had given
up just 2 in the previous 4 seasons. Cleveland whips the Senators, 6-1.

Mathewson pitches the Giants to a 6-2 win over the Reds. New York now leads
Chicago by 8 games.

1912
In Boston, 100,000 fans are on hand to greet the Red Sox after their western
road trip. All business stops as the players ride from South station to the
Common where Mayor Fitzgerald welcomes them. The players are given the keys
to the city. Extra seating is added to Fenway Park, increasing the seating
capacity to 32,000 for the WS.

1913
The Athletics hit no homers against the visiting Tigers, but still manage
to win, 21-8, after scoring 10 runs in the 2nd inning. Detroit scores 4 in
the frame for an AL record 14 for the 2nd inning. Jimmy Walsh scores 5 runs
for the A's.

1914
After losing game 1 to Boston, 3-2, the last-place Reds come back in game
2 to break the longest losing streak in the club's history (and 3rd longest
in the NL and tying the 20th-Century mark of the 1906 Boston Nationals) at
19 straight. Charles "King" Lear wins his only game of the year and pitches
his only shutout ever, 3-0. The Reds wait till the 9th to score their 3 runs.

Rube Marquard loses his 12th in a row, as the Cards sink the Giants twice,
but the Cards fall short of overtaking New York in 2nd place by 2 1/2 games.

Pete Alexander coasts to a 9-4 win over the Cubs as Gavvy Cravath bangs
two homers to lead the Phils' offense.

1915
In the first of two games, the Yanks top the Browns, 7-0. George Sisler
pitches one perfect inning of relief for St. Louis.

Before the game at Pittsburgh, manager Fred Clarke is presented with
a grandfather clock and a red leather binder signed by thousands of
well-wishers. Clarke plays 4 innings in left field and goes 1 for 2. After
reaching first, Clarke is replaced by Max Carey, and the out-going manager
exits to thunderous applause. Pittsburgh wins, 8-4, over the Braves.

In Chicago, Phillies ace Pete Alexander wins his 30th, beating the Cubs, 5-1.

In Philadelphia, Detroit's Ty Cobb swipes his 90th base of the year. Only
300 fans are on hand to witness the event. Detroit wins, 6-5.

1916
Grover Cleveland Alexander beats Cincinnati twice 7-3 and 4-0 at
Philadelphia, allowing just 1 walk in the two 9-inning contests. Gavvy
Cravath has 6 consecutive hits in the two games. With the Phillies needing
the catch a train, Alex finishes the nitecap in 58 minutes, his 5th
shutout and 8th victory over the Reds this season, a NL record. Pete has
now thrown 15 shutouts on the year, also a NL and ML record. Tom Hughes,
in 1905, whitewashed the Indians 5 times. Alexander will win both ends
of a doubleheader again on September 3, 1917 against the Brooklyn Robins
(Dodgers) at Ebbets Field.

Series bound Boston beats Cleveland, 5-3, behind Carl Mays. Duffy Lewis is
5 for 5 with two spectacular catches in the field. He turns the 2nd into a DP.

1917
Deja Vu all over again. Grover Alexander beats Chicago's Shufflin Phil
Douglas, this time 4-1, their 2nd matchup in three days.

1920
In a 3-game showdown in Cleveland to decide the pennant, White Sox hurler
Dickie Kerr tops the Indians, 10-3, beating 29-game winner Jim Bagby. The
Sox, winners of their last 7, are now just a half-game behind Cleveland.

1921
Trailing by 2 points, the Indians come to New York for a 4-game
showdown. Waite Hoyt's arm and Ruth's 3 doubles beat them, 4-2.

1922
Rogers Hornsby belts his 40th homer, a solo shot in the 6th at the Polo
Grounds, but the Giants hang on to win, 7-5. Ross Youngs saves a homer in
the 9th when he leaps to snag Jack Smith's drive. Jack Scott is 4 for 4
and pitches all the way for the win to keep the Giants six games in front
of Pittsburgh.

Brooklyn makes the fading Pirates walk the plank, beating Pittsburgh 9-5
and 5-1.

1923
In Atlanta, the wooden Ponce De Leon Park, home of the Crackers (South
Association) burns down in a spectacular blaze. There is only one injury -
a secretary who had fallen asleep in the front office is resuced but suffers
burns. The park will be rebuilt in steel and concrete, renamed Spiller Park
after the club president, and reopen for the 1924 season.

1925
The Pirates clinch the NL pennant, making 6 double plays in beating the
Phils, 2-1. Cuyler is 1 for 2.

Washington SS Roger Peckinpaugh, a .294 hitter, is named the AL MVP with
45 points; A's OF Al Simmons is 2nd with 41.

1930
Pennant-bound St. Louis hands Flint Rhem an 11-0 lead, but he can't hold it
against the Phils. There are 42 hits in the contest as the Cards stagger
to a 19-16 win at Philadelphia. The Cardinals set a franchise record
collecting 26 hits. (It will be another seventy-eight years before the
Redbirds have an equal amount of hits in a game.) In the stands scouting
the Redbirds are Connie Mack and several A's players. Chuck Klein, an expert
in handling the rebounds off the RF wall at the Baker Bowl, makes his 44th
assist, well above the record of 39 set by Mike Mitchell with the Reds in
1907. The Phils' pitching staff, as they've done every year since 1918,
will post the NL's highest ERA mark ... this year 6.702 is the all-time
high. The batting average for the entire NL at the Baker Bowl this year is
.350. Klein's average at home is .439 for the season.

1932
Trailing 8-6 to Cleveland after 5 innings, White Sox reliever Bill Chamberlain
gives up 5 runs to start the 6th. In disgust, Sox manager Lou Fonseca, an
infielder-outfielder throughout his career, inserts himself as pitcher. With
2 runners on, he retires all 3 batters he faces, then turns the ball over
to Chad Kimsey to finish the game. The Tribe wins, 13-6, as Wes Ferrell
wins his 23rd.

1933
The Cubs beat the Reds, 7-1, with Paul Derringer losing his 27th game
for the last-place Reds, the most losses since George Bell (Brooklyn)
in 1910. Gabby Hartnett hits a grand slam for the Cubs.

Despite the 5th-place Tigers' 5-3 win over the Browns, manager Bucky Harris
submits his resignation. Babe Ruth's name will be prominent in the newspapers
as a possible replacement.

The Yankees make 5 errors, 3 by Frank Crosetti, but have enough firepower
to outslug the Red Sox, 16-12. Included in New York's 23 hits are homers by
Ruth and Gehrig, number 31 for each. Lou adds two doubles and a single. Byrd,
Chapman and Crosetti have three hits apiece, and reliever Wilcy Moore drives
in the last run with his first hit of the year. The Red Sox chase winning
pitcher Herb Pennock in the 6th, but fall short at the end.

The Phils and Braves split a twinbill, each winning 5-4. Chuck Klein has three
hits in each game, including his NL-high 28th homer in the opener. Boston's
Wally Berger, 2nd in homers with 26, is out of action and doesn't play today.

1934
The Yankees keep their mathematical chances alive with a double win over the
visiting Red Sox, but most of the cheers are for Babe Ruth. The Babe is 0 for
4 with a walk in the opener, a 1-0 three hitter spun by Lefty Gomez. Arndt
Jorgens knocks in the only run, off George Hockette, to give Gomez his 26th
win. In the nitecap, Boston scores 4 in the 5th, but the Yankees tie it on
Lou Gehrig's 47th homer of the year. In the last of the 9th, Ruth emerges
from the dugout as a pinch hitter, but lines out. New York then scores
the winner in the 10th on Chapman's single. Red Ruffing is the starter and
winner. George Selkirk has five hits, including a homer, in the two games.

The Tigers remain in first place by 5 1/2 games, splitting a pair with
the Browns. St. Louis beats Schoolboy Rowe in the opener, 4-3, then Alvin
Crowder outduels George Blaeholder, 2-1, in game 2.

The Cards beat the Reds, 9-7, then lose, 4-3, as the Deans falter. In the 9th
Dizzy Dean relieves Paul after the Reds score a run. Diz walks two to load
the bases, and Mark Koenig hits a sac fly to bring home the winner. It is the
first Card defeat in eight games and leaves the Birds 2 1/2 behind the Giants.

The Giants split a pair with the Braves to remain even with the Cards. New
York takes the opener, 8-0, behind Roy Parmelee. In game 2, Carl Hubbell
gives up no hits through 5 innings, but he wilts in the 8th and the Braves
score 3. Boston wins it in the 11th, 4-3, scoring a run off Joe Bowman on
a 2-out single, steal, wild pitch and single.

The White Sox drop a pair to the Indians and run their loss streak to 8
games. Monte Pearson edges out recruit pitcher Vern Kennedy in the opener,
2-1, then Ralph Winegarner wins the 2nd, 5-1. He's aided by Earl Averill's
30th homer with two on. Earl boosts his homerun bonus money to $3,000;
he received a $1,000 bonus for his 25th and $400 for each clout after that.

1935
With the Cubs idle, the Pirates beat up on the Cards and rookie Ed Heusser
to win, 12-0. Big Jim weaver allows 4 hits in the shutout.

1936
Pitching in the 10th straight Giants game, Carl Hubbell notches his 16th
consecutive victory, his 26th of the year. King Carl beats the Phils,
5-4. He resumes the streak next year to reach a record 24 wins in a row.

Hal Trosky hits his 42nd homer of the year to lead Cleveland to a 17-8
win in the opener with the White Sox. Trosky finishes with 36 walks, the
first major leaguer with 40 or more homers and fewer than 40 passes. In the
nitecap Luke Appling has four hits, including a homer off Bob Feller, to
sew up the AL batting title. Runner-up Earl Averill is held hitless. Appling
will coast to a 10-point margin at .388. Feller fans ten.

1937
The Yankees lose, 9-5, to the Browns but clinch the pennant when the Red Sox
beat Detroit. Lou Gehrig's 1st-inning RBI is his 150th of the year. Gehrig
has now driven in 150 or more runs, 7 times to set a new ML mark. Babe Ruth
did it 6 times.

The Giants collect 17 hits again and beat the Cubs, 8-7, to go up by 3 1/2
games. Though routed, Carl Hubbell wins his 21st in relief.

1938
The Cubs take a pair from the host Phillies, winning 3-2 and 7-6. Augie
Galan's 8th-inning dinger is key in the opener, while in the 2nd game
Ripper Collins' towering fly in the 9th with the bases loaded is misplayed
by CF Gib Brack for a double. The Cubs catch an overnight train for their
rendezvous with the Cardinals tomorrow.

The Reds trim the Pirates, 5-4 in 12 innings, cutting Pittsburgh's lead to
2 games.

For the 10th time this season, Hank Greenberg homers twice in a game, hitting
his 55th and 56th of the year, but the Tigers lose, 6-5 in 7 innings. Game
one of the twinbill is also a loss, 8-1, to Bob Feller. Feller strikes out
10 and walks 1.

1939
In the first game of a twin bill, Brooklyn's third baseman Cookie Lavagetto
reaches base seven consecutive times as the Dodgers rout the Phillies,
22-4. Lavagetto goes 6 for 6 with 4 singles, a double, a triple and a
walk. The 26-run Shibe Park contest only takes two hours five minutes
to complete.

1940
Before a Wrigley crowd of 1,843, Claude Passeau notches his 20th win as he
scatters four Cardinal hits. Passeau helps his cause with a homerun in the
10-0 romp.

Despite stranding 11 runners in the first 7 innings, Brooklyn beats the
visiting Giants, 3-2, scoring 2 in the 8th and 1 in the 9th. Dolph Camilli
homers into the CF bleachers with 2 outs in the 9th. Winning P Tex Carleton
relieves in the 9th with runners on 2B and 3B and one out. He intentionally
walks PH Joe Moore to load the bases. He sprawls snagging Johnny McCarthy's
popped bunt attempt for one out and then scrambles to 1B to complete the
unassisted DP.

1941
With the Dodgers idle, the Cardinals lose the critical opener of two to the
Pirates, dropping St. Louis two games back. Pirate hurler Ken Heintzelman
allows just 6 hits. The Birds win the nitecap, 9-0, as Musial has three hits,
including his first homer, off Luke Sewell.

A triple by Eddie Collins Jr triggers a two-run ninth inning rally as the
A's beat the Yankees, 9-8. Red Ruffing takes the loss, despite hitting a
homer, triple and single and driving in 3 runs. Four errors by NY, three by
second baseman Joe Gordon, help the A's. Joe Dimaggio homers and collects
two RBIs in his RBI race with idle Charlie Keller. Bill Dickey plays four
innings to set a ML record of catching 100 games in each of 13 seasons,
breaking the previous standard of 12 set by Gabby Hartnett and Ray Schalk.

1942
In Brooklyn, Larry French, 35, pitches a brilliant one-hitter, allowing just
Nick Etten's 2nd-inning infield hit, and beating the Philadelphia Phillies,
6-0. Etten is retired on a DP as French faces just 27 batters in his 197th
and last career win (197-171, with 40 shutouts). There are 13,346 fans on
hand, 8,647 of which are admitted free by bringing with them 10 pounds of
iron for the war effort. French finishes the year at 15-4 with a 1.83 ERA,
and after a brief relief stint on the 26th, he'll enlist in the Navy. He'll
be stationed at the Brooklyn Navy Yards, but his petition to the Navy to
allow him spot starts with the Dodgers will be denied. "I still need three
winning games to paste 200 in my scrapbook," says French. "I want them,
and I won't be satisfied with my career until I get them." Despite his
disappointment, French will stay in the Navy, rise through the ranks and
retire in 1969 with the rank of captain. Larry MacPhail, the 52-year-old
Dodger president, also announces today that he is quitting at the end of
the season to reenter the army.

At St. Louis, the Cards maintain their two-game lead as Johnny Beazley
stops the Reds, 4-2, on 2 hits. It is his 20th win.

1945
To make Griffith Stadium available for pro football, the Senators finish their
season early, playing their last 2 games of the year in Philadelphia. The
A's tie the Nats 3-3 in the 8th, then win it in the 12th, 4-3, on a fly
ball that OF Bingo Binks loses in the sun and it drops for a double. Bingo
neglects to don sunglasses after the sun breaks through the clouds. Kell
singles home the winner. The Senators win the night cap, 4-3, but their
season ends with them one game behind the Tigers at 87-67.

The Tigers lose to Nels Potter, 5-0, garnering only 2 hits off the Browns'
ace.

After being honored in a pre-game ceremony on Andy Pafko Day, Pafko hits
his 2nd slam of the month, off Preacher Roe in the 1st inning of game 1
in Chicago. The Cubs beat the Pirates, 7-3, with Hank Wyse winning over
Roe. The nitecap is rained out. The win keeps the Cubs 1 1/2 games ahead
of the Cards, winners over the Reds.

The Phillies salvage a split with the Dodgers after making only one hit -
by Rene Monteagudo - off Hal Gregg in a 9-0 first game loss. The Phils take
the nitecap, 4-3.

honor of his 20 years with the Giants. The Braves then sweep two from Ott's
boys, winning 4-1 and 7-3.

1947
Working 5 innings in a Series tune-up, Joe Hatten wins his 17th game and
his first against a first-division team, as the Dodgers beat the Giants,
6-1. Dan Bankhead finishes. In a pre-game ceremony, Jackie Robinson receives
a car, a TV set, a $500 watch and other gifts.

1948
In Chicago, the last place White Sox, behind thirty-year-old journeyman

Sox and Indians are idle.

1949
Before the game, Cleveland owner Bill Veeck and a few players holds funeral
services to bury the 1948 pennant in center field. Yesterday, the Tribe
were mathematically eliminated from the American League pennant race.

With yesterday's rainout, New York plays a doubleheader with the
Senators. Washington takes the opener, 9-8 in 10 innings, when Sid
Hudson's pop fly off Joe Page falls between Tommie Henrich and 2B George
Stirnweiss. Fred Sanford salvages the 2nd game for New York, winning 7-1.

1950
The Athletics erupt for 12 runs against the Senators in the 6th inning to
win, 16-5. Reserve catcher Joe Astroth hits his first homer, a grand slam
off Julio Moreno, and a single and knocks in a since-topped ML record 6
runs in the big inning. Astroth had 22 RBIs in 104 games prior to today.

In what amounts to a political and monetary act of leverage, Brooklyn's
Branch Rickey offers to sell his 25 percent interest to real estate mogul
William Zeckendorf.

The Braves' Johnny Sain fails in his attempt to win his 20th game, but hits
his first ML HR, off Larry Jansen in the 8th, in a 4-3 loss to the visiting
Giants. With two outs in the 10th, Sam Jethroe loses Don Mueller's fly ball
in the sun and Mueller legs out a triple. Hank Thompson's single wins it
for Larry Jansen. A Saturday crowd of 5,535 watch the Tribe drop out of
2nd place, while the Giants move to within three games of the Phils.

the 1st-place Phils.

The Yankees, tied for 1st place with the Tigers and 2 games ahead of

8-0. Ed Lopat gives up 5 hits, including a leadoff triple to Dom DiMaggio,
in posting his 100th career win.

Easter a 3-run double.

1951

game in beating the Braves, 4-1, despite allowing 13 hits. It is the most
victories by a Giant since Hubbell in 1937.

Roy Campanella has 4 hits, including a homer off 15-game winner Bubba
Church, and the Dodgers top the Phillies, 6-3. Preacher Roe is the winner,
his record going to an amazing 22-2.

Pittsburgh's Murry Dickson wins his 20th game, a 3-0 whitewash of the

the sacks full. The Yankees, who will lose the World Series to Brooklyn in
seven games, will finish the season three games in front of Cleveland.

After a running feud with owner Charlie Comiskey Jr, Frank Lane resigns as
GM of the White Sox. He had been GM for 7 years.

plays third base for the Giants.

Pittsburgh and Brooklyn draw the largest crowd, 44,932, in Forbes Field
history. Curfew stops the game with 2 outs in the 9th and Brooklyn leading,

since starting the year 4-10.

1957
The Milwaukee Braves clinch the pennant by beating the Cardinals, 4-2,
on Hank Aaron's 11th-inning HR. Billy Moffett serves up the HR pitch, his
only gopher ball all season. The homer, Aaron's 43rd, comes with 2 outs
and Johnny Logan on base. This is the first time since 1950 that a New York
team hasn't finished first. Aaron will win the 1957 NL MVP.

At Washington, with VP Nixon in attendance, Ted Williams reaches base 5
times to run his consecutive on-base streak to a record 16 in the Red Sox'
9-4 win. He has two singles, 4 consecutive (at-bat) homers, 9 walks, and

pick up both wins.

play and he receives a tremendous ovation from the Cincinnati fans.

National League franchise during the 1899 season.

As a result of the merger of Bank One and JP Morgan Chase & Co. the
Diamondbacks' home field, Bank One Ballpark, is renamed Chase Field. Arizona

comforted to know the team will continue to employ D. Baxter Bobcat as the
team's mascot.

2006
With one home game left on the schedule, the Dodgers break its single-season
attendance record established in 1982 as the team sells 3,708,723 tickets

determined by former National League rules which counted fans by turnstile
count.

In Milwaukee's Miller Park, the Brewers beat the Giants, 10-8. Barry Bonds
hits his 734th career HR to break Hank Aaron's NL record for homers in one
league. The historic long ball hit by the unpopular 42-year-old Giants
slugger receives little fanfare in the city in which 'Hammerin' Hank',
a former player for Braves and Brewers, is a local legend.

2007
The 41-year-old RFK Stadium, one-time home to the NFL Redskins and American
League Senators, hosts its last major league baseball game as Washington
beats the Phillies in the home finale, 5-3. When the District's new expansion

the Montreal Expos arrived in D.C. to become the Nationals in 2005.

Milton Bradley's anterior cruciate ligament is torn when his manager Bud
Black spins him to the ground to keep him from going after umpire Mike

appeared in 13 consecutive postseasons, spanning Derek Jeter's entire career.

Blanked for the 13th time this season, the Tigers lose to Kansas City, 5-0,
and fall into last place in the American League Central Division. Detroit,
after making significant moves in the off season, had been favored to be
one of the best teams in baseball.

to surpass Jason Schmidt, who had 251 K's in 2004.

Jose Reyes collects his 200th hit of the season with a bases-loaded triple in

history to reach the esteemed plateau.

2009
Trailing 8-0 at Dodgers Stadium, the Giants take the lead scoring nine runs

tallies four runs in the top of the tenth frame for the 14-10 victory.

After signing him to a one-year contract extension for 2010, the Braves

appearances and a world championship during his 24-year tenure in Atlanta.

2010
The lone run in the Blue Jays' 1-0 victory over Seattle at the Rogers
Centre scores in the first inning when Jose Bautista hits his 50th homerun
of the season, making the right-fielder the 26th player to reach the
coveted plateau. The milestone had not been accomplished since 2007 when
Prince Fielder and Alex Rodriguez hit 50 and 54 homeruns, respectively.
Ichiro Suzuki, with his fifth-inning single off Toronto's Shawn Hill, becomes
the first major leaguer to compile ten consecutive 200-hit seasons, breaking
the record he shared with Willie Keeler. The Mariner outfielder now has more

Pete Rose as the only other player with ten seasons with 200 or more hits.

2011
Starlin Castro becomes the youngest Cubs player to collect 200 hits in
a season when he singles off Chris Carpenter leading off the game in

two years younger than Billy Herman (1932) and Augie Galan (1935), who were
both 23 at the time.

The Brewers win their first division title in 29 years when they beat Florida,
4-1. Ryan Braun's three-run homerun in the eighth inning, breaking the 1-1
deadlock, is the decisive blow in the Miller Park clincher.

The Rangers' 5-3 victory over Seattle, coupled with a Halos loss, clinches
the AL West division. The title is the second in a row for Texas and the
fifth in the history of the franchise.

The Diamondbacks beat San Francisco, 3-1, to win the NL West division for
the first time in four years. Arizona, who finished 65-97 last season,

the delight of the cheering fans at Chase Field.

2013
With their 2-1 win over Chicago thanks to Starling Marte's ninth-inning homer,

postseason for the first time since 1992. The victory assures the Bucs one
of the two wildcard berths with a division title still within reach.

2014
Arizona names Dave Stewart as the team's fourth general manager in franchise
history. The former All-Star big league pitcher, a 20-game winner for four
consecutive seasons beginning in 1987, will report to the Diamondbacks'
chief baseball officer Tony La Russa, who was his manager when he posted
a 119-78 record (.604) during his eight seasons with the A's.
