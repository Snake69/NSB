1902
The White Sox' first no-hitter in franchise history is tossed by Jim 'Nixey'
Callahan when he defeats the Tigers, 2-0. The right-hander will accumulate
99 victories on the mound, but the utility player will only pitch in eight
of his 13 seasons in the major leagues.

OF-P James "Nixey" Callahan of the White Stockings pitches a no-hitter
against Detroit, winning 3-0.

1903
In front of a packed house of 25,000+, the Cubs miss taking over second
place from the Giants by losing to New York, 6-2. Jack Taylor loses to Joe
McGinnity, with umpire Emslie getting blamed for "frequent and inexcusable
blunders" (The Chicago Inter Ocean). Pittsburgh leads by 9 games.

A bad day for the Poughkeepsie Giants (Class D Hudson River League) as
they drop a quadruple header to Hudson by the scores of 2-1, 6-4, 3-1 and
4-2. This is the only quadrupleheader of the 20th century.

1905
Cleveland makes 7 errors in the 8th inning, a major-league record for an
inning, giving the White Sox 8 runs and a 9-6 victory.

Chicago President Charles Comiskey orders a houseboat built for the express
purpose of transporting and housing the team during spring training.

Boston Beaneater lefty Irv Young beats Brooklyn, 6-5, for his 20th win. He'll
lose his 20th in 10 days.

1906
The 2nd-place Giants split two in Pittsburgh, winning the opener, 10-4,
behind Joe McGinnity. In the 5-inning nitecap, called on account of darkness,
the Pirates reach Mathewson for 7 hits to win, 3-2.

1907
Every player but one is hitless in the Pittsburgh-Brooklyn game, won by
the Pirates, 2-1. Rookie Nick Maddox, making his 3rd appearance, allows no
Superba hits for the first Pittsburgh 9-inning no-hitter. Pirate manager Fred
Clarke gets the only two hits given up by Elmer Stricklett, but neither safety
figures in the scoring ... all three runs in the game are unearned. Earlier in
the year, Maddox hurled two no-hitters while at Wheeling (Central League). At
the age of 20 years ten months, the Pirate hurler becomes the second rookie
and remains the youngest pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the major leagues.

1908
In the bottom of the ninth inning at Huntington Avenue Grounds, Freddy Parent,
while being walked intentionally by Eddie Plank, reaches out and pokes a
shallow sac fly to right field. The unexpected sacrifice scores the winning
run in the White Sox' 1-0 victory over Philadelphia, and gives Frank Smith,
who held the A's hitless (with 1 walk), his second career no-hitter. 'Piano
Mover', as the right hander is called by his White Sox teammates, also held
the Tigers hitless for a game in 1905.

In St. Louis, Rube Waddell strikes out 17 Washington Senators in 10 innings
to beat Walter Johnson, 2-1.

1910
The Cards beat the Giants, 5-1, then lose the nitecap, 3-2. Rookie Ed Zmich,
still looking for his first win, loses to Mathewson. Matty allows 10 hits
but K's 10.

1911
Bill Bergen ends his major league career with the lowest lifetime batting
average for a position player in major league history by hitting an anemic
.170 during his 11-year tenure with the Reds and Superbas. The 33-year-old
backstop, who only had one year of batting above .200, also holds the
records for lowest season batting average for a regular (.139 in 1909)
and the longest streak of at-bats without a hit (46 in 1909).

1912
Joe Wood's bid for a 17th straight victory falls short as Detroit beats
Boston, 6-4, on 2 unearned runs. Wood gives up 7 hits and, in the 3rd,
walks 4 in a row. Detroit starter Bill Covington who is thrown out of the
game in the 5th inning with the Tigers ahead, 3-1, receives credit for the
victory. Joe Lake mops up the last 5 innings for Detroit.

1914
John Lush of Portland (PCL) pitches a 9-inning no-hitter against Venice,
losing 1-0. It is the 2nd no-hit loss in the PCL in 5 years (Frank Arellanes,
Sacramento, October 17, 1910, loses 2-0).

1915
In front of a full house at Fenway Park, including Vice-President Thomas
Marshall, Babe Ruth gives Boston a 3-2 win over Detroit. Rube Foster relieves
Babe with 2 outs in the 8th. Ruth is 1 for 3 at-bat.

After the A's win the opener, 5-4, over Cleveland, Bud Davis walks 12
Indians in game 2 and Cleveland wins, 5-3. Davis is the 2nd A's pitcher
in 2 weeks to walk that many. Clarence Garrett is the loser in the opener,
although helping himself with a wild pitch in the second inning. With Healy
at-bat with 2 outs and a 2-2 count, Garrett fires a pitch in the dirt that
bounces off the mask of C O'Neill and rebounds onto the diamond. Healy
swings and misses and hustles to 1B on the missed third strike. Lajoie,
who is on third, attempts to score and Garrett retrieves the rebound and
tags out Nap for the 3rd out.

1916
Al Demaree of the Phillies pitches both games of a doubleheader and wins
both against the Pirates. Demaree tosses a shutout to win the first game,
7-0, as the Phils knock Cooper out with a 7-run 6th inning, plating all the
runs with 2 outs. Demaree wins the second game, 3-2, when Al Mamaux throws
a wild pitch in the 9th with the bases loaded. Demaree's feat of winning
two complete games in a day will be matched in a week by teammate Alexander.

The New York Giants win their 15th in a row as Ferdie Schupp stops the
Cubs, 4-2.

1917
Baltimore (Federal League) files suit against the NL.

1919
On "Babe Ruth Day" at Fenway, 31,000 jam the park to see the Knights of
Columbus of South Boston honor one of their own members between games of
the DH with Chicago. Ruth starts on the mound in game 1, his first start
since September 1, and Allan Russell relieves in the 6th inning. With the
score tied 3-3 in the 9th, Babe, now playing LF, golfs an outside pitche
from Lefty Williams over the LF wall to win the game, 4-3. With the hit,
Ruth ties Ned Williamson's 1884 ML HR mark of 27. Boston takes the nitecap,
5-4, with Ruth scores the winning run in the 5th. He is deprived of a homer
when his 5th-inning drive bounces out of the bleachers and ump Billy Evans
rules it a double. Evans spots the fans scrambling for the ball and rules
it a ground-rule double under the day's temporary ground rules. A petition
signed by witnessing fans is brought to Evans by a National Guardsman
(filling in for the striking Boston police) but the ump dismisses it. This
will be the last game Ruth plays for the Red Sox in Fenway.

1920
Carl Mays stops the Yanks' 4 game loss streak with a 4-3 win over the
Browns. Ruth tallies the winning run in the 11th inning for NY, giving the
Babe an AL-record 148 runs scored. Cobb had 147 in 1911. Ruth doubled off
Carl Weilman in the 11th after striking out twice on slow curves.

In Cleveland, Duster Mails cancels the Red Sox, 8-3, for the Indians'
6th win in a row.

The A's lose to the White Sox, 13-6.

At New York, the Giants and Reds break even, with New York taking the 1st
game, 5-2, with 3 unearned runs. The Reds win game 2, 9-3, as Hod Eller
strikes out 8, including George Burns 3 times. Cincinnati 2B Maurice Rath,
who will hit only 2 HRs in 506 ABs, collects both of them in game 2 -
both are inside-the-park HRs - in the 7th and 8th innings.

1922
Brooklyn's Burleigh Grimes stops the Cardinals on 3 scratch hits to
win the opener, 6-1, of twinbill against St. Louis. Grimes also snaps
Rogers Hornsby's hit streak at 33 games, which still stand as a Cardinal
record. Hornsby recovers his stroke in the nightcap and hits 2 HRs as the
Cards outslug the Robins, 13-7.

1923
The Yanks clinch their 3rd straight pennant, beating St. Louis, 4-3, to
lead by 18 games. Their final margin is 16.

1924
Pete Alexander slows the pennant-bound Giants and earns his 300th career
victory in the process. The Cubs top the Giants in 12 innings at the Polo
Grounds, 7-3. Hartnett has 4 hits while Pete is 1 for 6 at the plate.
37-year-old 'Old Pete' will collect 373 victories during his 20-year career.

The Pirates nip Brooklyn, 5-4 in 11 innings, and stop Dazzy Vance's 15-game
winning streak. Pie Traynor hits a 2-out single in the 11th, and Maranville
follows with a liner to center. Eddie Brown's try for a shoestring catch
misses and Traynor scores.

Pitching on 2 days rest in St. Louis, Walter Johnson is pounded out of
the box by the Browns and pinch hit for in the 2nd. Each team collects 18
hits as the Browns prevail, 15-14. Goslin gives the Nats a 14-13 lead in
the 10th with his 2nd HR of the game, but a wild throw to 2nd by reliever
Firpo Marberry gives the win to the Browns.

Eager Beavers. Portland, scoring in every inning except the 1st, beats
visiting Salt Lake City, 18-8. Emmett McCann of Portland sets a PCL record
collecting seven hits, all singles, as Portland has 34 hits.

1925
In Cleveland, the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland old-timers play a 6-6 8-inning
tie. The lineups include Three Finger Brown, Jimmy Archer Artie Hofman,
Mort Scanlan and Dutch Meier for Chicago; for Cleveland, Larry Lajoie,
Dode Paskert, Chief Zimmer, Cy Berger, Cy Young and Joe Delahanty. The game
benefits the Amateur and Old-timer's Baseball Association of Cleveland:
"This association employs a doctor to look after the injuries of any boy
hurt in baseball in that district." Before boarding the train for Cleveland,
Brown throws batting practice for the Cubs at Chicago.

1926
With the Cardinals idle, the Reds' nosedive continues as the Braves sweep a
pair from Cincinnati, 4-3 and 3-0. In game 1, Edd Roush misses a shoestring
catch of a Andy High fly ball, which goes for an inside-the-park HR. Roush
also misses an easy fly ball in the 6th. Bob Smith applies the calcimine
in game 2, with Dolf Luque on the losing end.

1928
The White Sox beat New York, 4-3, and the Yankee lead is cut to one game.

A crowd of 50,000 at the Polo Grounds sees the Giants and Cardinals split
a doubleheader. The Cards take the first game, 8-5, behind pitcher Willie
Sherdel plus three homers by former Giant George Harper. The Giants salvage
the nightcap, 7-4, when they score 5 runs in the 8th inning to give rookie
Carl Hubbell the win over Grover Cleveland Alexander. Shanty Hogan's grand
slam off Alexander is the big blow. New York remains 2 games behind the
NL-leading Cardinals.

1929
Cleveland's Joe Sewell finally strikes out as Boston's Danny MacFaydan K's
him in the 6th of a 6-4 Indian victory. Sewell had not struck out since
the Browns' George Blaeholder whiffed him in the 3rd inning on May 20 -
a stretch of 115 games and 442 at-bats. The Sox leave 12 on base and are
stopped by reliever Wes Ferrell in the 8th.

Yanks manager Miller Huggins goes in the hospital with a high fever and
coach Artie Fletcher will take over in the interim.

1930
The Cubs' pennant hopes get dimmer as the Braves drop the Bruins, 3-2. Bob
Smith scatters 6 hits to win for Boston. Just acquired reliever Jesse Petty,
who is replaced by Blake in the 3rd frame after giving up three runs,
is the Cubs loser.

A sober Flint Rhem pitches the Cardinals to a 9-3 win over the Phillies in
the first of two at Philadelphia. The Cards break a 2-2 tie with a 7-run
outburst in the 7th. Gus Mancuso paces the winners with a pair of homers,
while Chuck Klein homers for the Quakers. The Phils take the nitecap, 4-3,
scoring the winning run on Friberg's rap with no outs in the 9th. Chuck
Klein hits his 57th double in the nitecap.

Joe Hauser of the Baltimore Orioles (International League) sets a new minor
league record by hitting his 63rd HR.

1931
The Yanks run their win streak to 10 in a row, beating the Indians, 7-1 and
10-4 in 7 innings. Lou Gehrig hits his 45th homer in game 1 and drives in
4 runs for the afternoon to break his old RBI mark of 175, set in 1927. By
the season's end he will have a total of 184. Ruth also drives home 4 runs
and hits his 44th in game 2.

Before a game with Brooklyn, Sparky Adams, Cards 3B, injures his ankle. He
can see only limited action in the WS, leaving a chance for Andy High
to shine as his substitute. Gabby Street, 48-year-old Cardinal manager,
catches the last 3 innings of the 6-1 win against the Robins. Street, who
last played in 1912, throws out Babe Herman, the only Brooklyn runner who
tries to steal. Street is 0 for 1 at the plate.

1932
The Chicago Cubs clinch the NL pennant when Kiki Cuyler hits a triple with
the bases loaded for a 5-2 win over Pittsburgh. Guy Bush wins his 19th game
and rookie Billy Herman tops the 200 mark in hits for the season. Tomorrow
the Cubs will snub ex-manager Rogers Hornsby on the split of WS shares.

At the Polo Grounds, Fred Fitzsimmons coasts to a 15-3 win over the
Braves. Boston catcher Johnny Schulte bangs a 9th-inning solo shot for the
final score, the homer coming in his last ML at-bat. The veteran caught on
with the Braves when Pinky Hargrave broke a leg in a game that Schulte was
watching at Sportsman's Park. Earlier in the year, he was watching at game
at the same park when Browns C Rick Ferrell broke a hand, and Schulte was
signed for the recovery period.

Babe Ruth returns to the Yankees lineup.

Hoping to boost attendance, the Sacramento Senators and Oakland Acorns
open their final Coast League series here by starting two Asian American
pitchers. For the Senators is Kenso Nushida, a Japanese-American, and Lee
Hun Hong, a Chinese-American goes for Oakland.

1933
Lefty Grove scores his 23rd victory as the A's down Detroit, 2-1. The
Mackmen garner just five hits off Carl Fischer.

The Senators clinch a tie for the pennant, routing the Browns with 7 runs
in the 3rd, and winning 13-5. Alvin Crowder wins his 24th.

The Yankees win, 5-3 over Chicago.

At Grand Central Station, a crowd of 5,000 to 10,000 fans are on hand to
greet the Giants on their return from the west.

1934
Pitching for Pittsburgh, Burleigh Grimes, the last of the 17 legal
spitballers, makes his final ML appearance, tossing one hitless inning and
striking out his last batter, Joe Stripp. Grimes relieves Waite Hoyt who
loses, 2-1, to Brooklyn's Leslie Munns.

1935
The Pittsburgh Crawfords beat the New York Cubans to win the Negro NL
Championship, 3-0, behind the pitching of Leroy Matlock and the extra-base
hits of Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell and Oscar Charleston.

1937
Carl Hubbell, in relief, wins his 20th game, beating the Cards, 10-3. The
Giants maintain a 2 1/2 game lead over Chicago. The first 6 batters for
each team hit safely against the 2 starters, Melton and Weiland.

The Cubs edge the Dodgers, 5-4, to keep the pressure on the Giants. Brooklyn's
Bert Haas hits a pinch double for the 3rd successive game.

Lefty Gomez pitches his 2nd successive shutout, beating Detroit, 5-0, for
his 20th win. Gehrig's 2-run single and DiMaggio's 2-run homer, his 44th,
are the big blows.

1940
At Detroit, the Tigers, down 4-1, jump on Bob Feller, in relief of Mel
Harder, and Joe Dobson for 5 runs, and win 6-5. For the first time in 18
games the Tigers fail to hit a homerun. The Tigers now lead the AL by a
game over the Tribe. The Plain Dealer's Gordon Cobbledick laments, "If the
Indians fail to win the pennant, it will be because Feller has been worn
to a frazzle by working in and out of turn."

1941
Leading 3-1 going into the 9th, the Cards give up 6 runs to the Cubs in the
9th to lose 7-3. In the 9th, reliever Howie Crist's first pitch to rookie
Bob Scheffing is hit for a grand slam.

The Dodgers sweep two from the Phils, winning 3-1 and 6-1. Whit Wyatt,
with Hugh Casey in relief, and Kirby Higbe are the winning pitchers, each
recording their 21st wins of the year.

Washington's Dutch Leonard wins a tight game, 1-0, over 30-year-old Roger
Wolff, making his ML debut for the A's. Dutch allows 4 hits while Wolff
allows 3.

Newsom loses his 19th.

1945

by the same score. Cleveland scores 6 runs in the 8th with the help of 4
errors to rout Benton.

1946
George Kell is 6 for 7 to pace the Tigers' 22-hit attack against
Cleveland. The Tigers roar, 15-1, with Fred Hutchinson getting the easy
win over Allie Reynolds, allowing just a run on Eddie Robinson's HR.

1949
Jackie Robinson steals home in a 5-0 Dodger win against the Cubs. It is
his 5th steal of home this year - the 2nd against the Cubs - and the 13th
in his 3 years in the NL. That is the most career home swipes in the ML
since Ben Chapman stole his 15th and last in 1940, his 11th season.

The Yankees edge the White Sox, 3-1, with Joe Page preserving the win for
Allie Reynolds (17-5).

The Red Sox rally to beat the Indians, 6-5, after Boston manager Joe McCarthy
complains that Indian pitcher Bob Lemon, who allows no hits in the first
5 innings, was fingering the peak of his cap between pitches. Ordered to
replace the sweat-stained hat, Lemon then loses his no-hitter when pitcher
Mel Parnell slaps a 6th inning single to ignite a 5-run Sox rally. Parnell
wins his 24th.

1950
Thrashing the Cubs, 9-6 at Philadelphia, the Phils open a 7 1/2 game lead,
their biggest so far. Jim Konstanty, appearing for the 68th time, wins his
16th, thanks to 2 homers by Mike Goliat. Boston and Brooklyn are tied for
2nd place with 79-61 records. The Phils are at 87-54.

The Red Sox' pennant hopes are jolted by the Indians who take a doubleheader
sweep, 6-3 and 7-1. The losses drop the Yawkeymen out of a 2nd place tie
with Detroit. Bob Lemon wins his 21st in the opener, and Early Wynn cops
his 17th in game 2. Easter and Gordon homer to give the Tribe a club-record
156. Billy Goodman, hitting .357, is 2 for 8 to go over 400 at-bats and
qualify for the hitting title. He is leading George Kell by 14 points.

1951
Following a day off in Cincinnati, Ken Raffensberger beats the Giants, 3-1,
with reliever Blackwell striking out Westrum and Hank Thompson in the 9th
with 2 runners on base. Jim Hearn is the loser.

Carl Erskine pitches the Dodgers to a 4-3 win over the Cardinals. Brooklyn's
magic number is reduced to 5.

Replacing "Happy" Chandler, the owners elect NL President Ford Frick as the
3rd commissioner of baseball for a 7-year term at $65,000 per annum. Warren
Giles withdraws on a vote deadlock to open the way for Frick, who has been
NL prexy since 1934. The former National League president, who will be best
remembered for his decision as commish for suggesting the single-season
homerun records of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris be listed separately based on
the length of the season, will hold the position for fourteen years.

1952
The Senators top the Red Sox, 10-6, and pin the loss on Mel Parnell, his
first defeat to the Nats since May 28, 1948. Parnell had won 17 straight
against Washington but the portsider does not survive the 4th inning. Shea
has 2 hits and 2 RBIs to help his win.

1953
Gene Baker, the other half of the Kansas City Monarchs double play duo
along with Ernie Banks, joins his former Negro League teammate making his
major league debut with the Cubs. In 1961, the second baseman will be named
manager of the minor league Batavia, New York team becoming the first black
manager in organized baseball.

Ernie Banks of the Cubs hits his first ML HR, against Gerry Staley, but
the Cards win, 11-6.

1954
The Giants clinch the pennant as Sal Maglie beats the Dodgers, 7-1, in the
opener of a series with the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. Mays has three hits
to take over the NL lead with a .344 average. The Giants now get ready
for the Indians, a team they beat 13 out of 21 times in spring training.
The Giants will go on to sweep Cleveland in the Fall Classic.

At Milwaukee, Warren Spahn of the Braves beats the Reds, 6-2, to notch his
20th win. Spahn has now won 20 games 6 times.

1955
Brooklyn sweeps a pair from the Phils, winning 6-3 and 6-1, over Murry Dickson
and Robin Roberts. In game 2, reserve 1B Frank Kellert's HR in the 4th is
the Dodgers' 200th of the season, making them the first team to hit 200 or
more in a season more than once. They did it with 208 in 1953. Robin Roberts
surrenders a 2nd homer, to George Shuba, making it 40 for the season for
Roberts, a ML record. The previous mark set in 1938, by game 1 loser Dickson.

Giants slugger Willie Mays poles 2 HRs against the Pirates, giving him
50 for the year, making him only the 7th player in history to accomplish
this. The Giants sweep the doubleheader, winning 11-1 and 14-8. Mays'
HR in the 2nd game is his 7th in 6 consecutive games.

In his first ML start, Red Sox rookie Frank Malzone is 6 for 10 in a
doubleheader loss against Baltimore. His 6 hits are consecutive. The O's win,
3-2 in 10 innings and 7-4, to stretch their win streak to 6 games.

The Scooter returns to action and bats 9th behind Don Larsen as the Yankees
sweep a pair from the Senators, 6-3 and 9-7. The Bombers now lead the
Indians by 2 1/2 games with 5 to play.

1956
Second year Orioles catcher Tommy Gastall, 24, is killed when the small
plane he is flying crashes into the Chesapeake Bay. The $40,000 bonus baby
had been a quarterback at Boston College and his premature death is eerily
similar to that of Harry Agganis, a quarterback at Boston University,
who died in his 2nd year with the Red Sox, in 1955.

Bob Friend holds the Braves to 4 hits and the Pirates edge the Braves,
2-1 in 10 innings.

1957
The Yankees top the Red Sox, 7-4, despite a pinch homer by Ted Williams in
the 9th inning, off Bob Grim. In his last at-bat, Williams hit an 8th-inning
solo shot on the 17th, both times pinch hitting for Murray Wall.

At Chicago, Warren Spahn and the Braves defeat the Cubs, 9-3. Spahn wins
his 20th, and will lead the NL in winning percentage with .667.

1958
Orioles P Hoyt Wilhelm, in a rare start (he is 0-6 this year when starting),
pitches a 1-0 no-hitter, the first in O's history, against Don Larsen
of the Yankees, fanning 8. Larsen allows one hit through 6 innings. The
Orioles acquired Wilhelm in August for the $20,000 waiver price. The win,
Wilhelm's first ML complete game, and his only one this year for the O's,
improves his record to 3-10. The winning margin is Gus Triandos' 30th HR,
off reliever Bobby Shantz. This will be the last time in this century the
Yankees fail to get a hit in a game.

The Giants' Ruben Gomez gives up 3 hits, all to Bobby Gene Smith, as the
Giants beat St. Louis, 5-1. Willie Mays' 3 hits raises his average to .340,
and he steals his 30th base, the first to steal 30 three times since Kiki
Cuyler in 1930.

1959
Losing to the Dodgers, 8-2, the San Francisco Giants play their last game
at Seals Stadium. The transplanted New York team, which compiled an 86-68
in their two-year stay in the former PCL park, will move to the newly
constructed Candlestick Park next season. The Dodgers sweep this series and
drop the Giants from first to 3rd. The Braves are in 2nd, a half-game back.

1960
Boston OF Carroll Hardy pinch-hits for Ted Williams, who is forced to leave
the game after fouling a ball off his ankle and grounds into a DP. It is
the only time Williams has been pinch hit for. On May 31, 1961, Hardy will
pinch hit for rookie Carl Yastrzemski, making him the only player to go to
bat for both future Hall of Famers. Hardy also pinch hit for Maris when
both were at Cleveland. The Orioles win today, 5-4, when Brooks Robinson
pulls away from a pitch and accidentally bloops an RBI single in the 8th.

In Milwaukee, Jay Hook gives up just 2 hits as the Reds win, 8-0, and chill
the Braves' pennant hopes.

First place Pittsburgh sweeps a pair from the Phillies, winning 7-1 and
3-2. The Bucs lead by 6 games. Bob Friend wins the opener and sets a new
club record for strikeouts, beating Hendrix' mark of 176 set in 1912.

1961
In a 13-inning contest, Sandy Koufax goes the distance beating the Cubs, 3-2,
in the last regular season game to be played at the LA Memorial Coliseum,
which was originally built for the 1932 Olympics. The Dodgers are leaving
the only home they have known since moving from Brooklyn four seasons ago
to play in a brand new stadium in Chavez Ravine, located a few miles from
downtown Los Angeles.

The Yankees' 154th game of 1961 (including a tie) is Roger Maris' last chance
to beat the Babe, in compliance with Commissioner Ford Frick's statement
that, for the record to be broken, Maris must do it in the same number of
games as Ruth. Maris' 59th HR of the year, off Milt Pappas, is short of the
record, but helps New York beat Baltimore, 4-2, clinching its 26th AL pennant
(second straight and 11th in 13 years). In 1998, Pappas will state that he
told Maris the night before that, if the game's outcome is not on the line,
he would throw him nothing but fastballs. Yogi Berra also homers today. The
Yankees will finish with a 109-53 record, tying the 1969 Orioles for the
best won-loss record of the decade.

1963
The Yankees edge the Athletics, 5-4 in 13 innings. Rookie 2B Pedro Gonzalez
helps the win by pulling the hidden ball trick in the 11th frame and tagging
out A's OF Ken Harrelson, who had advanced to 2B after a single and a sac
bunt. As noted by Bill Deane, Gonzalez plays only 7 games in the field
this year.

1964
Jim Bunning, in relief, strikes out Johnny Roseboro in the 9th to preserve
the Phils' 3-2 win in Los Angeles. The win comes after 2 straight losses
and leaves the 1st place Phils in front of the NL by 6 1/2 games with 12 to
play. When they return to Philley in the early morning, 2,000 fans including
Mayor James Tate are on hand to greet the team.

1965
Just 812 see the soon-to-be Atlanta Braves lose to the Phils, 4-1, in
Milwaukee. This contest is a makeup game.

Fewer fans (537) see the A's Jim "Catfish" Hunter beat Jim "Mudcat" Grant,
8-2, in Minnesota. This contest is a makeup game.

In Cleveland's 5-4 win, Pedro Gonzalez of the Indians swings a bat at P
Larry Sherry of the Tigers following a Sherry brushback pitch. Gonzalez is
fined $500 by AL President Joe Cronin the following day.

1966
The Mets' 3-0 victory over Houston, their 63rd win, assures the team will lose
less than a hundred games in a season for the first time in the five-year
history of the franchise. The Amazin's, who will finish the campaign in
ninth place with a 66-95 record, averaged 113 losses a season during their
first four years in the league.

Orioles P Tom Phoebus hurls his 2nd straight shutout in his 2nd ML game,
blanking the A's, 4-0, in Kansas City. Karl Spooner was the last rookie to
start with 2 shutouts.

Vern Law shuts out the Giants, 6-0, to keep the Pirates 1 1/2 games behind
the Dodgers. Pittsburgh turns 4 double plays in the game and will end the
year with an NL-record 215.

1967
Steve Carlton of the Cardinals strikes out 16 batters, including 7 in a row,
in 8 innings but still loses, 3-1, to Chris Short and the Phillies.

The Red Sox, down 2-0 in Cleveland, rally on Yaz' 41st HR and a 3-run HR by
Rico Petrocelli to win 5-4. Yaz, with 4 hits in the game, is now leading the
AL with a .316 average, and is 1st in RBIs and HRs. The Twins, Tigers and
White Sox all keep pace. The Twins win 6-2 as Dean Chance K's 13 for his 18th
victory. Detroit routs the Yankees, 10-1, while Chicago tops the Angels, 6-4.

In the Reds' 9-4 win over the Braves, Johnny Bench hits his first ML homer,
a 3-run shot off Jim Britton in Atlanta.

1968
At Yankee Stadium, Boston's Jim Lonborg tosses just his 3rd complete game
of the year to beat New York, 4-3. Yastrzemski has three hits, including
a homer, to raise his average to .306. Mantle hits homer number 536, the
last of his career, for New York.

1969
Giving the Pirates their third win in two days against the eventual world
champs, Bob Moose no-hits the first-place Mets at Shea Stadium, 4-0. The
21-year-old Pirates right-hander will compile a 14-3 record with 2.91 ERA
for the third-place Bucs this season. It is the NL's record 5th no-hitter
of the season. The Mets will win their next 9 games.

1970
Jim Palmer wins his 20th game, defeating the Indians, 7-0. The Orioles are
the first club since 1956 to have three 20-game winners.

Bill Melton sets a White Sox club record with his 30th HR (Eddie Robinson
had the mark with 29) leading Chicago to an 8-4 win over the Royals in game
1. Kansas City's Jim York makes his ML debut in the nitecap, pitching 4
2/3 innings of relief in winning his first game, 8-2. Paid attendance at
Comiskey is 672.

1971
The Senators beat the Indians, 8-6 in 20 innings, thus completing a suspended
game begun 6 days earlier in Cleveland. The two teams finish the 20 frames
with 30 walks issued, an AL record for an extra-inning game. Washington
pitchers hand out 19 walks. The two teams combine on another AL record as
they strand 25 base runners, and the teams combine for record 4 runs in the
20th inning. In the nitecap, the Indians win, 3-1, handing Denny McLain
his 21st defeat. Meanwhile, Senators owner Bob Short is given permission
to move his team to Texas, where they will become the Rangers, a nickname
adopted on November 23rd.

1972
By scoring all of their runs in the second inning, the Braves put it on
cruise control beating the Astros, 13-6. Only 2061 fans are on hand at
Atlanta Stadium to enjoy the big inning. Dusty Baker has 3 at-bats in the
inning, doubling to lead off, hitting a 3-run HR, then grounding out to
end the inning with the bases full.

With a 6-2 complete-game victory over Montreal at Wrigley Field, Milt Pappas
wins his 200th major league game. The Cubs' right-hander becomes the first
hurler to reach the milestone without the benefit of a single 20-win season.

At Anaheim, Royals pitcher Steve Busby loses a grand slam when 1B ump John
Rice signals that he had called time before the gopher pitch. John Mayberry
had already hit a grand slam in the inning. Busby (2-0) wins, 9-2, pitching
his second complete game following his debut win on September 8.

Sadaharu Oh of the Yomiuri Giants hits a HR to set a new Japanese record
of 7 HRs in 7 consecutive games. Dale Long in 1956 hit in 8 straight,
and several players have hit in 6.

1973
At Shea Stadium, Dave Augustine of the Pirates appears to hit a potential
game-ending homerun in the 13th inning but the ball hits the top of the
fence and Met outfielder Cleon Jones catches it and throws out Richie Zisk
at home plate (relayed by Wayne Garrett). The Mets go to win the game,
and the minor league veteran outfielder will never homer in the majors. The
Pirates lead over the Mets is cut to one-half game. Prior to the 4-3 Mets
victory, Willie Mays announces his retirement at a press conference held
at the ballpark's Diamond Club. Five days later, the club will honor the
aging superstar with a night at Shea Stadium.

A's speedster Bill North trips over 1B in a 5-4 loss to the Twins, severely
spraining his right ankle and costing him both the AL SB crown and a chance
to play in the WS. The Twins are 14-4 against Oakland this year, tying the
AL record of the 1909 A's for most wins against a pennant winner.

1974
The Cards beat the Cubs, 5-2, to stay ahead of the rampaging Pirates, winners
over the Mets. Rick Monday hits a leadoff HR for the Cubs, off Bob Forsch,
but it is all downhill after that. Ted Simmons has a double and a 3-run HR
off Bill Bonham to give him his 20th loss of the year.

Nolan Ryan allows just 3 hits but absorbs his 20th loss of the season as the
Twins beat the Angels, 3-2. Ryan walks 7. Joe Decker (16-12) is the winner.

The Yankees move into a tie with Baltimore in the AL East with a sweep of
the Indians. The Yanks take the opener, 5-4, when Bobby Murcer's 3rd hit,
a triple, scores the winning run in the bottom of the 9th. Gaylord Perry
takes his 20th loss. Larry Gura (5-0) wins the nitecap, 3-0, on 6 hits.

1975
The A's and Royals set an AL record by using 42 players in a 9-inning
game. Oakland wins, 16-4, with a AL record-tying 13 different players
scoring. The Yankees were the last to do it, in 1949. Rookie Jamie Quirk
belts his first ML homer, a pinch homer off Rollie Fingers. Quirk's next
pinch HR will come in 1990, an interim of 5,486 days ... this breaks a
mark set by Hank Sauer, who hit pinch homers in 1942 and again in 1956,
a spread of 5,193 days.

The Reds coast to a 9-2 win over the Braves as Darell Evans helps with 4
errors. The third sacker has now made 35 errors. Dave Brain, who made 5 errors
at 3B in a June 1906 game for the club record, made 48 errors that year.

1976
The Angels' Nolan Ryan outduels the Rangers' Bert Blyleven, 1-0.

1977

the Giants.

In San Diego, Tom Seaver pitches a 2 hitter as the Reds win, 4-0.

1978
The Red Sox collect 6 hits - 4 by Jerry Remy - off Dave Rozema but the Tigers
clobber Boston, 12-2. Lou Whitaker and Rusty Staub both have 3-run homers
to lead Detroit's 15-hit attack. The Sox loss, combined with the Yankees
split with Toronto, leaves New York two games in front with 10 games to go.

The Yanks split a pair with Toronto, with Ron Guidry losing his 3rd game
of the year. Lefty Mike Willis wins the duel with Guidry, 8-1.

1980
In memory of Thurman Munson, a bronze plaque is dedicated to the deceased
New York catcher in Yankee Stadium's Memorial Park. The 32-year-old team
captain Munson was killed last season attempting to land his Cessna Citation
at Akron-Canton Airport.

Baltimore hurler Steve Stone ties a club record for the most wins in a season
as he beats the Blue Jays for his 24th victory. The Orioles' right-hander
matches the 1970 totals of both Mike Cuellar and Dave McNally.

George Brett goes 0 for 4 in a 9-0 loss to the A's dropping his average
below .400 for good. He is now hitting .396 and will finish the season at
.390, the closest any player has come to a .400 batting average since Ted
Williams in 1941. Only Tony Gwynn will come closer than that before the
twentieth century ends.

California's Tony Armas does it all hitting 2 doubles and 2 HRs to drive
in 5 RBIs in a 6-4 win over Texas. Armas also has an intentional walk,
and steals 3rd.

The Minnesota Twins' game with the Chicago White Sox at Metropolitan
Stadium is postponed due to rain. The game is the last outdoor MLB game
to be postponed in the state for almost three decades as the Twins move to
the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in 1982 and ultimately to Target Field in
2010, where their scheduled game with the Baltimore Orioles on May 7 will
be rained out.

1981
Twins rookie Gary Gaetti homers in his first ML at-bat, off Charlie Hough
(2-1) but Texas beats the Twins, 4-3.

1983
In the first inning of a 14-1 rain-shortened five-inning victory over the
Orioles, the Tigers stroke 10 consecutive hits and score 11 runs. Detroit's
opening offense ties the American League record for runs scored to start
a game which was established by the Boston Americans (Red Sox) in 1901.

The Tigers rap 10 consecutive hits on the way to an 11-run first inning
against Baltimore, tying the AL record set by Boston in 1901. Detroit wins,
14-1, in a rain-shortened 5-inning game.

1984
At Jack Murphy Stadium, the Padres clinch their first NL West title since
entering the league in 1969 with a 5-4 win over the Giants. The key blow
is winning pitcher Tim Lollar's 3-run homerun, his 3rd homerun of the season.

The first-place Cubs break 2 million in home attendance for the first time
as 33,651 watch them lose to Pittsburgh, 7-6.

The Orioles roll over the visiting Red Sox, 15-1. Ken Singleton paces the
Birds with a grand slam, off Al Nipper, for his 246th and last career HR. His
previous two homers were also grand slams, the last coming on September 1st.

1985
A federal jury in Pittsburgh convicts Curtis Strong of 11 counts of cocaine
distribution after a trial whose prosecution witnesses revealed how widely
the drug problem afflicts major league baseball. Prominent players who were
granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony include Dave
Parker, Lonnie Smith, Keith Hernandez, Jeffrey Leonard and Tim Raines.

1986
Tying the National League record for steals in one game, Padres outfielder
Tony Gwynn swipes five bases as the Astros beat San Diego, 10-6. During
his 20-year career, the .338 lifetime hitter, will only average 16 stolen
bases per season.

Texas rookie Kevin Brown, the Rangers top pick in the June draft, registers
his first professional win, beating the Oakland A's, 9-5. Earlier in the
year, teammate Bobby Witt also won his first pro game in the majors. The
first Ranger to do it was David Clyde in 1973.

1988
Wade Boggs goes 3 for 3 with 2 walks in Boston's 13-2 rout of Toronto to
become the first player this century to collect 200 hits in 6 consecutive
seasons. Willie Keeler had 8 straight 200-hit seasons from 1894-1901. Boggs
also joins Lou Gehrig as the only players to collect 200 hits and 100 walks
in 3 consecutive seasons. The 30-year-old Red Sox third baseman will extend
the 200-hit streak to seven straight seasons with 205 hits in 1989.

The A's knock Frank Viola (22-7) out of the box in the 4th inning enroute
to a 12-3 win over Minnesota. In the 5-run 8th inning Mike Gallego makes
all 3 outs, grounding out and grounding into a DP. Davis (16-5) is the winner.

Darrell Evans hits his 400th career homerun off John Farrell in the 5th
inning, and Chet Lemon hits his 200th career homerun off Scott Bailes in
the bottom of the 9th to lead Detroit to a 3-1 win over Cleveland.

1989
At Wrigley, the Phils edge the Cubs, 9-8, with 18 hits, including 15
singles. The Cubs use 20 players, including 6 pitchers.

1992
Phillies 2B Mickey Morandini becomes the 9th player in history to turn
an unassisted triple play in Philadelphia's 13 inning 3-2 loss to the
Pirates. With runners on 1st and 2nd in the 6th inning, Morandini catches
Jeff King's line drive, steps on 2nd to double up Andy Van Slyke, and tags
out Barry Bonds, who is running from 1st.

The Cubs' Shawn Boskie gives up 6 hits and 6 runs in the 1st and departs
with no outs. He also loses as the Cards coast to a 16-4 win. St. Louis 3B
Stan Royer has 4 hits, 4 runs and 4 RBIs.

1993
Giants P Jim Deshaies goes 0 for 2 in a 7-2 win over the Astros. In doing
so, he sets a major league record by going 372 career at-bats without having
an extra-base hit. The old mark had been set by Virgil Barnes.

1995
The Rockies equal a franchise record for runs scored as they rout the Padres
on 23 hits, 20-1. Colorado outfielder Matt Holliday also ties a club mark
with 8 RBIs, homering twice in the Coors Field contest.

Maybe it shoulda rained. The Padres play their 1,000th straight home
game without a rainout, a streak going back to 1983, but the Rockies win,
10-2. Bill Swift (8-2) is the winner. Vinnie Castilla hits his 32nd HR and
Walt Weiss his 1st of the year and scores 5 runs. The streak, which began
on April 20, 1983, will end on May 12, 1998, a total of 1,184 games over
a span 15 years.

1996
Eddie Murray's 500th homerun ball is sold to Michael Lasky for $280,000 and
it could be worth as much as $500,000 thanks to an annuity to be paid over
20 years. The new owner, who is the founder of the Psychic Friends Network,
plans to put the Camden Yards souvenir on public display for "the people
of Baltimore".

Frank Thomas hits his 39th HR of the year, a grand slam, to power the White
Sox to a 7-3 win over the Twins. Dave Martinez hits a solo shot in his only
at-bat. Kevin Tapani gives up a 2-run HR to Rich Becker but emerges the
winner. Paul Molitor has a double to extend his consecutive game hitting
streak against the White Sox to 32 games (as noted by Retrosheet) over
three years.

1997
Cardinal Mark McGwire becomes the first major leaguer to hit 20 homeruns
for two different teams in the same season. 'Big Mac' had hit 34 with the
A's before being traded to St. Louis.

1998
At Milwaukee's County Stadium, Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire extends
his homerun record to 65 and should have had his 66th homer of the season,
but his fly ball to center field is ruled a ground rule double due to fan
interference which video replays clearly show as the wrong call. Big Mac's
first inning round-tripper, his 32th hit as a visiting player, breaks George
Foster's 1977 National League and ties 1927 Babe Ruth's records for homeruns
hit on the road. The Cardinals win, 11-6, over Milwaukee.

Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr takes himself out of the Orioles lineup prior
to the game with the Yankees to end his major league record consecutive
game streak at 2,632 (nearly 16 years). The Orioles lose the nationally
televised Sunday night historic game by a score of 5-4. Ryan Minor, Ripken's
replacement at 3B, gets 1 hit in 4 at-bats.

The Rockies' Darryl Kile pitches 10 shutout innings before he is lifted for
PH Larry Walker, who doubles off Randy Myers and comes around to score the
lone run in a 1-0 win over the Padres. Dave Veres earns the save.

Trent Hubbard hits a first-inning solo homerun for the Dodgers' only score
in a 1-0 win over Shawn Estes and the Giants. Carlos Perez pitches the
CG shutout. The Giants waste a leadoff triple in the 8th by catcher Brian
Johnson; his counterpart Charles Johnson is hitless.

1999
The Angels defeat the Devil Rays, 10-5, in a game marked by a confrontation
between umpire John Shulock and TB C Mike DiFelice in the 3rd inning. Shulock
was on his way out to the mound after being hit with a pitch from Devil Rays
P Wilson Alvarez when he was intercepted by DiFelice. AL president Gene Budig
will suspend Shulock for 3 games and fine him an undisclosed amount for his
"overly aggressive behavior, display of temper, inappropriate remarks and
physical contact."

2000
The Cardinals shoot down the Astros, 11-6, to clinch the NL Central and
become the 1st team to earn a playoff spot. Jim Edmonds hits a grand slam
for St. Louis and is followed by Ray Lankford's HR. It is the 15th time
this year that the Cards have homered in consecutive at-bats, tying the NL
mark set by Cincinnati in 1956.

The Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks, 1-0, when Eric Karros hits a game-ending
homer in the 9th off Byung-Hyun Kim. Karros is the only batter Kim faces.

San Diego's Adam Eaton is staked to a 15-4 lead, and the Padres hang on for
a 15-11 win over the Rockies. Dave Magadan and Mike Darr each have 4 RBIs,
while the Rock's Pen Petrick knocks in 4 runs without a hit, likely a ML
record. Petrick has a sac fly, bases loaded walk and 2 ground outs.

2001
Joe Mays of the Twins shuts out the Tigers, 3-0, on 6 hits. Mays is the
first pitcher since the Angels' George Brunet in 1966 to beat the Tigers
5 times in a season.

2002
With a 9-3 victory over the Astros at Busch Stadium, the Cardinals clinch the
Central Division of the National League. An emotional on-field celebration
includes Albert Pujols carrying Darryl Kile's No. 57 jersey onto the field
in tribute of the pitcher who died unexpectedly in June.

Baltimore's Mike Bordick sets a ML record with his 102nd consecutive
errorless game at SS as the Orioles drop a 4-2 decision to the Red Sox. He
also extends his ML mark of errorless chances at SS to 504. Rey Ordonez,
playing shortstop for the Mets, had established the mark in 1999-2000.

2003
Unlike this season when the team played twenty-five percent of its
home games in San Juan, the players vote to play their entire 2004 home
schedule in Montreal. The MLB owners, who collectively own the franchise,
have been considering moving the Expos permanently to Washington D.C.,
Portland (Oregon) or Monterrey (Mexico), or continuing the present format
by having the team split home games between different locations (Puerto
Rico or Mexico and Montreal).

When Marcus Giles sends Brad Penny's 3-2 pitch into the stands, the Braves tie
the National League record by having six players hit at least 20 homeruns in
season. Along with the Atlanta's second baseman, Javy Lopez, Gary Sheffield,
Andruw Jones, Chipper Jones and Vinny Castilla equal the mark established
by Eddie Mathews (32), Hank Aaron (32), Joe Torre (27), Felipe Alou (23),
Mack Jones (31) and Gene Oliver (21) of the 1965 Milwaukee Braves.

2006
Although the team bows to the Blue Jays at the Stadium, 3-2, the Yankees
capture their ninth consecutive AL East title thirty minutes later as the
second place Red Sox are defeated by the Twins. The Bronx Bombers become
the second team in the Big Apple this week to pop the champagne as their
crosstown rivals, the Mets, clinched the NL East Division two days ago.

After a Royals' 3-0 loss to the Angels, KC skipper Buddy Bell announces
he needs to take a medical leave to treat a growth in his tonsils and will
be replaced in the dugout by bench coach Billy Doran. The manager's wife,
Gloria, has also battled tonsil cancer.

2007
With his 4 for 4 performance and getting hit with a pitch with the bases
loaded, September call-up J.R. Towles establishes a franchise-record eight
RBIs as the Astros rout the Cardinals, 18-3. The outstanding offensive
output by the 23-year-old catcher, who started the season at Single-A Salem,
helps Houston produce its most lopsided victory in team history.

2008
With a 5-4 victory over St. Louis at Wrigley Field, the Cubs win their
second straight National League Central Division championship. It is the
first time the club will appear in consecutive postseasons since the 1906-08
teams played in the World Series.

2009
The Cubs suspend Milton Bradley for the rest of the year, a day after the
turbulent outfielder criticizes the team in a newspaper interview citing there
wasn't a "positive environment" in the organization, and he could see why
the club hasn't won a championship in the last century. The decision whether
Chicago brings back the 32-year-old, who still has two years remaining on
a $30 million three-year contract he signed as a free agent last offseason,
will be general manager Jim Hendry's call, according to manager Lou Piniella.

2010
A teen-age fan, wearing a red spandex suit with a red mask, is subdued
by Matt Diaz after the intruder runs onto the field and eludes security
guards during the Braves-Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park. The Braves'
left fielder tackles the costumed 17-year-old, who will be released from
juvenile detention tomorrow afternoon with the parents apologizing for
their son's actions.

George Steinbrenner is honored with a 7-by-5-foot 760-pound monument of
bronze atop a granite base in Monument Park. The unvieling of the tribute to
the recently deceased Yankee owner is attended by estranged former manager
Joe Torre, who is making his first visit to the new Yankee Stadium.

2011
Clayton Kershaw becomes the Dodgers' first 20-game winner since Ramon
Martinez accomplished the feat in 1990. Allowing just one run in 7 1/3
innings, the southpaw gets the victory when LA beats the visiting Giants, 2-1.

2012
Washington secures a playoff spot when they beat the Dodgers at Nationals
Park, 4-1. The last time there was postseason baseball in the nation's
capital occurred 79 years ago, when player-skipper Joe Cronin and the
Senators lost to the Giants in five games in the 1933 World Series.

2014
Oliver Perez records the first four-strikeout inning in Diamondback
history when a dropped third strike allows the first batter to reach base
in the seventh frame of the team's 5-1 loss to Colorado at Coors Field. The
33-year-old Arizona southpaw becomes the 69th different major league hurler
to accomplish the feat.

2018
Francisco Arcia of the Angels, against the Oakland Athletics, became the
first player in Major League history to catch, pitch and hit a homerun in
the same game.
