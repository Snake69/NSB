1901
The visiting New York Giants drop a pair to the Cards, as McGraw uses
position players on the mound. Heinie Smith, primarily a second baseman,
makes his only career start in game one and completes a 12-4 loss to the
Redbirds. He bats 7th and hits a HR. Jim "Sheriff" Jones also makes his
only career start in the second match and loses, 6-5, in a game called in
the 6th inning because of darkness. Jones bats 2nd in game 1 and plays RF,
and bats leadoff in game 2 going 0 for 4 in each.

1903
The seasonal contracts for Boston players expire and owner Killilea offers a
two-week extension to cover the World Series. This offer is later increased
to head off a players' strike.

1904
Doc White, White Sox lefthander, pitches his 5th shutout in 18 days,
defeating New York, 4-0. Of his 7 shutouts for the year, 6 come in September.

1905
The Athletics lose today, 4-3, but take 2 of 3 from Chicago at home to
all but end the White Sox' pennant hopes. The final margin is 2 games. The
series draws 64,620, a ML record, with thousands more turned away each day.

Mike Lynch of Pittsburgh beats Boston, 10-9, handing Irv Young his 20th
loss. Young (20-21), Willis (11-29), Fraser (14-21) and Wilhelm (4-23)
set a ML record as the first 4 pitchers on one team to all lose 20 games
in a season. A Beaneater quartet will match it next season.

1906
Boston American pitcher Floyd Kroh shuts out the Browns, 2-0, in his first
ML start.

1907
An overflow crowd lines the OF at Philadelphia's Columbia Park for the
showdown Monday doubleheader between the A's and Tigers. In the first game,
the home team gets off to a 7-1 lead against 25-game winner Bill Donovan. But
Rube Waddell, who relieves in the 2nd, fails to hold the lead. A 2-run HR
by Ty Cobb ties it 8-8 in the 9th. Both teams score once in the 11th; an
umpire's ruling costs Philadelphia the game in the 14th ... Harry Davis hits
a long fly into the crowd in left CF, ordinarily a ground-rule double. As
Tiger CF Sam Crawford goes to the crowd's edge, a policeman stands up and
moves, either to interfere or to get out of the way. Home plate umpire Silk
O'Loughlin says there is no interference, then reverses his ruling when
base umpire Tom Connolly offers a different opinion. When play resumes,
the Athletics' Danny Murphy hits a long single that would have scored
Davis. The game is called because of darkness in the 17th, a 9-9 tie. The
2nd game is never played. The Tigers, in first place, leave for Washington
where they will win 4. They will finish 1 1/2 games in front.

Cardinals 1B Ed Konetchy steals home twice in St. Louis' 5-1 win against
Boston. St. Louis sets a ML record with 3 steals of home in the game as
Joe Delahanty also scores in the 8th.

Behind Ed Reulbach, Chicago shuts out the Giants, 6-0. It is Chicago's
32nd shutout win of the year, tying the ML mark set by the White Sox last
year. The Cubs will match it again in 1909.

1908
The Pirates top the Cards at home, 7-5, as Sam Leever wins in relief of
Vic Willis. The win puts the Pirates all alone in 2nd place, .004 points
behind the Giants.

1909
At Pittsburgh, the Giants and Pirates split a twinbill ... New York takes
the opener, 6-2, then loses, 9-1. In the game-2 laugher, 49-year-old coach
Arlie Latham makes his last ML appearance, and his 4th this year. Latham
first played ML ball in 1880, for Buffalo.

1910
Browns 3B Ray Jansen gets 4 hits in 5 at-bats in his ML debut, the only
game he will play in the Majors. Speeding his exit are his 3 errors at
the hot corner. The last-place Browns fall to the White Sox, 9-1.

In a shootout at the Polo Grounds, Beals Becker hits a pinch grand slam
inside-the-park as the Giants outslug Brooklyn, 17-8. It is the 2nd
pinch slam IPHR in ML history; Mike O'Neill hit the first.

1911
At the West Side Grounds, Red Ames gives the Giants a needed 3-1 victory
over the 2nd-place Cubs.

In a field day at Chicago's White Sox park, Ed Walsh hits a fungo 419
feet and one-half inch, beating a 413-foot eight and one-half inch drive
by Cincinnati's Mike Mitchell on September 11, 1907. Harry Hooper of
the Red Sox wins the accuracy in throwing contest beating Jimmy Archer
of the Cubs and Jack Coombs of the A's. The planned three-inning game
is called on account of rain.

1912
The Giants foil Pete Alexander's bid for a 20th victory, beating the
Phils, 4-2. King Bader, making his first start, is the winner. After
winning 28 last year, Alex will be just 19-17 this season.

1913
Washington shuts out the A's again, winning 3-0, as 17-year-old
outfielder Merito Acosta collects two hits and swipes 3B in the 4th
inning. Yesterday, the Cuban teenager was caught trying in his steal
attempt.

The Phillies are 2-1 for the day, finishing the game of August 30th with
the Giants, and splitting two more. The Phils win, 8-6, with the loss
going to Mathewson, in the disputed game. Mathewson and Marquard then
combine to beat the Phils, 8-3, before the Quakers return the favor, 4-3.

1914
The Dodgers stop Alexander's win streak at 9 games, defeating the Phils,
2-1, behind Jake Pfeffer. Alex is done in by 3 Phillie errors.

In front of a handful of fans, the pennant-winning Braves top the Giants,
7-1, in the first of two. Boston then beats up Mathewson for 6 runs in 3
innings, but the game ends in a 7-7 tie. For the 2nd year in a row Matty
(24-13) will finish with more victories than walks (23).

1915
The Red Sox clinch the AL pennant as St. Louis beats Detroit, giving Boston a
2 1/2 game margin. The World Series is now set for another Boston-Philadelphia
matchup, but with the leagues reversed.

1916
In the opener of a doubleheader, Giants pitcher Rube Benton takes a no hitter
into the 8th inning before Braves 1B Ed Konetchy repeats his performance of 2
days ago by lacing a hit, the only Boston safety. Benton wins the one-hitter,
4-0, for New York's ML record 26th win in a row. Boston then wins the 2nd
game, 8-3, behind Lefty Tyler to snap the historic streak. Jeff Tesreau,
in relief of Slim Sallee, is ineffective. Despite the winning streak, and
an earlier skein of 17 victories on the road, New York finishes in 4th place.

Red Sox CF Tilly Walker, imitating Tris Speaker, his predecessor, dashes
in for a low line drive and beats the runner back to 2B for an unassisted
DP. It is an important play, as Dutch Leonard defeats Nick Cullop of the
Yankees, 1-0, in the 10th on Harry Hooper's sacrifice fly. The win clinches
a tie for the pennant for Boston. Cleveland will beat Chicago tomorrow to
give the flag to Boston.

Behind Eppa Rixey, the Phils take the morning game with Brooklyn, 7-2, and
now lead the NL by a half-game. Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 6-1, behind Rube
Marquard and they hammer Alexander for 11 hits including a homer by Casey
Stengel. The Phils also lose SS Dave Bancroft when he breaks his ankle running
to 1B. Bancroft had injured the leg earlier in the game while fielding a ball.

1917
Detroit's future Hall of Fame OF Sam Crawford retires from ML baseball at
37. In addition to his career-record 312 three-base hits, he has hit 50
inside-the-park HRs. He will play in the PCL for several years.

Jim Bagby scatters 11 hits to give the Indians a 2-1 win over the Senators as
Cleveland completes it's schedule. Cleveland's leadoff man, OF Jack Graney,
walks once to lead the AL with 94 walks despite a .241 BA. No other player
will lead a league in walks with so low a batting average until Gene Tenace
with Oakland in 1974 draws 110 walks with a .211 BA. In 1919 Graney will
walk 105 times and bat .234.

The Cubs finish the season with a 9-2 loss to the visiting Braves. Vic Saier,
out with a broken leg he suffered April 15th (as noted by Bill Deane),
starts at 1B and goes 3 for 4 in his last game as a Cub. He'll play in 1919
with the Pirates.

1921
It is Rogers Hornsby Day at Sportsman's Park, and the Cardinal star
celebrates by pounding out a HR and two doubles against Pittsburgh to lead
the third-place Cardinals to a 12-4 win. Hornsby will go hitless in the last
two games, dropping his final average to .397 for the year (.405 on the road)
still the best in the NL. Teammates Austin McHenry and Jack Fournier will
be 2nd and 3rd in hitting in the NL.

Prior to the Braves-Giants game, the Giants Old Timers take on the Giants
regulars in a 5-inning contest. Twenty thousand fans cheer as former stars,
Christy Mathewson, Roger Bresnahan, George Wiltse, Art Devlin, Larry Doyle
and Fred Tenney whip the current Giants, 2-0. The regular game is called
because of rain after one inning, but only 4,000 fans ask for a refund.

In Cleveland's 3-2 win over the White Sox, Chicago catcher Ray Schalk
throws out 3 runners at 1B in the 8th inning for a ML record. He is the
2nd AL catcher to register 3 assists in a frame. The pickoff victims are
Charlie Jamieson, Joe Wood and Elmer Smith. Stan Coveleski is the winner
for the Tribe.

1922
The Yankees clinch their 2nd pennant by beating Boston, 3-1, behind Waite
Hoyt and Joe Bush. The last-place Sox finish the year 33 games behind the
Yankees, but have a winning margin (13-9) for the year against New York. They
lost the season series to every other team.

In the 2nd of two at Cubs Park, the Cards whip the Cubs, 5-3, in a game
stopped after 5 innings. The big blow for the Birds is a 3-run homer in
the 1st inning by journeyman infielder Del Gainer off Cubs lefty Percy
Jones. When Jones is lifted, so is Gainer, who closes out his career with
the homerun. The Cards also take the opener, 9-8.

1923
On Zack Wheat day in Brooklyn, the Phils' Cy Williams ties the score in the
7th with his 39th homer and seals the win in the 12th with his 40th. The
Phils win, 6-4. Wheat has 2 hits and receives an automobile. Wheat finishes
last in fielding this year with a dismal .908 percentge after leading the
circuit with a .991 last season.

At Chicago, Hack Miller hits a 2-run HR in the 8th to give the Cubs a 5-4
win over the Pirates. Reb Russell hits a 2-run HR for the Bucs, his ball
rolling under the screen in RF in the 6th inning for an inside-the-park homer

The NL champion New York Giants wrap up their home season with a 4-3 10-inning
win over the Braves. Moses Solomon, the "Rabbi of Swat," drives in Frisch
with a double in the 10th. Solomon, who hit a minor-league record 49 homers
at Hutchinson this year (a 50th was washed out August 26th), breaking Perry
Werden's 1895 record of 45 at Minneapolis, is 3 for 4 in his ML debut. But
this is his only ML season. Hack Wilson, who made his ML debut yesterday,
is 2 for 4. Young Bill Terry, who debuted on the 24th, is 1 for 3. Solomon
will hold the homerun record for just a year ... Clarence Kraft will hit
55 at Ft. Worth next year.

1924
In the only game scheduled, the Series-bound Senators lose a laugher,
13-1, to the Red Sox. Coach Nick Altrock, 48, pitches the last 2 innings
for the Nats and gives up a run, while driving in the lone tally with a
triple. With the Red Sox outfielders making little attempt to run the ball
down, Altrock is the oldest player in ML history to hit a triple. Howard
Ehmke is the winning pitcher but still leads the AL in losses with 17,
the same number of losses he's had the previous 2 years.

1927
On the next-to-last day of the season, with the score tied at 2-2 in the 8th,
Mark Koenig triples and moments later Ruth launches his historic No. 60 off
Washington's Tom Zachary for a 4-2 win. The ball is caught by 40-year-old
Joe Forner of Manhattan. Ruth, who had singled in his first two at-bats,
walked, and scored three runs is greeted with a handkerchief salute by the
fans as he makes his way to his right field position. In the 9th Walter
Johnson makes his final appearance as a player, pinch-hitting for Zachary
and flying out to Ruth. Ruth hit 17 HRs in September, the highest month's HR
output till Rudy York's 18 in August of 1937. The Babe is the first player
to hit 30, 40, 50 and now 60 homers.

1928
In his major league debut, White Sox rookie Ed Weiland shuts out the
second-place A's at Comiskey Park, 1-0. The A's leave 12 men on base.
The 6'4" fireballer from Chicago will finish his four-year tenure with his
hometown team compiling a 5-15 record before being traded to the Red Sox
in 1932.

In Washington's 9-1 win over the Browns, Washington OF Goose Goslin, for the
3rd day in a row, gets 2 hits, one a 9th-inning looping single, to edge the
Browns OF Heinie Manush .379 to .378. It is Goose's only batting title in
his 18-year career. Nats' ace Sam Jones volunteers to pitch to stop Manush,
while Blaeholder tries the same for St. Louis. Blaeholder gets Goslin in
his first 2 at-bats, but Goose then hits a 5th-inning HR.

1933
In the season finale, the last-place White Sox lose to Cleveland,
5-3, finishing the campaign with a 53-99 record, 47 games out of first
place. Chicago did not throw a single left-handed hurler during the entire
season.

At Sportsman's Park, in a 12-2 romp over the Cardinals, Babe Herman of the
Chicago Cubs hits for the cycle, the 3rd time he has performed the feat
(in 1931 he did it twice with the Dodgers). Guy Bush wins his 20th game,
beating Dizzy Dean who finishes the season at 20-18.

With the visiting Phillies leading 1-0 in the 4th, Boston's Wally Berger
clouts a grand slam and the Braves hold on to win, clinching 4th place. It
is Boston's highest finish in 14 years.

1934
Dizzy Dean clinches the pennant with his 30th win, a 9-0 shutout of the
Reds. Diz loads the bases in the 9th inning, then fans two Reds and gets
the 3rd to foul out. Dean's 7th shutout of the year is the Cards' 20th win
in their last 25 games. Today's final game draws 35,274 to Sportsman's Park,
but the season attendance total for the Cards is just 325,056, an average of
4,222 a game. The Reds are low in the NL with 206,773 total attendance. By
comparison, the AL winning Tigers draw 919,161.

The Dodgers again beat the Giants, 8-5. The Giants knock out starter Ray
Benge with 4 runs in the 1st, but can manage just a solo HR, by P Freddie
Fitzsimmons, in 6 2/3 innings against knuckleballer Dutch Leonard. Brooklyn's
10-inning win is sweet revenge for the Dodgers, who had been fuming since
Bill Terry's wisecrack at the February 6th NL meetings. Dodger manager
Casey Stengel later cackles, "The Giants thought we gave 'em a beating,
but I'm sorry for the beating they still have to take. Wait until their
wives realize they're not going to get those new fur coats."

Detroit wins a pair to finish the season with 101 wins as they beat St. Louis,
10-6 and 6-2. Charley Gehringer is 2 for 7 to finish at .356 as Gehrig goes
3 for 4 to win the batting title with .363. Grover Hartley, the last active
Federal League veteran, comes in at catcher in game 1. He'll have one game
next year as a ML ump.

The Senators top the visiting Yankees, 5-3, in Babe Ruth's last game in
pinstripes. Preceding the game, a band from St. Mary's Industrial School,
the Babe's alma mater, plays. Ruth is 0 for 3 in this, his 2,084th and
final game as a Yankee. He flies out to CF in his last at-bat and leaves
crying. Senators pitcher Orville Armbrust toils 7 innings in recording his
only major league win, 5-3. Gehrig is 3 for 4 to sew up the Triple Crown.

In Cleveland, in between halves of the Indians-White Sox doubleheader, Cy
Young, 67, and his fellow "Antiques" take on Walter Johnson's "Has-Beens." A
Johnson pick off attempt on Nap Lajoie in the 2nd and last inning turns into
a near-riot and "umpire" Martin Lavelle has to be escorted off the field by
police. In the field events Al Simmons hits a fungo 428'6" while Hal Trosky
wins the throwing contest with a toss of 376'2". Evar Swanson circles the
bases in 14 and 4/5 seconds. The Sox win, 9-5, behind Ted Lyon's pitching and
Al Simmons' hitting as he goes 5 for 5. The Sox then lose, 5-3 in 5 innings.

1936
In the WS opener, Carl Hubbell outpitches Red Ruffing scattering 7 hits
and limiting the Yankees to a solo HR by George Selkirk. The underdog
Giants take a decisive 6-1 win.

1937
The New York Giants clinch the flag with a 2-1 victory by Carl Hubbell
for his 22nd win. The loss goes to Phils starter Hugh Mulcahy, his 18th
defeat, who will earn the sobriquet "Losing Pitcher." The Giants lose
the nitecap, 6-2. Blondy Ryan has a homer, the 3,000th in Giants history.

The Indians sweep a pair from the White Sox behind the pitching of
Johnny Allen and Bob Feller. Allen's 6-4 birthday win in the opener is
his 15th straight of the year and 17th in a row going back to July 10,
1936. Feller wins his 9th, 4-1, and strikes out 11. Moose Solters has
3 RBIs in each game while Hal Trosky has 4 RBIs for the day to reach 100.

1938
In Cincinnati, Paul Derringer pitches the Reds to a 4-1 win in the opener
of a twinbill. Jim Tobin takes the loss. In the 2nd game, Russ Bauers,
who did not get out of the 2nd inning yesterday, wins, 4-1.

In St. Louis, the Cubs-Cards game ends in a 7-7 tie. Johnny Mize has a
homer and 2 singles.

Jimmie Wilson resigns as manager of the Phillies. He will be replaced by
Doc Prothro.

1939
In a split with the Browns, White Sox reliever Clint Brown sets a ML record
with his 61st relief appearance. Chicago takes the opener, 5-1, then drops
the nitecap, 7-5.

The Senators beat the A's, 9-5, behind rookie Joe Haynes' pitching. He
allows 11 hits, including native Philadelphian Al Brancato's 1st ML HR. A's
PH Elmer Valo walks, but at Connie Mack's behest, official scorer Red Smith
removes his name from the boxscore because Valo has not signed a ML contract
(in 1972, Smith wrote a letter about this to Jim Charlton). Thus, Valo will
later miss joining the four-decade list.

1941
Thirteen ML clubs draft 17 minors leaguers. The winners are the Giants
taking Sal Maglie (Buffalo); Braves taking C Clyde Kluttz (Sacramento);
Cubs taking Hi Bithorn (Hollywood).

1942
Down 7-0 to Red Ruffing in the Series opener, the Cardinals storm back for
four 9th-inning runs, not enough to win but enough to portend the result
of the WS.

1944
Pitching on two days rest, Hal Newhouser wins his 29th as Detroit whips
Washington, 7-3.

The Browns remain tied with Detroit as Dennis Galehouse goes all the way,
winning, 2-0, over New York for his 9th victory of the year. Gene Moore hits
his 6th homer of the year, four of them coming against Yankee pitching. Paid
attendance is 12,982. The loss eliminates the Yankees and leaves the Tigers
and Browns tied with one game left.

In the battle of the Soxes, Boston beats host Chicago, 11-2, as Catfish
Metkovich scores 5 runs.

1945
Hank Greenberg's grand-slam HR in the 9th inning on the final day of the
season beats the St. Louis Browns, 6-3, and clinches the AL pennant for
the Detroit Tigers. Virgil Trucks, discharged 3 days earlier from the Navy,
is the starter, with Newhouser relieving in the 5th. The continuing drizzle
rains out the unnecessary 2nd game after one inning. The Tigers had been
assured of a tie on September 26 when Newhouser won his 24th game, an 11-0
shutout of the Indians. There were 3 off days before the season finale
today. The 2nd-place Senators finished the season on the 23rd.

In a 12-2 Yankee win over Boston, George Stirnweiss gets 3 hits on the final
day to raise his average to .309 (actually .30854 to Cuccinello's .30845). The
3rd hit comes in the 8th, off Otis Clark, in his last at-bat. The White
Sox-Cleveland games are washed out, depriving the veteran Tony Cuccinello of
a shot at the title. The only other .300 hitter playing full time is teammate
Johnny Dickshot (.302). Neither Cuccinello nor Dickshot ever play another
game in the ML as the White Sox release the two veterans. Only Elmer Flick
in 1905 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1968 ever led the AL with a lower average
than Stirnweiss, but the latter also leads the AL with 195 hits, 107 runs, 22
triples, 301 TB, 33 steals and a .476 SA. He also led the AL in at-bats (632)
to Cuccinello's 402. Snuffy is also the only major leaguer to finish a season
as the top hitter without ever having led at any point during the season.

Eddie Stanky draws a walk his first time at-bat, his 148th walk of the year,
from Hugh Mulcahy to break Jimmy Sheckard's NL mark. The Dodgers beat the
Phils, 4-1, as 2,241 frostbitten Philley fans look on.

In the first of 2 at Boston, Don Fisher of the Giants shuts out the Braves,
1-0 in 13 innings, winning on Nap Reyes' homerun. It is just the 6th time in
ML history that a scoreless extra-inning game has been won on a solo homer
(his reward? ... one at-bat in 1950). Fisher is just the 3rd pitcher this
century to fire a shutout in his last appearance, and the 1st of 4 this
century to throw a shutout in his only start. Luis Aloma, in 1951, is the
next. The second game ends in a 7-inning 2-2 tie. Tommy Holmes is 4 for 6
in game one, and needing a 3 for 4 in game 2 to overtake Cavarretta for the
batting crown, he comes up short, going hitless in 2 appearances. Cavarretta
is 2 for 4 in the Cubs' 5-3 win over the Pirates to finish at .355. Holmes
hits .352.

1946
In a great trade for Boston, the Braves send 2B Billy Herman and 3 players
(P Elmer Singleton, OF Stan Wentzel, INF Whitey Wietelman) to Pittsburgh
for 3B Bob Elliott and C Hank Camelli. The Pirates want Herman to manager
and in his only season, 1947, he'll guide them to a last-place finish. But
Elliot will win the NL MVP in Boston.

1947
Ralph Branca becomes the youngest player to start a World Series opener. At
Yankee Stadium, the 21-year 9-month old right hander and the Dodgers lose
to the Bronx Bombers. Hitless the first 4 innings, the Yankees score 5 runs
in the 5th inning when 6 straight runners reach base, and they win the World
Series opener, 5-3. A record WS crowd of 73,365 at the Stadium pays $325,828.

1948
The idle Indians watch their lead shaved to 1 1/2 games as both the Red
Sox and Yankees win. Mel Parnell stops the Senators, 7-3, for his 15th
victory. In the rain at Shibe Park, the Yankees edge the A's, 9-7. Vic
Raschi pitches the 9th for a save.

1949
Boston benefits from 14 walks and outlasts Washington, 11-9, to move into
New York for the showdown for the AL pennant. The Nats outhit the Sox an
astounding 18-5 in the game, but strands 11. The Nats score 2 in the 9th
against Ellis Kinder, who relieved in the 8th and struck out the side,
but Sam Mele grounds into a game-ending DP.

Earle Mack, A's assistant manager and son of Connie, plans to start
sore-armed Phil Marchildon against the Yankees, but changes his mind when
he receives a flood of critical telegrams. Mack goes with Dick Fowler,
who twirls a 4-hitter to beat the Yankees, 4-1. Ferris Fain's 3rd-inning
3-run homer off Eddie Lopat is the big blow, while Ben Chapman adds a solo
HR. Eddie Joost is 1 for 3 with a walk to end his season with more walks
(149 - not an AL high) than hits (138). In 1947 he had 114 walks and 111
hits while hitting .206 average.

Ralph Kiner hits his 54th homer and 16th in September, as the Pirates beat
Herm Wehmeier and the Reds, 3-2. The monthly total eclipses Cy Williams'
1923 NL mark. Kiner's blow is a tremendous drive over the scoreboard in LF
at Pittsburgh.

1950
Before 23,879 at Ebbets Field, Brooklyn pulls within one game of the lead,
as Erv Palica wins, 7-3, over the Phillies. The Brooks rout rookie Bob Miller
and then Duke Snider and Roy Campanella pound homers off Jim Konstanty. It
is the Phillies' 5th loss in a row, their 8th in 10 games. The red-hot
Dodgers have now won 13 of their last 16 games. For the 2nd year in a row,
the pennant race will come down to the last game. If the Dodgers win tomorrow,
the race will end in a three-way tie.

P Gerry Staley and George Munger combine for a doubleheader sweep of the
Cubs when the Cards win, 2-0 and 4-0.

1951
Larry Jansen of the Giants holds on to defeat the Braves, 3-2, in Boston
as Bobby Thomson hits his 30th HR of the year, and Don Mueller and Monte
Irvin each drive home a run.

Jackie Robinson hits an upper deck HR in the 14th inning off Robin Roberts,
who came on in the 8th, to give the Dodgers a critical 9-8 win over the
Phils. Robbie saves the game in the 13th by making a great catch of an Eddie
Waitkus line drive and throwing to 2B for a DP. In the process, he injures
his elbow. Reliever Bud Podbielan is the winner, the victory keeping Brooklyn
in a first place tie with the Giants. Catcher Andy Seminick of the Phils
walks 5 times, the first Phillie to do so in a game. The Dodgers overcome
a 6-1 deficit to win and set the stage for a playoff with the Giants.

Preceding the Browns' season closer, the Harlem Globetrotters defeat a
team led by baseball clown Max Patkin. The basketball game is played on
a wooden court set up behind 3B. Then St. Louis ace Ned Garver cops his
20th game of the season, defeating the White Sox, 9-5. He breaks a 4-4 tie
with a homerun. Garver becomes the only player to win 20 for a last-place
team that loses 100 games, as the Browns win just 32 other times. The last
20-game winner for a last place team was Hollis Thurston in 1924, with the
White Sox (66-87).

The Tigers drive over the slumping Tribe, 2-1, behind Virgil Trucks' 13th
win of the year.

At Pittsburgh, Ralph Kiner hits a 425-foot grand slam in the 11th inning
to give the Pirates an 8-4 win over the Reds.

The triumphant Yankees beat the Red Sox, 3-0, behind Frank Shea's 9-hitter. It
is the 3rd shutout in a row for the Yankees staff as they sweep the visiting
Red Sox in 5 games, outscoring them 29-4.

In Chicago, the Cubs and Cardinals split a pair. In the opener, the Cubs
come back from a 6-1 deficit and score 5 runs in the 8th to win, 7-6. Hank
Sauer's 30th homerun with 2 on is the big blow in the 8th. Gerry Staley
tosses a 4-hitter in game 2 to beat the Cubs, 3-0. Musial sits out the last
game at the suggestion of Marty Marion ending a streak of 121 straight games
played. Starting next season he'll play 744 in a row. Had he played game 2
he would notch a streak of 865, better than Gus Suhr's NL 822 consecutive
games played.

1953
The Yanks defeat Brooklyn, 9-5, in the first game of the WS. Carl Erskine
is ineffective, walking the first 3 batters, and all score on a Hank Bauer
triple. The Dodgers tie it up 5-5, and Clem Labine gets the loss in relief.

1954
With lefty Johnny Antonelli going the distance, the Giants defeat Early Wynn
and the Indians, 3-1, in game 2. Dusty Rhodes drives in all the Giants'
runs with a pinch-hit single and a solo HR. The Indians' only score is a
first-pitch HR by leadoff hitter Al Smith.

The Cubs sell 3B Bill Serena to the White Sox. Tomorrow the Cubs send
pitchers Johnny Klippstein and Jim Willis to the Reds for P Harry Perkowski,
and outfielders Jim Bolger and Ted Tappe.

1955
The Dodgers' Johnny Podres defeats Bob Turley who fails to last 2 innings
against the Bums. C Roy Campanella leads the attack with 3 hits and 3 RBIs,
as Brooklyn wins, 8-3, behind the strong effort of lefty Johnny Podres.

1956
At Forbes Field on the last day of the season, Sandy Amoros and Duke Snider
each hit 2 HRs, as the Brooklyn Dodgers win, 8-6, over Pittsburgh to cop
the pennant on the last day of the season, finishing a game ahead of the
Braves. Snider belts his 42nd and 43rd homers to help Newcombe win his
major-league leading 27th. Newk's win is the most ever in a season by an
African-American pitcher.

The Braves, losers of the first 2 games in the series, beat the Cards, 4-2,
to finish a game ahead of the 3rd-place Reds.

In the first of two games, the Giants beat Robin Roberts and the Phils,
8-3. Roberts serves up homers to pitcher Al Worthington, who hits his only
ML homer, and a pair to Bill White and has now thrown 46 gophers, a new ML
record. He also fails in his bid to win 20 for the 6th straight year. White's
pair gives him the Giants rookie record with 22. In the nitecap, Giants 2B
Red Schoendienst gets the 2,000th hit of his ML career, but the Giants lose,
5-2. Schoendienst also finishes the season with a .9934 fielding average,
a mark that will last for 30 years until Ryne Sandberg breaks it.

Al Lopez, manager of the Indians since 1951, resigns and is replaced by
Kirby Farrell. Lopez, who won 470 while losing 354 for a .570 percentage,
had one pennant and five 2nd-place finishes in his 6 years at the helm.

White Sox hurler Jim Derrington becomes the youngest pitcher in modern
history to start a game. At the age of 16 years 10 months, he loses to
Kansas City, 7-6. The $50,000 bonus baby gives up 3 runs in 6 innings,
then 3 more before being lifted in the 7th. He also singles, the youngest
person to get a hit in the 20th century.

Veteran Joe Frazier closes out his career with great style by blasting 5
hits, good for 10 bases, in a doubleheader against the Senators. In the
nitecap, Frazier doubles in the 8th off Ted Abernathy, just the 2nd hit
the submariner allows, and then homers in the 9th to pace the Orioles to
a 6-3 win. The HR comes on Joe's last ML at-bat.

At Cleveland, Detroit manager Harris brings in Billy Hoeft to relieve in
the 4th inning and enables the southpaw to get credit for his 20th win,
8-4, over the Indians. Following a pre-arranged plan, Hoeft takes over for
Garver, pitching for the 1st time since July 26, with a 4-0 lead. Foytack
throws the last 2 frames. Harvey Kuenn drives in 3 runs to give him 88 for
the year, 85 RBIs from the leadoff position. This sets a new ML record
for leadoff hitters that will be broken in 1997, by Garciaparra. Kaline
is 1 for 3 with a 6th-inning triple. The loss goes to Bob Feller (0-4),
who pitches a complete game in his last ML appearance.

1958
In the Phillies' 6-4 10-inning win at Pittsburgh, Richie Ashburn clinches
the batting title going 3 for 4 to finish at .3495. Mays, leading off in
SF's win over St. Louis, is 3 for 5 to finish at .3466. Dave Philley sets
a ML record for consecutive pinch hits when he doubles in the 7th for his
8th straight pinch hit. Peanuts Lowrey had 7 straight pinch hits in 1952.

1959
The Red Sox fire clubhouse attendant Johnny Orlando. Orlando was hired as
a bat boy in 1925.

1960
The Yankees beat the Red Sox, 6-5, and set a new AL record for homers with
192. Tony Kubek and Jesse Gonder hit the homers today as the Bombers win
their 13th straight.

1961
In a battle of tail-enders, the Cubs beat the Mets, 5-1, behind Bob
Buhl. Willard Hunter is the loser as the two teams total 99 victories.

1962
Willie Mays' 47th HR, an 8th-inning blast off Dick Farrell (10-20), leads
the Giants to a critical 2-1 win. They then stay in the clubhouse to hear
the results of the Dodger game.

Gene Oliver's dramatic 9th-inning HR off Johnny Podres gives Curt Simmons
and St. Louis a 1-0 win against the Dodgers and a three-game sweep at
Chavez Ravine. The heartbreaking loss for LA forces the 4th playoff in NL
history. The Giants won 5 of their last 7 games, but only 7 of their last
17, while the Dodgers managed just 3 wins in their last 13 games.

P Bill Fischer of the Athletics concludes a ML-record string of 84 1/3
consecutive innings without allowing a base on balls, a record that tops
Christy Mathewson's mark. Fischer walks Bubba Morton on 4 straight pitches
and loses a 6-1 decision to Detroit. During his walkless streak his record
was 2-10. His streak started on August 3 when he walked leadoff batter
Bubba Phillips, then pitched 8 walkless frames.

In the 2nd of two, Red Sox 1B Don Gile, hitting 1 for 40 on the year (his
one hit came in game 1) breaks a 1-1 tie with a 2-run homer in the bottom of
the 9th off Washington's Jack Jenkins. The homer comes in his last ML at-bat
and gives Bill Monbouquette the win, 3-1. The Yawkeymen lose the opener by
the same score as Cheney fans 12. Don Lock drives in all 3 runs. Runnels
sits out the games and ends the season with the AL batting crown at .326.

At Yankee Stadium, Chicago's Ray Herbert tops New York, 8-4. Mantle,
batting leadoff to give him needed at-bats, is 2 for 3 and qualifies for
2nd place in hitting (.321) with 502 plate appearances. He also hits a HR,
giving him 8 straight seasons of 30+ homers.

In the Mets' inaugural season, the Cubs turn a triple play and beat visiting
New York, 5-1, a 20th-century ML-record 120th loss for the Mets. Catcher
Joe Pignatano of the Mets hits into the triple play in the 8th inning,
his last at-bat in the major leagues. Ken Hubbs starts the play catching
a sure single, which goes 4-3-5. Richie Ashburn plays his only game at 2B,
going the distance, making an error, but starting a 4-3 DP.

Camilo Pascual draws a tough assignment in rookie Bob Miller, but beats
the Orioles, 1-0, on 3 hits to earn his 20th win. Miller allows 2 hits to
the Senators.

With manager Mel McGaha fired for next season, Indians pitching coach Mel
Harder guides the Tribe to a sweep of a twinbill of the Angels, winning 4-3
and 6-1. Harder, 1-0 last year, completes his managerial career at 3-0. Mel
McGaha, a guard with the 1948-49 NY Knickerbockers of the BAA, didn't play
major league baseball, but will come back to manage the A's in 1964-65.

1964
The Phillies lose their 10th straight game as Curt Simmons of the Cards beats
Jim Bunning, 8-5. The Phils now trail by 2 1/2 games with just 2 to play,
but have a glimmer of hope since the Cardinals have 3 games left against
the 10th-place Mets.

A total of 36 strikeouts, 19 by Pittsburgh batters, ties the NL record for
whiffs in the Pirates' 1-0 squeaker against the Reds in 16 innings. Jerry
Mays' squeeze bunt scores the lone run. The loss drops the Reds out of 1st
place with 3 games left.

In his first ML at-bat, pinch hitter Bill Roman debuts with a homer, the only
one of his brief ML career. Even so, the Tigers lose to New York, 7-6, as a
Mickey Mantle leadoff HR in the 2nd off Lolich ignites a 5-run rally. New
York takes the nightcap, 11-8, for a sweep in NY. Roman will accumulate
only 37 career plate appearances during a brief two-year stint in Detroit.

In a rarity at Fenway, the Indians shut out the Red Sox in a doubleheader,
winning 5-0 and 3-0. Rookie Luis Tiant and Sam McDowell go the distance in
applying the whitewashes.

1965
Don Drysdale (23-12) pitches a 3-hitter and blanks the Braves, 4-0. Los
Angeles has now won 13 straight games, 7 by shutouts.

1966
At Comiskey Park in the top of the ninth inning, Roger Maris, in his last
at-bat as a Yankee, slams a two-run homerun as a pinch-hitter putting the
club ahead of the White Sox, 5-4. As the slugger contemplates retirement,
the former two-time American League MVP is stunned and embarrassed when
New York trades him in the off-season to the Cardinals for utility player
Charley Smith. The White Sox win in the end, 6-5. The Yanks will win their
next 2 but finish in 10th place one-half game behind the Red Sox.

For the 2nd time in a week, a pitcher takes a no hitter into the 9th
inning only to lose it on a leadoff hit. This time it is the Mets' Ed
Bressoud breaking up a bid by Houston's Larry Dierker. Dierker wins, 1-0,
over Jack Fisher.

1967
Manager Billy Hitchcock (77-82) is fired by the Braves.

Jim Davenport sets a NL record with his 64th straight errorless game - 137
chances - at 3B for the Giants. San Francisco wins a pair over the Phils,
3-2 and 1-0.

Boston beats the Twins, 6-4, to tie Minnesota for first place. Carl
Yastrzemski's 3-run HR gives him the AL lead with 44, but Killebrew answers
with his 44th for the losers.

Meanwhile, Detroit, which had games rained out on the 28th and 29th, plays
2 with the Angels. Lolich wins the opener, 5-0, his 3rd straight shutout,
and Detroit takes a seemingly safe 6-2 lead into the 8th inning of the
nitecap. The Angels then bat around, scoring 6 runs, to hand Detroit a
devastating 8-6 loss. Detroit now trails Minnesota and Boston by a half-game.

1968
AL and NL umpires form a new Association of Major League Umpires. They
will strike in the spring of 1969 unless Al Salerno and Bill Valentine are
reinstated by the AL.

Cal Ermer is dismissed as manager of the Twins.

1969
The Braves clinch the first-ever National League West division with their
3-2 win over the Reds at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The Lum Harris led
club will finish the season three games ahead of San Francisco, but will
be swept by New York in the NLCS. Hoyt Wilhelm saves Phil Niekro's 23rd
win today by retiring the last 6 batters. Niekro ends the regular season
allowing no sacrifice flies in 284 innings, a record.

1970
The Yankees' Fritz Peterson wins his 20th, defeating the Red Sox, 4-3. Billy
Conigliaro and Alvarado, with his career first, go deep for Boston.

1971
Tom Seaver, for the second time in his career, becomes a 20-game winner
when the Mets beat St. Louis, 6-1, at Shea Stadium on the final day of
the season. Enroute to the complete game victory, 'Tom Terrific' whiffs 13
Redbirds to end the campaign with a league-leading 289 strikeouts.

The Giants win the Western division title by one game over the Dodgers,
beating the Pirates, 5-1. Marichal allow 5 hits in the win. The Dodgers'
2-1 win over the Padres leaves them short.

The Senators draw 14,000 for their final game in Washington, with another
4,000 crashing. Dick Bosman gives up homers to Bobby Murcer, Roy White
and Rusty Torres and the Nats are down, 5-1, in the 6th. Mike Kekich
then grooves a fastball for Frank Howard, who parks his 26th homer,
and thanks Munson as he crosses the plate. The Senators take a 7-5 lead,
and after Murcer makes the 2nd out in the 9th, fans swarm onto the field,
causing the game to be forfeited to the Yanks, 9-0. All records stand but
reliever Paul Lindblad losses the W by not recording the 3rd out, batter
Horace Clarke. Of the Senators, Jeff Burroughs will be the last to retire,
finishing up in 1985. Don Mincher becomes the only player to be on the
roster for both final games played in Washington for each team known as the
Senators. The lefty-swinging first baseman will also be the only person to
play for both the original Minnesota Twins and the original Texas Rangers,
the franchises that left the nation's capital, respectively, in 1960 and 1971.

Chicago finishes the season by edging the last-place Brewers, 2-1, on Bill
Melton's 33rd HR of the year. Melton is the first AL HR leader in Sox history.

1972
Pirates outfielder Roberto Clemente doubles off Met Jon Matlack in the 4th
to become the 11th major leaguer to collect 3000 hits. The two-bagger, sadly,
will be his last hit as he will die in a plane crash on New Year's Eve. Dock
Ellis allows 1 hit in 6 innings for the 5-0 win. This is Clemente's 2,433rd
game for the most ever played by a Pirate (surpassing Honus Wagner).

The Tigers take their 3rd in a row from Milwaukee as John Hiller throws a
5-hitter. Aurelio Rodriguez' 3-run HR is the margin in the 5-1 win. The
Tigers now return home to face the Red Sox in a 3-game series that will
determine which team wins the East.

1973
Playing in their final game at the 'old' Yankee Stadium, the fourth-place
Bronx Bombers lose unceremoniously to the Tigers, 8-5. The team, which
will play its home games for the next two seasons at Shea Stadium as
the 50-year-old 'House that Ruth Built' undergoes extensive renovations
(costing $27.9 million), also loses their skipper with Ralph Houk announcing
his resignation.

After posting an 88-73 record, Eddie Kasko is fired as manager of the
second-place Red Sox on the last day of the season. Triple-A Pawtucket
pilot Darrell Johnson is named as next season's skipper.

Going into today, a five-way tie is still possible in the NL between Montreal,
Pittsburgh, New York, St. Louis and Chicago. In the first of two, Chicago
wins, 1-0, over the Mets behind Bob Locker's 2-inning relief effort, then
is eliminated when New York wins game 2 by a 9-2 score. Jerry Koosman tops
Fergie Jenkins. The two teams will play a make-up doubleheader tomorrow.

Pittsburgh eliminates the Expos, 10-2, behind a complete game effort by
Jim Rooker. The Bucs play a makeup game tomorrow with the Padres.

Ron Bryant wins his 24th and the visiting Giants beat the Reds, 4-3. Bobby
Bonds has 3 hits and 3 RBIs. Tony Perez hits a two-out homer in the 7th to
break up Bryant's no-hit bid. The Reds draw 50,776 to go over the 2-million
mark in attendance for the first time in team history.

Angel Ron Perranoski announces his retirement after 13 years as one of the
premier relief pitchers in the major leagues.

1976
The Chicago White Sox try a different approach against California, using
a lineup in numerical order by field position. As noted by historian Greg
Beeson, the batting order is:  Downing - 2, L. Johnson - 3, Stein - 4,
Bell - 5, Dent - 6, Bannister - 7, Lemon - 8, Hairston - 9. Finishing off
the lineup is 53-year-old DH Minnie Minoso. The Angels are unimpressed,
winning, 7-3, behind Sid Monge. Facing Monge for the 2nd time this year,
Minnie is 0 for 2. Minnie's next appearance will be on October 4, 1980.

1977
Lou Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals steals the 900th base of his career
in a 7-2 win over the New York Mets at Busch Stadium, becoming just the
second man in baseball history to reach the plateau.

1978
Baltimore 2B Rich Dauer makes his only error of the season in the final
game, a 5-4 loss to Detroit. Dauer's 86 games and 425 chances without a
miscue are AL records.

The Phillies overcome a first-inning grand slam by Willie Stargell to
beat the Pirates 10-8 and finally clinch the NL East title for the third
consecutive season. Winning P Randy Lerch contributes 2 HRs to his cause. The
loss snaps the Pirates' streak of 24 straight wins at Three Rivers Stadium.

At Fenway, Dennis Eckersley notches his 20th win of the year as the Red Sox
defeat the Blue Jays, 5-1. Eck allows just 4 hits, including Roy Howell's
8th homer, in completing his 16th start.

The Yankees top the Indians, 7-0, behind Ed Figueroa's 20th win of the
year. The Yanks clinch a tie for the pennant.

1979
In his final major league at-bat, Ed Kranepool pinch hits a double off
Bob Forsch in New York's 4-2 win over the Cardinals at Busch Stadium. The
35-year-old veteran, who broke in with the Mets as a 17-year-old in 1962,
has the longest tenure in franchise history playing 18 seasons with the
club. Kranepool is the last original Met left in the majors.

Minnesota's Jerry Koosman defeats Milwaukee, 5-0, on the final day of the
season for his 20th win of the year. It is the only time the Brewers are
shut out the entire year, as they fail to tie a record set by the Yankees
in 1932. The Brew Crew scored in 213 straight games.

Two ML managers bite the dust. The Padres fire Roger Craig and the Blue Jays
do the same to Roy Hartsfield. San Diego will hire broadcaster Jerry Coleman
the next day, while Toronto will hire scout Bobby Mattick on October 18th.

The Niekro brothers each win their 21st game and tie for the NL lead in
wins. Phil wins for the Braves, 7-2, over the Reds, while Houston's Joe tops
the Dodgers, 3-2. Phil Niekro (21-20) is the only pitcher this century to
lead the league in wins and losses in the same season.

1980
In front of only 1,754 patrons, Mets southpaw Pete Falcone beats the Pirates
in the season's last game at Shea Stadium, 3-1. It is the smallest crowd
ever to attend a game at the Flushing ballpark, 33 less fans than yesterday.

A's OF Rickey Henderson sets the AL single-season stolen base record with
his 97th in a 5-1 win over the White Sox, breaking Ty Cobb's record of 96
set in 1915. Henderson will finish the season with 100 stolen bases.

After Seattle goes ahead 6-5 in the 14th, George Brett hits a 3-run homer,
his 24th, to give Kansas City the 7-5 victory. Brett will finish the season
with 24 homers and 22 strikeouts ... only Barry Bonds in 2004 will have
fewer strikeouts than homers (minimum 10 homers) since 1959. The loss goes to
Mike Parrott (1-15) while Quissenberry (12-7) nails the win. The aptly named
Rick Honeycutt will earn an ejection in the 3rd inning for cutting the ball.

In a 12-9 Cleveland win over the Yankees, the Tribe's Ron Hassey has a
double and HR in the 8-run 2nd inning. There are 4 homers in the game,
including Reggie Jackson's 38th.

Dodger rookie Fernando Valenzuela wins his first ML game, beating the Giants,
4-1. Pedro Guerrero has a HR.

1981
In the last ML game at Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium, Kansas City
clinches at least a tie for the AL West 2nd-half title with a 5-2 win
over the Twins. Next season, the Twins will play in the brand-new Hubert
H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis.

1983
The Dodgers beat the Giants, 4-3, and the Padres beat the Braves, 3-2,
giving Los Angeles the NL West title. Orel Hershiser pitches the final 2
innings in relief of Fernando Valenzuela to record his first ML save.

In a 9-4 win over the Mariners, Chicago's LaMarr Hoyt records his 13th
win in a row to raise his record to 24-10, and Greg Luzinski hits his 32nd
homerun to set a new single-season record for designated hitters.

1984
On the final day of the regular season, California's Mike Witt fans 10 and
needs just 97 pitches to complete a perfect game, 1-0, over Texas. Witt's
gem is the first 9-inning perfect game in Angels history and the first
in the major leagues since Len Barker's in 1981. Charlie Hough is today's
loser on an unearned run.

In the dramatic race for the AL batting title, Don Mattingly goes 4 for
5 in the Yankees' season-ending 4-2 win over the Tigers to edge teammate
Dave Winfield .343 to .340. Winfield goes 1 for 4.

The 7th-place Brewers end their season with a 4-0 win over the Blue Jays,
and manager Rene Lachemann bows out. Lachemann had been fired earlier in
the week but stayed on till the finish. George Bamberger will return as
manager of the Brewers.

The ML umpires announce that they will go on strike at the 2 LCS games
scheduled to begin October 2nd in an effort to improve their pay and
job security and to change the method by which post-season assignments
are determined. ML officials say the games will go on as scheduled using
amateur umpires if necessary.

Phillies interim manager Paul Owens resigns following a season-ending
doubleheader loss to the Pirates and will move into the club's front
office. Coach John Felske will succeed Owens as manager next season.

Padre Eddie Miller and Dodger Tony Brewer hit homers today in their last
major league at-bats. Miller's 9th-inning four bagger, his only career homer,
comes in a 4-3 loss to Atlanta's Pascual Perez, while Brewer, the 1984 PCL
bat champ, homers in LA's 7-2 win over the Giants.

1985
Trying to circumvent the Mariners' 'escape clause' which is based on
attendance at the Kingdome, the King County Council attempts to modify the
deal it made with the team. A proposed amendment, making it necessary for
the club to play .500 ball before a move could be considered, a record the
M's have never achieved, angers owner George Argyros so much he threatens
to move the team out of Seattle.

Bret Saberhagen pitches a CG win over the Angels to win his 20th game of
the year. The win gives the Royals a tie for 1st place in the AL West. Brett
and Sundberg homer for KC.

1987
Dave Stewart becomes a 20-game winner (the first in the majors this season)
when the A's beat Cleveland at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, 4-3. The
thirty-year-old right hander, who spent the first decade of his career in the
bullpen, will also earn twenty or more victories in the next three seasons.

1988
Joining Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Dwight 'Doc' Gooden, David Cone
improves his record to 20-3 becoming the fourth pitcher in Mets history to
win twenty games in a season. After his 4-2 complete-game victory against
the Cardinals, the 25-year-old right-hander is congratulated by a surprise
visitor to the Shea Stadium dugout, former president Richard Nixon.

At Wrigley Field, President Ronald Reagan throws out two ceremonial first
pitches prior to the Cubs' 10-9 loss to the Pirates. 'Dutch', a former

spending the first inning and a half in the WGN booth.

The Red Sox lose to Cleveland, 3-2, but clinch the AL East title anyway
when 2nd-place Milwaukee loses to Oakland, 7-1.

Dave Stieb is one out away from a no-hitter for the 2nd consecutive game,

Fred McGriff. Stieb finishes with his 2nd straight one-hitter, 4-0, over
the Orioles.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1989
In the ninth inning of a 2-0 three-hit loss to Nolan Ryan and the
Rangers, Angels shortstop Dick Schofield strikes out looking becoming
the right-hander's 300th victim of the season. It is the sixth time the
'Ryan Express' has reached the plateau, but the first since striking out
341 batters in 1977.

Ending a 43-year relationship with Major League Baseball, NBC airs its final
regular season Game of the Week. The contest, which features the Blue Jays

is the 981st broadcast of a weekly tradition which began in 1947.

Baltimore, after spending nearly three months in first place, is eliminated
from the pennant race on the next-to-last day of the season when they suffer
their second consecutive one-run loss to Toronto, allowing the Blue Jays to
clinch first place in the AL East. The Blue Jays earn the final spot in the
playoffs by scoring 3 runs in the bottom of the 8th to win, 4-3. The young
group of players known as the "Why Not?" Orioles, led by Frank Robinson,
improved in the standings by 32 1/2 games from their last-place finish
last season.

1990
Pittsburgh beats St. Louis, 2-0, behind Doug Drabek's 3-hitter to clinch

last for the first time since 1918.

Harold Reynolds of the Seattle Mariners grounds out, shortstop Scott Fletcher
to first baseman Steve Lyons, giving the Chicago White Sox a 2-1 victory in
the final game to ever be played at historic Comiskey Park. Bobby Thigpen
is on the mound to earn his 57th save, establishing a Major League record
for saves in a season. The stadium is to be torn down after 80 seasons
of major-league ball. The final regular-season won-loss record at the old
ballpark is 3,024-2,926 (.508). Chicago will play next season at the new
Comiskey Park located across the street.

1992
George Brett of the Royals gets the 3,000th hit of his career, stroking 4

games to set a new modern NL record.

1995
Cleveland OF Albert Belle socks his 50th HR of the season in the Indians'
3-2 win over the Royals. The HR is Belle's 17th of September, tying Babe
Ruth's record for the month. Beginning September 13, Belle has hit 13 homers
in 16 games (he did not play 9/24), tying Frank Howard's mark set in May
of 1968. With today's homer, Belle becomes the first player ever to have
50 homers and 50 doubles in a season.

over the Red Sox to even their series at 1 game apiece. David Justice has
a homer and 4 ribbies for the Tribe.

1999
Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez plays in his 96th consecutive game without
committing an error breaking Cal Ripken's major league record for errorless

the record to 100 games.

The largest regular-season crowd in Candlestick Park history, 61,389 fans,
watches the Dodgers beat the home team, 9-4 in the last baseball game to
ever be played at the 'Point'. Giant greats help mark the occasion with
Juan Marichal tossing out the ceremonial first pitch before the game and
Willie Mays throwing out the ballpark's final pitch after the game.

For the twenty-third time this season, Diamondback fireballer Randy Johnson
K's at least 10 batters to tie Nolan Ryan's 1973 major league record for
the most double-digit strikeout games in a season. The tall left-hander
whiffs 11 Padres in seven innings in a 5-3 victory to bring his season
ending total to 364 which ranks fourth all-time.

2000
Don't mess with Texas? The Athletics pound the Rangers, 23-2, in the highest
scoring game in Athletics history, and also the most runs allowed by Texas in
a game. Oakland scores 9 runs in the 1st inning, capped by Randy Velarde's
2-run HR. Miguel Tejada hits a grand slam in the 5th, the ML record 14th of
the year for Oakland and 8 more A's are plated in the 7th. Fourteen players
score runs to set a new ML record. Barry Zito is the easy winner.

The Mariners outslug the Angels, 21-9, scoring in every inning but the
5th. It is the most runs ever scored against the Angels and the 2 teams
combine to have 18 players scoring runs in the game, one short of the
AL record. Alex Rodriguez drives home 7 runs for Seattle, with 4 hits,
including 2 HRs, his 39th and 40th, as the M's collect 5. A-Rod has now
reached 40 homers in 3 seasons. The M's remain a half game behind the red
hot A's and a game ahead of Cleveland in the wild card race.

The White Sox whip the Royals, 9-1, as Jose Valentin hits HRs from both
sides of the plate.

2001
Todd Helton's 2B is his 100th extra base hit of the season. He is
the 1st player in history to have 100 extra base hits in back-to-back
seasons. Lou Gehrig and Chuck Klein were the only others to do it twice
in their careers. Colorado scores 8 runs in the 3rd inning and calcimines
Milwaukee, 10-0.

Tampa Bay and Luis Pujols exiting from Detroit.

New Yorkers, 3-1, to take the opening game of their Division Series.

themselves in the pitcher's duel between Schmidt and Florida's Josh Beckett.

Giles homers for Atlanta.

2004
Thanks to Bernie Williams' ninth-inning two-run homer, the Yankees beat the
Twins, 6-4, to clinch their seventh straight American League East Divisional
title. It is also their 100th victory of the season making the club only
the fourth team in history (Braves 1997-99; Orioles 1969-71; A's 1929-31)
to have three consecutive 100-win seasons.

2005
The Devil Rays announce the team will buy out the last year of manager Lou
Piniella's $13 million four-year deal signed in 2002. The agreement, which
pays 'Sweett Lou' $2.2 million of the $4.4 million he is owed, allows the
62-year-old skipper to seek employment with another team.

Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki becomes the first player in baseball
history to collect 200 hits in each of his first five seasons in the big
leagues. The Japanese native, who was last season's AL batting champ, joins
Willie Keeler (1894-1901), Wade Boggs (1983-89), Chuck Klein (1929-33),
Al Simmons (1929-33) and Charlie Gehringer (1933-37) as the sixth major
leaguer to have reached this plateau for at least five consecutive seasons.

Albert Pujols' 40th homerun, a seventh-inning grand slam against the Reds,
makes him the first Cardinal in the 114-year history of the team to hit
that many homeruns in three consecutive seasons. The homer, which was also
the 200th of his career, makes the first baseman the third-youngest player
to reach the milestone with only Mel Ott and Eddie Matthews accomplishing
it sooner.

2006
Five years and two cities after Frank Robinson, then the vice president
in the commissioner's office in charge of on-field discipline, accepts
Bud Selig's offer to take the MLB-owned Expos' manager job for just one
season, the franchise, now known as the Washington Nationals, will have a
new skipper. Jim Bowden, the team's GM, announces the 71-year-old Hall of
Famer will be replaced with the search for a new field boss beginning after
tomorrow's season finale against the Mets at RFK.

The Mariners edge the Rangers, 3-1. Ichiro Suzuki steals his 39th consecutive
successful stolen base to extend his AL record. He hasn't been caught
stealing since April 16.

The Royals defeat the Tigers, 9-6. Kansas City begins the game with a double,
single, triple and homer, giving the team a cycle with its first 4 batters.

Down 8-0 after three innings at Wrigley, the Cubs come back on the Rockies
to tie at 9 apiece. The Rocks finally push across two runs in the 14th to
win, 11-9. The two teams each use 10 pitchers which ties the ML record.

The Angels beat the Athletics, 7-6. Oakland's Jason Kendall becomes the
first player in ML history to catch 140 games in 8 different seasons,
breaking Gary Carter's record.

2007
With the help of New York losing 6 of 7 of their last games (all at home)
and squandering a seven game game with 17 to play, the Phillies clinch the
NL East title for the first time in 14 years by beating the Nationals on
the last day of the season, 6-1. The Mets' colossal failure down the stretch
is considered by many to be the worst collaspe by a team in baseball history.

With 13 victories in the last 14 games of the season, the Rockies beat the
Diamondbacks to force a one-game play-off with the Padres to determine the
National League wild card team. San Diego, who was one strike away from
clinching a post-season yesterday, loses again today to the Brewers ending
the season with the same record as Colorado, 89-73.

Jimmy Rollins triples to become only the fourth big leaguer to record 20
stolen bases, 20 homers, 20 triples and 20 doubles in a season. The Phillies
shortstop and MVP candidate joins Frank Schulte (1911 - Cubs), Willie Mays
(1957 - Giants) and Curtis Granderson (2007 - Tigers) as the only players
in major league history to accomplish the feat.

2008
With its 1-0 tiebreaker win over the Twins, the White Sox become the first
team in major league history to defeat three different opponents in three
days. Chicago beat the Indians on the last scheduled day of the regular
season to necessitate the playing of a previous rain out with the Tigers,
which the Southsiders won, 8-2, making today's game with Minnesota necessary
to determine the AL Central divisional championship.

2009
In the Marlins' 5-4 victory over Atlanta, Ricky Nolasco sets a franchise
record with 16 strikeouts. The 26-year-old right-hander's performance
includes whiffing nine consecutive batters, one shy of the major league
record set by Tom Seaver with the Mets in 1970.

The Phillies clinch their third straight division title with a 10-3 victory
over Houston. If the team wins the World Series this year, the reigning
World Champions will become the first National League team to win two in
a row since the Reds won consecutive Fall Classics in 1975-76.

Francisco Rodriguez becomes the fourth pitcher in the history of the game to
yield two walk-off grand slams in the same season when Justin Maxwell goes
deep giving Washington a dramatic 7-4 victory over the Mets at Nationals
Park. Last month, Everth Cabrera of the Padres also hit a game-ending
four-run four-bagger making K-Rod the only major leaguer to surrender two
game-winning grand slams to a pair of rookies.

2011
The Red Sox do not pick up their option on Terry Francona's contract,
severing ties with their manager for the past eight seasons. The former
Boston skipper, who was at the helm for the team's 2004 and 2007 World
Championships, could not halt the club's historic collapse in September,
losing a playoff spot to Tampa Bay when the team posts a meager 7-20 record
in the final month of the season.

2012
The Braves win for the 23rd straight time in a game started by Kris Medlen
when they beat New York in the regular-season home finale at Turner Field,
6-2. The 26-year-old right-hander's streak surpasses the major league mark
shared by Carl Hubbell (Giants, 1936-37) and Whitey Ford (Yankees, 1950-53).

David Price becomes the first 20-game winner in franchise history when he
goes seven innings in the Rays' 6-2 win over the White Sox at U.S. Cellular
Field. The 27-year-old southpaw, the youngest American League pitcher to
win 20 since Johan Santana reached the milestone with Minnesota in 2004,
will edge Tigers' ace Justin Verlander for the AL Cy Young Award.

2013
In a one-game tie breaker to determine the AL's second Wild Card team,
Rays ace David Price allows just seven hits enroute to a complete-game 5-2
victory over the Rangers in Arlington. Tampa Bay will take on the Indians
for the Wild Card spot in the playoffs, and Texas, after winning its last
seven contests of the regular 162-game season, will miss the postseason
for the first time since 2009.

The Mets extend manager Terry Collins' contract for another two years,
adding a club option for 2016. During his three-year tenure with New York,
the 64-year-old skipper, who has also managed the Astros and Angels, has
guided the the team to 225-261 record, the lowest winning percentage (.463)
of his major league managerial career.
