1901
In the 2nd of 2 games with Milwaukee, the White Stockings hit a ML-record 5
triples in the 8th inning against Milwaukee. Their total of 6 (Hoy, McFarland,
Shugart, Sullivan, Mertes, Hartman) in the game is an AL record not duplicated
until September 17, 1920. Chicago wins, 9-4, after taking the opener, 5-4,
and hitting 4 triples. Chicago with 9 and Milwaukee with 1 will go into
the record books for most triples by two teams in a doubleheader (10). In
2004-05 researchers will confirm that the record is 12, set in a July 4,
1907 doubleheader by the Browns and Detroit.

It could've been worse. The Detroit Tigers roll over Cleveland behind
Ed Siever with the most lopsided score in AL history:  21-0 (equaled on
August 13, 1939). Cleveland pounds out 24 hits off rookie Jack Bracken as
Pop Dillon leads the way with 4 hits. The game is mercifully called after 7
1/2 innings to allow Cleveland to catch a train. Bracken's ERA is not helped
by this outing and he will end this season, his only one in the majors,
with a 6.21 mark, the highest in the Deadball Era.

1902
Chicago's infield combo of Tinker, Evers and Chance pull off another double
play to back up Carl Lundgren's 6-3 win over the Reds.

1903
In Cincinnati, the Reds knock out Mathewson after 5 innings and beat the
Giants, 8-0.

1904
Giants rookie Hooks Wiltse wins his 12th straight game, beating Boston,
3-2, at the Polo Grounds. Hooks sets a ML mark for consecutive games won
at the start of a career, a record that will be tied by relief hurler Butch
Metzger, in 1976. He'll end up at 13-3.

Boston edges New York, 3-2, to move back into first place in the AL. Jesse
Tannehill allows 9 hits in besting Al Orth. The nitecap is called after 9
innings with the score 1-1.

1906
The White Sox win their 4th straight from the Browns, 6-4, to move back
into first place. New York splits with Washington.

1907
At the Browns-Tigers doubleheader in St. Louis, a soda bottle thrown by
a fan, Hugo Dusenberg, fells umpire Billy Evans. The crowd beats up Hugo
before the police come to his rescue; he is fined $100. Evans is carried
from the field and hospitalized, but is not very seriously injured. The
Browns lose 2, 6-3 and 3-2.

1908
The Cardinals rattle Red Ames for 5 hits in the 8th inning to tie the Giants
at 4-4. Cardinal killer Christy Mathewson relieves and when Bridwell scores
the go-ahead run, Matty stops the Birds for his ML record 24th consecutive
win over St. Louis.

The Highlanders' Pete Wilson makes his major league debut by shutting out
Boston, 1-0.

1910
Cleveland tops Washington, 3-0, with Walter Johnson losing to the Naps
after 4 straight wins against them. The victory goes to Fred Blanding in
his major league debut. Nap Lajoie scores a run but is 0 for 3.

1911
Washington manager Jimmy McAleer announces his resignation. Ban Johnson
then arranges for McAleer and Robert R. McRoy to buy a half-interest in
the Red Sox for $150,000. Clark Griffith will take over as manager and,
by purchasing 10% of the team, be its largest single stock holder.

1912
In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, Boston's Joe Wood wins his 16th straight
game as he bests the Browns, 2-1, in a game called after 8 innings because
of darkness. Wood scores the winning run in the 8th, scoring from 3B on a
wild pitch by Earl Hamilton. Earlier in the year, Walter Johnson posted a
streak of 16 straight wins.

1913
Frank L. Hough, sports editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, and one of 2
writers who owned 25 percent of the Athletics when the team was founded, dies.

1914
Cleveland's Nap Lajoie strokes his 3,000th hit, a single off Detroit's Pug
Cavet, joining Wagner and Anson as the only players to reach that mark. Cavet
and the Tigers win, 2-1.

1915
The Cubs edge the Braves, 1-0, behind Phil Douglas, with Lefty Tyler taking
the tough loss. Tomorrow, the Cubs will win another 1-0 battle, but it will
take them 12 innings to do it.

1916
The Giants, sporting a 9-game winning streak, are losing 2-0 to Cincy in
the 4th inning when rain washes out the game.

1917
The Senators toss shutouts in both games today with the A's. Harry Harper
wins the opener, 5-0, and Walter Johnson follows with a 4-0 victory.

At the Polo Grounds, Boston's Babe Ruth takes an 8-0 lead into the 9th
before allowing 3 Yankee runs. He finishes with a complete-game 8-3 win
and slugs his 2nd and last homer of the season.

1919
At Philadelphia, A's pitcher Jimmy Zinn hits a pinch 3-run homer in the
9th inning off Chicago's Red Faber, his 1st ML homer. His next will come
in 10 years. After Zinn's HR, Jackson catches the next ball against the
fence and Faber escapes with an 11-10 win.

1920
The Indians give Jim Bagby 14 runs on 22 hits and he coasts over the A's,
14-0.

1921
Four A's pitchers help the Indians win game 1, 17-3, by contributing 16
walks. Among them is the starting pitcher Arliss Taylor, appearing in his
only ML game. He fans one batter - Joe Sewell, the hardest batter to strike
out in ML history. Charley Jamieson scores 5 runs. Cleveland wins game 2, 6-0.

Babe Ruth hits HR No. 55 in New York's 10-6 win over the Browns. The Yanks
take game 2, 13-5.

1922
C Butch Henline is the first NL player to hit 3 homers in a game since 1897,
as the Phils beat the Cards, 10-9. Henline hit no homers last year. His 3rd
HR ties the game in the 9th inning and Cliff Lee then hits the game-winning
HR. Lee ends the year with 17 homers - all at the Baker Bowl. Only Gavvy
Cravath, in 1914, and Mel Ott will have more homers in a season this century
coming all at home.

The Browns pull to within a half game of the Yankees - losers to the White
Sox - by rallying to beat the Red Sox, 7-1. Vangilder scatters five hits
to win. St. Louis trailed, 1-0, after 6 1/2 innings before coming back.

1923
Paul Strand, RF for Salt Lake City (PCL), makes his 290th hit, a pro baseball
record. He will play in 194 games, make 325 hits, including 66 doubles,
13 triples and 43 HRs, for a .394 BA, with 180 runs and 187 RBIs. He also
has 612 total chances in the OF. Strand, 30, had come up to the Braves
as a pitcher in 1913 and was 6-2 for the 1914 pennant winners, mostly in
relief. The Athletics will pay a reported $100,000 (which Mack later says
was really $40,000) for him, but he will hit just .228.

1926
The Yankees beat the Indians, 6-4, as Bob Meusel drives home three runs with
three sacrifice flies. This ties the ML record set by Harry Steinfeldt in
1909. Bob Shawkey is the winning hurler.

1928
The Braves play their ninth consecutive doubleheader. The streak, which
began on September 4th, sees the team lose five in a row, including four
to the Giants.

In a doubleheader with the Phils, the Cardinals leave 29 runners on base
but still manage to win both games, 3-2 and 8-6. Stranding 29 is a record
for 2 regulation-length games.

At Boston the Cubs manage to split with the Braves, winning the nitecap,
6-1, after dropping the opener, 5-2. Ben Cantwell bests Charlie Root in
game one, and Guy Bush does the same to Ed Brandt.

1929
Between games of a twinbill, Cincinnati entertains fans by sponsoring
a base-circling contest with the winning player recieving $75 in prize
money. Evar Swanson (a former college track star) breaks Hans Lobart's
record of 13.8 seconds set earlier in the year as he completes the 360 foot
dash in 13.3 seconds, according to official AAU timers who officiated the
race. Two years from now, with more sophisticated equipment timing him,
he will do it in 13.2 while with Columbus (American Association).

The Yankees and Indians trade shutouts, with New York winning the opener,
1-0, behind Tom Zachary (11-0). Zachary allows 4 hits. In the nitecap,
Willis Hudlin is even stingier, giving up 3 singles, as Cleveland wins,
10-0. It is Hudlin's 14th win over New York in the past three seasons.

1930
The Dodgers win their 11th straight, 13-5, to sweep the Reds and keep
a one-game lead on the Cardinals. Brooklyn scores 6 in the first, the
7th straight game they've scored in the opening frame, to knock out Red
Lucas. They would've scored more in the frame ... Glenn Wright's liner
reaches the bleachers but the shortstop, unsure if the hit is a HR, runs
hard and passes baserunner Babe Herman at 1B. It is the 2nd time this season
that Herman has been passed on the basepaths on a HR.

Newspapers carry the story of the strange disappearance of Cardinals P
Flint Rhem on the eve of a crucial series in Brooklyn. Rhem will reappear
in two days.

The Cubs split a pair in Philadelphia when Lefty O'Doul again pinch-hits
a HR, this time in the 9th, to beat the Cubs, 12-11, in the first game. It
is the 2nd consecutive game that O'Doul has produced a pinch-hit homer. In
the 2nd game of the day's doubleheader, Hack Wilson hits his 50th HR to
pace the Cubs to a 6-4 win.

1931
The Philadelphia Athletics clinch the pennant, beating Cleveland at home,
14-3. Every starter for the A's has a hit and a RBI. Eddie Rommel, veteran
knuckleball pitcher for the A's, is the winning hurler, as Connie Mack wins
his 3rd successive pennant. It is Mack's 9th, and last, AL championship. The
A's went into first place for good on May 5th, when they started a win
streak of 17 straight games and 20 of their next 21. In mid-July they won
13 straight.

1932
At the Polo Grounds, Kiki Cuyler continues to haunt the Giants by clouting
an 11th-inning homer to give the Cubs the 8-7 win.

The Cardinals' Ray Starr makes his first major league start, shutting out
the Dodgers, 3-0.

1933
The Giants sweep a pair from the Cubs at Wrigley Field, winning 5-1
and 4-0. Reliever Hi Bell helps apply the whitewash in game 2, besting
Lon Warneke. Starter Tarzan Parmalee is leading, 3-0, when he hits Tuck
Stainback on the arm breaking it. He walks the bases full and Bell comes in.

1935
Before an overflow Sunday crowd of 41,284 in St. Louis, the Giants' Carl
Hubbell outpitches Dizzy Dean to give New York a 7-3 win. It is the 2nd
time in 4 days the two aces have matched up. The Giants, winners of 14 out
of their last 22 games, are now just 1 1/2 games behind the Cardinals.

Boston rolls over the Browns, 9-5, as Lefty Grove posts his 14th straight win
over St. Louis. His streak began in August of 1932 when he was with the A's.

In Washington, Cleveland takes a pair from the Senators, 16-4 and 6-3. Mel
Harder and Willis Hudlin pick up the victories. Left-handed hitting Hal
Trosky, mired in a 1 for 40 slump, turns to switch-hitting against the 2
lefty Nats starters, Buck Rogers and Dick Lanahan. As noted by Clem Comly,
Trosky goes 4 for 9 with a homer, then hitting lefty is 1 for 1 to finish
the day with 5 hits.

1936
Johnny Allen wins his 20th for Cleveland, though he is forced to leave
the game with a back injury, after hurling 5 innings of no-hit ball. Oral
Hildebrand finishes for him as Cleveland rolls over Boston, 13-2. Hal Trosky
has his 39th and 40th homers, plus a single and a double to pace the Tribe.

1937
Two weeks ago, AL President Will Harridge upheld Cleveland's protest of
the August 6 Yankee win, and the entire game is replayed as the 2nd game
of today's doubleheader. The protested game is called a tie with all stats
retained except those following the disputed call. The Indians take the
regularly scheduled game, 5-4, then lose the replay, 3-1.

1938
At the Polo Grounds, Pirates P Jim Tobin puts Giants star Mel Ott in the
record book, hitting him three times with pitches. Tobin wins, 7-2. Brothers
Lloyd and Paul Waner of the Pirates hit consecutive HRs off Cliff Melton
in the 5th inning. This is the 3rd time both will have HRs in the same
game, but the first time off the same pitcher. It is also the only time in
history that brothers hit back-to-back homers. For Lloyd, it is his last
major-league homer.

1940
Washington stops first place Detroit, 6-1, behind knuckleballer Dutch Leonard.

The Indians sweep the A's, winning 5-0 and 8-5. Feller wins the opener,
allowing no hits until Dick Siebert bloops a single in the 8th inning. Feller
allows one other hit and walks none.

On "Ted Lyons Day" at Comiskey Park, the veteran pitcher is given a $1550
auto purchased with dimes contributed by fans. The Comiskeys add a check for
$1800, and there is cash and gifts from his teammates. Moe Berg contributes
a money clip. Lyons completes the celebration by beating the Red Sox on 3
hits for his 232nd victory. His 2.10 ERA will lead the AL, the only time
he's been best in that.

1941
After 16 scoreless innings, the Dodgers score 5 in the top of the 17th and
beat the Reds, 5-1. Johnny Allen, acquired on waivers from the Browns,
pitches 15 innings for Brooklyn, allowing just one hit in the first 9
innings, before he's lifted for a pinch runner with the score 0-0. A tired
Reds starter Paul Derringer finally gives up a 17th-inning homer to Pete
Reiser, and is lifted after two more hits. Hugh Casey wins in relief as
the umps order the Reds to forget about stalling to get the game called on
account of darkness. The Dodgers now lead by 2.

The Red Sox hammer the White Sox, 6-1, winning for the 16th time in 22
meetings. Mickey Harris is the winner over Johnny Rigney. Ted Williams hits
his 35th of the year, with 6 of the homers coming off Johnny Rigney to tie
a ML record.

1942
The visiting Cards trip the cellar Phils, 3-2 in 14 innings, when
reliever Murry Dickson doubles and scores on Jimmy Brown's single off Si
Johnson. Johnson goes the distance for the Phils in losing his 7th of the
year to the Cards. St. Louis starter Mort Cooper gives up a tying homer to
Nick Etten in the 8th. After coach Chuck Klein pinch hits and bounces out
to end the game, manager Hans Lobert races to the second deck to confront
a fan who had been heckling him throughout the game, especially after his
decision to insert the little-used Klein. Lobert is restrained from punching
the fan by Klein.

1944
Radio announcer Bill Stern reports on a scandal involving the Browns. A
Chicago newspaper attributes the Browns' recent slump to the fact that
the team wants a larger park for the WS. Four days later, Stern repudiates
the story.

1945
In Washington, Detroit opens a 5-game series against the 2nd place Senators
by breaking 6th-inning ties in each game to sweep a pair, 7-4 and 7-3. The
losses drop the Nats 2 1/2 games back.

1946
After dropping the opener, 4-3 in 10 innings, the Brooklyn Dodgers are
stinging the Chicago Cubs, 2-0, at the end of the 5th inning when a swarm
of gnats descend upon Ebbets Field and causes the game to be called off
early. The Dodgers take the win away as Kirby Higbe allows just one hit,
a second inning safety by Mickey Livingston.

Ernie Lombardi of the Giants slams the ball 483 feet under the stairway
in right-center of the Polo Grounds, but barely makes 3B. It is the 3rd
triple in 7 years for Schnozz and the last of his career. The Cardinals
still sweep 2 from the Giants, but at a cost. After Murry Dickson's 3-0
win in the 1st game, Howie Pollet preserves the Cards' 7-4 victory in the
2nd game, but suffers some arm pain when he doesn't warm up sufficiently.

Senators reliever Early Wynn smacks a grand slam homerun against Detroit's
Johnny Gorsica as the Nats roll by Detroit, 15-5. Wynn wins over Dizzy Trout.

The A's Bill McCahan makes his first ML start and blanks the Indians, 2-0,
in a game called after 7 innings. The Browns Fred Sanford also makes his
first start a shutout, stopping the Yankees, 1-0.

At Chicago, Red Sox pitcher Dave "Boo" Ferriss notches his 25th win,
beating the White, 4-1, in the first of two. Johnny Rigney then applies
the whitewash to the Red Sox to win the nitecap, 6-0, on 3 hits.

1947
The Sox - Red and White - combine for a AL record-tying 12 double plays in
their doubleheader split today. Chicago wins the opener, 6-3, then loses, 7-5.

1948
Warren Spahn stops the Cubs, 5-2, and the Braves will have the day off
tomorrow.

The White Sox score 10 runs in the 7th to knock out the Red Sox, 17-10. Ted
Williams, with 5 hits, leads the Red Sox, now just a game and a half ahead
of New York.

1949
Pirates P Ernie Bonham dies following an appendectomy and stomach surgery,
just 18 days after his last pitching performance, an 8-2 win over the
Phillies. Mrs. Bonham will receive the first benefits under the players
pension plan, $90 a month for 10 years.

1950
For a ML-record 6th time, Johnny Mize hits 3 HRs in one game, but the
Yankees lose, 9-7, at Detroit. Mize matches Ruth's mark of doing it in
both leagues, but the Babe only had 2 three-homer games. With the victory,
the Tigers recapture first place from New York.

Ted Williams returns to the Red Sox lineup and raps a HR and 3 singles in
a 12-9 defeat of the Browns. The Red Sox will come within 2 games of the
first-place Yankees this week, but will end up in 3rd place, behind both
New York and Detroit.

In game 2, Eddie Waitkus of the first-place Phils gets 5 hits for the 3rd
time this season, as the Phillies beat the Reds, 8-7 in 19 innings. Teammate
Del Ennis goes 5 for 10. The Reds lead, 5-0, after 5 innings, but the Phils
tie it up in regulation. Both teams score twice in the 18th, and the Phils
score in the 19th on a bases-loaded hit by Del Ennis. The Phils win the
lid lifter, 2-1, and move to 7 1/2 over the Dodgers.

At Ebbets Field, Cloyd Boyer, the Cardinals' scheduled starter against
Brooklyn, injures his arm during his warm-ups and has to depart, getting
credit for the game start although he never faced a batter. Red Munger
replaces Boyer and goes the distance, being awarded a complete game for
his effort, a 6-2 Cards win. The loser is Don Newcombe, who had beaten the
Redbirds 4 straight this year.

1951
The 7th-place Pirates rise up and collect 15 hits to whip the first-place
Dodgers, 11-2. Rookie Jack Merson drives home 6 runs on a triple, double
and 2 singles.

The Giants trim the Dodger lead to 5 games when they cash in homers by
Thomson, Mays and Mueller for a 5-2 win over Chicago. Sheldon Jones tops
Paul Minner.

The Cardinals take 11 walks, a record-tying 5 by Solly Hemus, and beat the
Braves, 10-1. Boston's starter Dave Cole walks the first 3 batters he faces,
then hits Enos Slaughter to force in Hemus.

The first game of the first Dominican WS (Los Grandes Finales) is played
between Licey and Escogido in Santiago. Behind the hitting of Alonzo Perry
(.400 series average) and the pitching of Marion "Sugar" Caine, Licey wins
the opener, 8-0, and goes on to take the series, 4-1, to become the first
champion of Dominican Professional Baseball.

1952
The Pirates become the first team to wear helmets in which the temples are
protected. The headgear is worn both at the plate and in the field.

The Dodgers tie a club record by hitting 5 HRs to defeat the Reds, 11-5,
and stay 3 games ahead of the Giants. Robinson and Snider hit 2 apiece,
while Hodges hits a solo for his 100th RBI. A crowd of 2,612 is the smallest
at Ebbets Field since 1934.

In a Cold War move reported in New York, the Russians decry the American game
of baseball by citing their own game of "lapka" as being the progenitor of
baseball. They call American players "slaves." The State Department links
the Soviet claim as the founders of baseball as part of its "Hate America"
campaign.

1957
The slumping Braves drop their 8th in 11 games, losing to the Phillies,
3-2 in 10 innings. The Braves lead in the NL is down to 2 1/2 games.

1958
Snuffy Stirnweiss is killed when the New Jersey commuter train in which he
is a passenger plunges off the CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge between Elizabethport
and Bayonne. The 39-year-old former All-Star infielder, who played with
the Yankees, Browns and Indians, led the American League in hitting with
a .309 average playing for New York in 1945.

1959
Carl Yastrzemski plays for Minneapolis (AA), but the game is protested by
Omaha because Yaz is not eligible to play until OF Lee Howell leaves for
military duty on the 18th.

Mays has 4 hits and 5 RBIs. The Giants are now 2 games in front with 8
to play.

York, 4-3. All the Yankee scoring comes on 2 homers by Mantle.

1960
At Connie Mack Stadium, Giants superstar Willie Mays ties a major league
mark by hitting three triples in an 8-6 victory over the Phillies. The
'Say Hey Kid' collects 5 hits in 6 at-bats. His third three-bagger of the
game in the eleventh inning off Turk Farrell leads to the eventual go-ahead
run. Mays also strokes a double and a single. The last National Leaguer to
hit 3 treys in a game was Roberto Clemente in 1958.

1961
With 10 strikeouts in an 11-2 win against the Braves, Sandy Koufax has 243
strikeouts, most ever for a NL lefty.

The Yankees set a new AL record for most homers in a season (222), as
they split a doubleheader in Detroit, winning 11-1 and losing 4-2. Circuit
blows by Skowron and Berra in the opener help Whitey Ford win his 24th and
increase New York's homer total to 222. This breaks the old mark set by
the 1947 Giants and tied by the 1956 Reds. Cash and Steve Boros homer in
the nitecap to back Ron Kline's 7-hitter.

1962
The Pirates beat Jack Sanford, 5-1, the first loss by the Giant hurler after
16 straight wins. Bob Bailey, in his ML debut, hits a 2-run triple to ice it.

striking out 7. He leaves after one out in the 7th after his hard throwing
causes him to break 2 ribs. With 2 outs in the 9th, the Twins score 3 against
Funk to win, 3-2. Lee Stange, in relief, gains his first ML win. McDowell,
just recalled from Portland (PCL), where he compiled an 8-0 record, including
a one-hitter and a no-hitter in consecutive starts, will go 11-4 this year.

At Wrigley Field, the Dodgers beat the Cubs, 6-4, with a little help from
Frank Howard. Hondo is 4 for 4 with a homer, and has 2 assists from right
field. He'll end the year with 19 assists.

1963
Inspired by their fans, the Mets hold the first of many Banner Days. The
Polo Grounds event gives the 'New Breed' an opportunity to display their
creative ideas with signs, including some with a negative tone, with an
on-the-field parade between games of a doubleheader against the Colt .45's

1964
At Wrigley Field, Larry Jackson fires a six-hitter beating the Reds, 6-1,

Cubs.

1966
Tom Phoebus of Baltimore begins his ML career with a 2-0 shutout of the
Angels.

the Indians. Kansas City wins its 7th straight game.

Don Drysdale (10-16) gives up two HRs in the 9th, to Roberto Clemente and
Willie Stargell, with 2 outs, but holds on to give the Dodgers a 5-3 win
over Pittsburgh. The Dodgers now lead the Bucs by 2 1/2 games. The Bucs
and Dodgers will split the next 2 games.

1967
At the spacious Astrodome, Jimmy Wynn becomes the first Astro to hit three
homers in one game. The "Toy Cannon's" performance isn't enough as the
Braves beat Houston, 9-8.

There are just two runs scored in the Phils-Dodgers doubleheader, and Los
Angeles scores both, winning 1-0 in each game. In game one, Phils OF Tony
Gonzalez is 2 for 4, giving him 30 hits for his last 55 at-bats.

1968
The Cardinals clinch the NL pennant with a 7-4 win at Houston. Roger Maris
hits his 275th, and last, regular-season HR, off Don Wilson in the 3rd,
and Curt Flood racks up 5 hits.

1969
Cardinal hurler Steve Carlton fans nineteen batters, including three in the
ninth, to establish a new major league mark for strikeouts in a single game,
but loses the game to the Mets, 4-3. Ron Swoboda hits a pair of two-run
homers spoiling Lefty's performance.

Denny McLain records his 9th shutout, a Tiger record, beating New York,
2-0, at Yankee Stadium.

The Dodgers sweep a pair from the Reds, winning the nitecap in 12 innings. Jim
Brewer wins both games with an inning of relief in the opener and 4 more
in the 2nd game.

1970
The White Sox hire manager Chuck Tanner from the Pacific Coast League. He
replaces Don Gutteridge, who had been fired on September 3rd. Coach Bill
Adair ran the team in the interim.

Ken Holtzman wins his 15th, and the Cubs top the Cardinals, 5-3. Chicago
moves into 3rd place, just a game behind the first-place Mets and Pirates.

1971
The Oakland A's win the American League West division with their 3-2 victory
over Chicago and the Royals' 6-2 loss to California. The franchise hadn't
won a title since 1931 when Connie Mack managed the team in Philadelphia.

At Shea Stadium, Mike Jorgenson hits a 2-out single in the 7th to break
Burt Hooton's no-hit bid, and Ken Singleton follows with a homer to tie
the match at 2-2. But Billy Williams clocks a pinch homer in the 9th and
Hooton finishes the 3-2 victory with 15 strikeouts, notching his first ML
win. In the opener of the twi-night DH, Bill Hands beats Jerry Koosman,
6-2. Hands starts the Cubs' scoring with a 2-run single in the 2nd.

At Houston, the Braves win, 4-2, as Aaron belts his 44th homer of the
year. The RBI is his 1,954th, tying him with Ty Cobb for 3rd place on the
all-time list. In the 9th inning, Larry Yount is announced as the new pitcher
for Houston. The rookie injures his right shoulder on his very first warm-up
pitch, and the 21-year-old right-hander will never get another chance to
pitch in the bigs. The total major league experience for Robin's older
brother will consist of just one-warm up pitch.

The Giants suffer their 3rd straight loss and their 10th in 11 games,
losing to the Reds, 4-2. The Giants maintain their 1-game lead in the West.

for a 9-inning game, the Padres winning, 1-0, on Cito Gaston's 4th-inning
homer. Winning P Fred Norman strikes out 15, while Don Gullett fans 11
Pads. Pedro Borbon notches the other 2. Norman (9-9) notches his last win
of the season and will finish as the only pitcher in history with fewer than
10 wins in a season with 6 shutouts (Ewell Blackwell was close in 1946 with
5 shutouts in 9 wins ... in one win, he was ahead 2-0 when he was relieved
after 8 1/3 IP).

1974
On a bright, sunny day at Fenway Park, Rico Petrocelli is struck behind
the left ear, below the helmet, when he loses Jim Slaton's pitch due to the
blinding glare off the outfield bleachers. The beaning, which causes inner
ear damage, results in the third baseman missing the rest of the season and
will hasten his early retirement prior to the start of the 1977 season at
the age of 33.

Gaylord Perry goes the distance for his 20th victory when he beats Baltimore
and Ross Grimsley at Memorial Stadium, 1-0. The right-hander, who will

the twentieth century to win twenty games.

1975
Late-season call-up Mike Vail extends his hitting streak to a rookie-record
23 straight games as the Mets edge the Expos, 3-2.

Braves rookie Al Autry goes 5 innings and gets the win in a 4-3 decision over
the Astros. Willie Montanez' 3-run homer is the big blow for Atlanta as a
crowd of just 970 watches. For Autry, this is his only big league decision
... Earl Huckleberry, of the 1935 A's, is the last pitcher to bow out with
a 1-0 record.

Red Sox lefty Roger Moret holds on for a 9-7 win over the visiting
Brewers. Jim Colborn takes the loss. For Moret, this is his last win as
a Red Sox as he'll go to Atlanta over the winter after a 14-3 season. For
the years 1970-75 he finishes with an 18-7 record at Fenway, the 2nd best
Red Sox lefty at home.

1977
The Orioles forfeit to the Blue Jays when manager Earl Weaver pulls his
team off the field in the 5th inning citing a hazardous condition - a small

win streak to 16 games, the 6th longest win streak this century. Oakland
again falls, 7-6 and 5-4. The Royals now lead by 10 1/2 games. The 16-win
streak is the longest in club history.

The Yankees purchase Dave Kingman from the Angels. It's Kingman's 4th team
this year:  he started the season with the Mets, was traded to San Diego
in June, and to the Angels for cash on September 6. King Kong will hit
4 homers for the Yankees, giving him 26, a since-broken record for most
homers in 2 leagues in one season (Deron Johnson hit 20 in 1973).

1978
The Dodgers become the first ML team ever to draw 3 million fans (47,188
at today's game). Jay Blood is the historic 3 millionth spectator as Don
Sutton and the Dodgers shut out the Braves, 5-0. The victory is dampened
when coach Jim Gilliam suffers a brain hemorrhage.

Phil Garner hits his 2nd grand slam in 2 days as the Pirates beat the
Expos, 6-1. Garner is the first NL player to have slams in consecutive games
since Jimmy Sheckard (9/23, 24/01) and the first major leaguer since Brooks
Robinson, in 1962. Garner will end the season with 12 dingers.

The Sox score five runs in the 10th inning to top the Mariners, 8-3, and win
their first extra-inning game of the year. The Sox had lost their previous
eight. With the victory, Chicago avoids becoming the first team in history
not to win an extra-inning game.

The Yankees, now 1 1/2 games in front of Boston, open a 3-game series in
the Bronx with the Red Sox. Guidry again gives up 2 Boston hits and wins

off Luis Tiant, in the 4-run 4th inning.

over the Orioles. Watson, hitting in order (2nd inning single; 4th inning
double; 6th inning fielder's choice; 8th inning triple; 9th inning homer
to LF), becomes the first player to cycle in the both the AL and NL (having
done it with Houston in 1977).

At Los Angeles, the Reds' Dan Driessen hits a long drive to CF with 2 outs
in the 9th that bounces off the glove off Derrell Thomas and over the wall

Candelaria from the Angels for a pair of minor leaguers.

1988
n a 10-3 Twins win, Kirby Puckett collects his 1,000th hit, a double off

two hits short of Medwick's record of 1064.

1990

in college.

David Wells, the Orioles lose, 4-3, to Toronto. The Jays score 3 in the
bottom of the 9th on Kelly Gruber's homerun to make a winner of reliever

again in the same inning.

1991
Cardinals rookie Ray Lankford hits for the cycle in a 7-2 win over the Mets.

In Baltimore's 4-3 win over Cleveland, O's OF Joe Orsulak - he starts

enough to prevent the Redbirds' 7-6 loss to the Dodgers at Busch Stadium.

1996
Thanks to Andres Galarraga's three-run homer the Rockies establish a big
league record for runs scored at home. Colorado, which will amass 658 tallies

the 'Big Cat' goes deep to surpass the 1950 Red Sox who crossed the plate
625 times.

colon. Davis goes hitless in the contest, but rips a long fly out to deep
right-center in his first at-bat.

Jays. Junior has now hit 100 homers in a 2-year span, just the 6th major
leaguer to do so.

The Mets, 1-0 winners yesterday on a HR by diminutive Luis Lopez, use the
long ball today to tie the Phils. New York collects 4 HRs in the 7th and
8th to tie at 6 apiece, then hit 6 straight singles in the 10th to score

a 31-year-old rookie released by the Mets in the spring.

Beck in the 9th inning. The homer caps a 4-run rally for the 1st place Braves.

At least it's not the Duck Pond. Anaheim Stadium, the Big A, gets a new
name - Edison International Field of Anaheim. Edison, a utility giant,
will pay $50 million over 20 years for a package that includes the name of
the stadium, home to the Angels. The newly renovated, 30-year-old ballpark
will once again be a baseball-only facility.

1998
In a 12-7 win over the Twins, Mariner Ken Griffey Jr becomes the
fourth-youngest (28 years 10 months) player to reach 1,000 RBIs with his
52nd homerun. Junior got to the 1000 mark younger than anyone except Mel

well. The A's are one game in back of the Indians for the wild card.

2002
Defeating the Indians after a 67-minute rain delay, 5-0, the Twins clinch
the American League Central Division flag. Minnesota, which will be making

The Rangers defeat the Mariners, 6-4.

Thousands of Hanshin Tigers fans jump as off the Ebisubashi Bridge into the

to jump into the murky river when the team wins.

2004

after visiting the mound. It is the first in the majors in 5 years.

1936-45 Phillies are the only other team in big league history to accomplish
the infamous feat.

2007

record. His third-inning round tripper off Reds hurler Kirk Saarloos,
breaks the team's homerun mark set by Gorman Thomas (1979) and Richie Sexson
(2001, 2003).

Although it's nowhere near the amount Mark McGwire's 1998 single season
homerun record ball commanded, Giants slugger Barry Bonds' career No. 756
homerun baseball sells for more than experts predicted. The ball thrown
by Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik on August 7, which was auctioned by Matt
Murphy, the fan who caught the historic homer, is won by an unidentified
bidder for $752,467.

2008
The day after dropping a doubleheader to the Phillies, the Brewers fire
Ned Yost (457-502) ending the manager's six-year tenure which saw Milwaukee
develop from cellar dwellers into a contender in the National League Central

will try to stop the recent skid of 11 losses in 14 games and keep the
83-67 club in contention for the wild card.

2010
Derek Jeter, giving a performance worthy of an Oscar, is awarded first base
when the umpires determine the New York shortstop was hit by a pitch thrown
by Chad Qualls. Video replay of the at-bat clearly shows the fastball hit the
knob of the bat which prompts a national debate about the ethics demonstrated
by the usually squeaky-clean Yankees captain, who admitted after the 4-3
loss to Tampa that he pretended to get hit by the pitch to get on base.

The Cubs beat the Cardinals at Busch Stadium, 7-3, to complete their first
three-game sweep in St. Louis in more than twenty years. The victory marks

out the brooms in the Gateway City.

At Fenway Park, Jose Bautista establishes a new Blue Jay record for homeruns
in a season when he hits his 48th, a two-run blast on a 3-2 fastball thrown

than 16 times in a year, breaks the mark established by George Bell in 1987.

Detroit's Johnny Damon collects his 100th career triple against the Texas
Rangers. He becomes the 160th player to reach this mark.

2011
After hitting a first-inning two-run homer, singling in the second, and
stroking a leadoff double in the fifth, Pablo Sandoval hits for the cycle when
he drives a pitch that sails just beyond the outstretched glove of Colorado's
right fielder Carlos Gonzalez for a triple. 'Panda', a third baseman not
known for speed, becomes the 25th Giant player to accomplish the feat,
and the first since Fred Lewis did the deed in 2007, also at Coors Field.
