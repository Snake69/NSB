innings before the Colts' Dexter scores in the 17th on an error, hit batter,
force-out, and a single by "Pete" Childs, his fourth hit of the game. Each
pitcher gives up 8 singles. This will stand as the longest shutout ever by a
Cub pitcher. Hughes fans 13 in 17 frames. The 17 innings sets the ML record
for the longest game [at 60' 6"]. The record will be broken a number of times.

An AL record that still stands is set when Cleveland and Washington make
22 errors in a doubleheader, 16 by Cleveland. Washington wins both games,

11-2 and 14-13. The second game is called after 6 innings.

Brooklyn sweeps a pair from Pittsburgh, winning 9-4 and 7-3. Pitt pitcher
Lave Winham helps with 4 errors in game 1. This ties the NL record set in
1900, and no pitcher in the NL has done it since.

1904
The Reds sweep the Giants, winning 6-4 and 2-0, to stall the Giants'
clinching of the flag. The Reds rough up Mathewson in the opener and Jack
Harper scatters 5 hits for the shutout. New York has lost 3 in a row for

to move a half game behind the leading Highlanders, losers to Washington, 4-2.

At Chicago, the White Sox lose a pair to New York before 20,000, their
largest Friday afternoon crowd. Forty policemen are on hand to control the
crowds. Hal Chase has 22 putouts at 1B in the first game, a 6-3 win, tying
the ML record. New York takes game 2, 4-1, to move back into first place.

1907

Mathewson coasts to a 6-2 win. Fred Merkle makes his first appearance for
the Giants, playing 2B.

St. Louis. With 2 weeks to go, 3 1/2 games separate 4 teams.

and no walks, but the Pirates win, 2-1. Vic Willis goes one better, allowing
just 2 New York hits for the victory.

1909
Rest seems to have cured Walter Johnson's sore arm, as the Nats' ace shuts
out Detroit, 2-0, his first appearance since August 29th. He will finish the
season at 13-25, 10 of the losses coming in shutouts. Five of the shutout
losses were to the White Sox.

will be out the rest of the season. He is expected to play in the WS.

1914
The White Sox score in the 4th inning on a Walter Johnson wild pitch, one
of 4 that Johnson uncorks in the game. But he strikes out 12 batters in
13 innings as the Nats finally break through against Chicago's Red Faber
for a 6-1 win. The record book gives Johnson all 4 wild pitches in the
4th inning, but it appears that Eddie Collins, who opened with a single,
stole 2nd and advanced on a grounder to 3rd, scored the Pale Hose's only
tally on just one wild pitch.

win the opener, 9-7. In the nitecap, a 14-4 Pirates win, Cuyler has his
3rd 4 for 4 game in his last 4 outings. He clouts 2 homers to back Kremer's

a Ripley's Believe It or Not cartoon.

none at home. Only Babe Ruth will end up with more homers (24) on the road
this year. Goose is tied for 4th in the AL.

Behind Waite Hoyt's two-hitter, the Yankees bomb the White Sox, 14-0, to
retain their 3-game lead in the AL. Babe Ruth has a triple and hits his
44th homer. Al Simmons is 2nd with 19.

1927

"Fats" Fothergill extends his hitting streak to 20 games. Fothergill's streak
will end tomorrow but he will go 36 for 72 in the 20 games, a .500 average,
the same average he had during a 20-game hitting streak over 1926-27. The

The 22-year-old Paul is the fifth rookie in major league history to pitch a
no-hitter. Diz says:  "If'n Paul had told me he was gonna pitch a no-hitter,
I'd of throwed one, too." Dean has two hits, including a double, while
Ducky Medwick adds a double and a triple. The Cards are now three games
behind the Giants, who have 7 games left. St. Louis has 9 games left.

The Giants give Freddie Fitzsimmons his first run in 34 innings, and

farm accident.

In Brooklyn, the Dodgers keep a woozy Campanella on the bench, preferring to
rest him for the WS. Rookie Clem Labine ignores Dressen's orders to take a
full windup, preferring to pitch out of the stretch with the bases jammed

1954
In front of just 1,912 fans, a Yankee Stadium low, Yankees rookie Bob Grim
wins his 20th, a four-hit 3-1 win over Washington. Freshman Dean Stone
takes the loss. The victory gives the Yanks 101 wins, and makes Grim only
the 2nd Yankee rookie in history to win 20. His 20 wins in less than 200
innings (199) makes him the most efficient 20-game winner ever. The Yankees
will finish with 103 victories, just one under the ML record for 2nd place,
held by the 1909 Cubs and 1942 Dodgers. Due to arm troubles, the 24-year-old
right-hander will eventually be used exclusively in relief, being selected
for the All-Star team in that role for the American League squad in 1957.

includes grounding into his 32nd DP in the opener, breaking the major league
record set by Bobby Doerr in 1949 ... Jensen will lead the majors again in
1956-57. The mark will finally be topped by another Sox player, Jim Rice,
with 36 in 1984. In a ceremony preceding the game, Jensen receives a new car
from station WBZ, for winning the station's contest to decide the team's MVP.

1955

homer of the year as just 1,503 watch in Cincinnati.

20 base runners in losing to the Red Sox in Boston, 13-7. Three times they
leave the bases loaded. Against a favorite cousin Frank Sullivan, Mickey
Mantle has two singles and sends a 480-foot HR into the CF bleachers to
the right of the flagpole that hits the brick wall about a foot from the
top. It is one of the longest homeruns ever hit at Fenway. His 3 hits raise
his average to .353, 3 points behind Ted Williams, who collects two hits
today. Billy Klaus has 5 RBIs to lead the Sox.

.380, 13 points ahead of Mantle, who has a single and a walk before being
lifted for rest. Mickey Vernon also homers to back Russ Nixon's 12th win.

Gail Harris is the last player to hit a HR as a New York Giant, as they beat

innings before relief.

At Fenway Park, the Red Sox complete a three game sweep of the Senators,
all by 2-0 shutouts. The Boston winning pitchers are Tom Brewer, Frank
Sullivan and Ike Delock. Today's win was marred when Ted Williams, in a fit
of anger, flings his bat into the stands striking Joe Cronin's housekeeper,
Gladys Heffernan, in the face. She is not badly hurt, and Williams is
very apologetic. But AL President Will Harridge will fine Williams for the
bat-throwing incident.

1959
With an eight-inning 12-hit effort in the Braves' 8-6 victory over Pittsburgh
at Forbes Field, lefty Warren Spahn earns his 20th victory for the fourth
consecutive season and for the tenth time in his career. The southpaw will
compile 13 seasons with twenty or more wins during his 21-year Hall of Fame
tenure in the major leagues. This is Spahn's 266th NL victory to tie Eppa
Rixey of the Phils and Reds for the career high in wins by a lefthander. The

shutout over Art Mahaffey, launching a 10-game Phils' losing streak. Rookie
Chico Ruiz scores the only run when, with Frank Robinson at-bat, he steals

the harbinger of the season-ending collaspe which will see the team blow
a six-and-half game lead with 12 left to play.

1966
The players almost outnumber the fans at Wrigley Field, as the Cubs draw
just 440 for a game with the Reds. Chicago wins, 9-3, behind Ken Holtzman,

Pittsburgh's Dock Ellis pitches a complete game win over the Cubs, 5-1. Phil
Niekro allows 4 runs to take the loss. Cubs reliever Jophrey Brown goes
2 innings, allowing the other run, in his only ML appearance. His next

is eaten by a raptor. As noted by Scott Flatow, Brown tossed 2 no-hitters
in the minors, losing them both.

1969
In a 3-3 tie in the bottom of the tenth inning at Candlestick Park, LA's Pete
Mikkelsen quickly retires the first two Giants batters, but then is ordered
to intentionally walk Willie McCovey, who is 4 for 4 in the game. The Dodger
reliever proceeds to issue free passes to the next two hitters unintentionally
(Bonds and Henderson), loading the bases, and then loses the game when
shortstop Maury Wills boots pinch-hitter Jim Davenport's ground ball.

1970
The A's Vida Blue no-hits the Twins, 6-0, becoming the youngest pitcher to
perform the feat since Paul Dean, 36 years ago to the day. The only base
runner against Blue is Harmon Killebrew, who walks in the 4th inning. Bert
Campaneris, who helps Blue with a leaping catch on Mitterwald in the 5th,
adds a triple and a HR. An Oakland crowd of only 4,284 watches Blue's 2nd ML
start. Blue is the 11th rookie in baseball history to throw a no-hitter. The
