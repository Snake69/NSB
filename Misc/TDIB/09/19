Jimmy Outlaw - as the Indians beat Detroit, 2-0, and cut the Bengals'

accounts for all the scoring. Feller has now thrown 6 one-hitters.

A pigeon gets into play in Boston as the Red Sox sweep a pair from the A's,
winning 11-10 and 3-0. In game 1 Tommy McBride mistakes a pigeon for the

more wins in five of those seasons.

but the Braves will win tomorrow, beating the Reds, 7-0, behind Lew Burdette.

1956
Orioles catcher Tom Gastall dies as the plane he is piloting crashes into the

tied for 1st with the Dodgers, with the Braves just a game back.

after they win the opener, 8-4. Pinch hitter Norm Cash scores the decisive
run in game 2. Cash thus ends his year by grounding into no double plays,

Dick McAuliffe and Roger Repoz will duplicate this in 1968.

1961
The Giants clobber Warren Spahn for 4 homeruns, one of them a grand slam
by Willie Mays, and then rally in the 8th and 9th to top the Braves,
11-10. The two teams combine for 8 homeruns and 57 total bases, but the

sacks-full single in the 9th.

in the bottom of the 16th, Willie Davis singles, steals 2nd and takes 3rd
on a wild pitch. With rookie reliever Morrie Steevens making his first ML
appearance, Davis swipes home to give the Dodgers the 4-3 win. His steal of

swipe of home in a 1944 game. The Phils now lead by 5 1/2.

Juan Marichal wins his 19th and willie Mays hits his 44th HR as San Francisco

inning. Jose Santiago (10-4) wins for the 2nd time in 2 days. The loss
drops Detroit from 1st place down to 4th. Dave Boswell throws a 2-hitter
to give the Twins an 8-2 win over the Royals. Joel Horlen wins his 18th
game, a 3-0 blanking of the Angels, to leave the White Sox in 3rd place,
a half-game behind the co-leaders, Boston and the Twins.

1968
Denny McLain's 31st win is overshadowed by Mickey Mantle's 535th homer. McLain
allegedly calls C Jim Price out and tells him to inform Mantle he's throwing
the slugger nothing but fastballs. The HR gives Mantle undisputed hold of
3rd place on the all-time HR list. Mantle tips his cap to Denny as he rounds
3B. Pepitone, the next batter, signals where he would like the ball, and
McLain dusts him. The Tigers win the game, 6-2, the 12th straight complete
game for the Tigers staff.

Jim Hannan, and in the 7th frame, brother Tony wallops a solo shot off
Joe Grzenda. The Red Sox win, 11-3, after taking the first game, 7-3. The
brothers also homered in the same game on July 4. Billy will end the year
with 18 homeruns, while Tony will connect for 36. Frank Howard is frustrated

After leaving one runner on base yesterday in a 5-1 win, the formula comes up
short today as the White Sox lose, 2-0, to California's Andy Messersmith,
who bests Wilbur Wood. The two runners left on base in two consecutive
games ties the ML and AL records.

1972
In a 15-inning contest with Chicago, the A's set an extra-inning record by

Astros infielder Dave Campbell hits a first-inning two-run double against
San Diego right-hander Clay Kirby to snap a 0 for 45 drought, tying a
major league record set in 1909 by Bill Bergen, a catcher who played with
Brooklyn. 'Soup', who will become a respected national baseball broadcaster,

hitless streak with the Padres and another 21 at-bat hitless streak for
the Cardinals before hitting the two-bagger in his eighth at-bat with Houston.

The Angels down the Rangers, 6-2 and 9-4, at Arlington Stadium. Frank

Giants, 5-1.

the 7th, 3 on Richie Hebner's homerun, to win.

1976
Catfish Hunter notches his 200th career victory as the Yankees stop Milwaukee,
2-1. Since 1901, only Christy Mathewson and Pete Alexander have hit the 200
mark before their 31st birthday, but arm trouble will limit Catfish to 224
wins. He'll win 17 this year, after 5 straight 20-win seasons.

1977
With two singles in his first two at-bats, Ted Cox ties and then breaks

1978
During a 12-11 win over the Cubs, the Pirates' 38-year-old, lead-footed
Willie Stargell attempts to steal 2B. The Cubs' SS waits with the ball as
Stargell slides 10 feet short of the base, signaling "time-out." The Pirates
led, 11-2, in the 7th, but the Cubs rally and tie it in the 9th. Dave Parker
homers in 11th off Bruce Sutter to give the Bucs their 7th straight win and
30th in their last 38 since August 12. Besides his two homers, Parker adds

was last accomplished in 1941 by Ted Williams.

The Reds light up Jerry Reuss (17-6) for 8 runs in 2 innings, enroute to a
10-7 win over the Dodgers. Reuss serves up a grand slam to Johnny Bench, the
9th slam off him this year, a NL record. Garvey and Cey solo for the Dodgers.

1981
The Red Sox snap the Yankees' nine-game winning streak at Fenway Parking

the big inning and Molitor also has a HR.

Phillies 2B Joe Morgan celebrates his 40th birthday by going 4 for 5 with
2 homeruns in a 7-6 win over the Cubs. He will go 4 for 5 again tomorrow

birthday with a dinger ... Bob Thurman was the first, in 1957.

Denver (AA) beats Portland (PCL), 5-4, to give the Tidewater Tides (IL)

drives in his 100th run, but the Cardinals lose to the Phillies, 6-3.

At Yankee Stadium, Jimmy Key (13-6) pitches the Toronto Blue Jays to a
7-4 win over the New York Yankees. The pre-game Canadian anthem features
NY-Irish singer Mary O'Dowd who forgets the words to "O Canada" and sings off
key. Later, O'Dowd says she can do better and hopes for another invitation
when the Blue Jays come to town next season. "I've sung at Carnegie Hall,"
she said. "I'm not a baby. What happened should not have happened. But I've
never sung at a stadium. It was very overwhelming. I went blank." She said
she had called the Mayor of Toronto, Art Eggleton, to apologize.

1986
At Anaheim Stadium, White Sox pitcher Joe Cowley, who had been demoted to
the minors earlier in the season, pitches an ugly no-hitter against the
Angels. Cowley walks 7 batters and allows a sacrifice fly as Chicago wins,
7-1. For Cowley, this win is his high note, as he won't record another big
league victory, going 0-4 with the Phils in 1987.

1988

1989

with 4 hits, including a pair of homers, again from each side of the
plate. Caminiti has now hit a pair of homers, right and left-handed,
in 3 of his last 4 games. He's the only major leaguer to ever to do it
3 times in a month. Jody Reed has 4 hits and 4 runs for the Pads. Andres
Galarraga connects for his 30th homer, giving the Rockies 4 players with 30+
homers. This matches the 1977 Dodgers.

1997
Marlins C Charles Johnson ties Buddy Rosar's mark for consecutive games
without an error (117), but does make his only passed ball of the year,
as the Marlins defeat the Mets, 5-2. Johnson will finish the year with 124
games without an E.

Matt Williams must have an honest face, because he pulls the hidden ball
trick for the third time, nabbing rookie Jed Hansen, in the Indians' 6-2
win over the Royals in game 2. Williams uses the same ploy in all three
instances. He asks the runner if he would step away from the bag so that
he can brush off the dirt. The runners comply, and Williams slaps the tag
on. The Royals win the opener, 10-3.

The White Sox tie Boston, 4-4, at Fenway on Albert Belle's 9th-inning grand
slam, off Tom Gordon, then win in the 10th on Frank Thomas' single. The
Red Sox had tied the game in the bottom of the 9th on pinch homers by
Curtis Pride and Scott Hatteberg, both off Keith Foulke. Boston wastes
Butch Henry's 7 2/3 shutout innings, while Mike Sirotka's one run in 8
innings goes unrewarded. Nomar Garciaparra has a pair of doubles to break
Ted Williams' Red Sox rookie record for total bases. His total is 348 on
his way to 365. Oliva set the AL rookie record in 1964 with 374.

1998
Indian Manny Ramirez belts two homers (#44 and #45) to raise his five-game
total to eight becoming only the second player in history to do so. Frank

Kansas City.

In a 5-3 loss to the Angels at Edison International Field, Mariner shortstop
Alex Rodriguez hits his 40th homerun of the season, off Jack McDowell,
becoming the first infielder and third player in major league history to

1988) and Barry Bonds (Giants - 1996) are the other members of the 40-40 club.

Texas strikes 2 homerun marks today. Mike Simms of the Rangers hits his 16th
HR of the year to tie the major league mark for most HRs with less than 200
at-bats in a season. Eddie Robinson of the Yankees and Bob Thurman of the Reds
accomplished the feat in 1955 and 1957, respectively. Juan Gonzalez belts his
300th career homer, off Jimmy Haynes, but the Rangers lose to Oakland, 8-4.

Braves lefty Tom Glavine wins his 20th, shutting out Arizona, 5-0. The
victory gives the Braves their 2nd straight season of 100 wins, the first
team in 2 decades to accomplish that. The Phils of 1976-77 posted identical
101-61 marks.

The Giants score 7 runs in the 3rd inning, and 6 more in the 4th, as they
demolish the Dodgers by a score of 18-4. Bill Mueller and Jeff Kent bang

history that 2 players have hit grand slams in a game.

2000
A Dodger fan, in addition to other court-ordered restrictions, has been

The Pirates bash the Phillies, 12-8, scoring 9 runs in the 6th inning.

After a 16-3 loss to Toronto, New York manager Joe Torre has a team meeting,

In the Reds' 7-3 loss to the Giants, Ken Griffey pinch hits his 400th HR. He

Berger of the Boston Braves in 1930.

Roger Clemens wins his 20th game of the year against only 1 defeat, hurling

In only his second appearance in the Marlins' starting lineup, Cameron
Maybin equals a franchise record by getting on base in 10 consecutive

straight at-bats, which also ties a team record shared by Preston Wilson
and Gary Sheffield.

In Tampa Bay's 11-1 rout of Minnesota, Carlos Pena's fourth-inning homerun is

2010
Nationals Park hosts a simulcast of the Washington National Opera's
production of Verdi's dramatic musical play, 'The Masked Ball', as it is
