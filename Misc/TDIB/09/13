1901
The Baltimore Orioles edge the A's, 12-10. In the 9th, the A's have the
tying runs on base with 2 outs when Connie Mack sends up pinch hitter Doc
Powers to bat for Nap Lajoie, who was sulking and refused to hit. Powers
flies out to end the game.

1902
Tinker, Evers and Chance play their first game as a SS-2B-1B combo for
Chicago. Germany Schaefer is at 3B as Chicago clips St. Louis, 12-0. Tinker
starts a DP, but it goes to Evers and then to P Jock Menafee covering 1B.

Cleveland beats the St. Louis Browns twice, 4-1 and 2-1. In game 2, Nap
Lajoie strikes out against Willie Sudhoff, just the 6th time this year that
he's K'ed.

The Superbas top the Giants' Christy Mathewson, 7-2, with the help of 5
New York errors, three by 3B Bill Lauder.

1905
Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers engage in a fist fight on the field during an
exhibition game in Washington, IN, because Evers took a taxi to the park,
leaving his teammates in the hotel lobby. Allegedly, this is the incident
that will cause the pair to not speak to each other ever again. Years later
Evers will point to a hard throw from 10 feet away that bent his finger in
1907. When he complained to Tinker, he laughed, according to Evers.

The A's Eddie Plank outduels Boston's Jesse Tannehill to post his third
1-0 victory of the year.

1906
At St. Louis, Chicago tops the Cardinals, 6-2, as Mordecai "Three Finger"
Brown wins his 11th straight.

1907
At Washington Park, Mathewson tops Jim Pastorius, 2-1, striking out 11
Superbas batters. Dan McGann is 4 for 4 for New York, while teammate Jack
Hannifan collects a single, double, triple and two walks in his 5 at-bats.

Pittsburgh's Nick Maddox makes his ML debut and tosses a nifty 4-0 shutout
over the St. Louis Cards.

1908
Browns pitcher Rube Waddell gives up a Detroit run in the first when Ty
Cobb triples home Matty McIntyre, but ties the game when he singles a run
home in the 2nd. Waddell allows nothing after that and the Browns win, 2-1,
when Syd Smith singles in the winner in the bottom of the 11th.

An error by Pitt's Charlie Starr accounts for all three Reds' runs as the
Pirates lose, 3-2. The loss drops the Pirates to 3rd place.

On closing day of the Ohio State League, Walter "Smoke" Justis of Lancaster
pitches a 3-0 no-hitter against Marion. It's his fourth no-hitter of the
year. The others came July 19 (6-0) against Mansfield, August 2 (6-0)
against Portsmouth and September 8 (5-0) over Lima. Justis had no record
in 2 games for the 1905 Tigers.

1909
Ty Cobb clinches the AL HR title with his 9th round-tripper in a 10-2 Detroit
win over the Browns. It is an inside-the-park drive against the Browns. In
fact, all his 9 HRs this season are inside-the-park, including 2 on July
15th. He is the only player in this century to lead in HRs without hitting
one out of the park. Only Crawford (12 in 1901) has hit more inside-the-park
homers in a year than Cobb. The Georgia Peach will hit 117 round-trippers
during his 24-year career, but this is the only season he will lead the
league.

1910
The Giants split with the Pirates, winning 11-1, then getting outslugged,
15-3. Mathewson loses the opener, allowing 5 runs in 8 innings.

time he is more effective, stopping Detroit on 2 runs. Ruth hits his 49th
HR and Mays drives in the final run of a 4-2 win.

The Indians and Sox both win, the Tribe edging the A's, 3-2, and the Sox
mauling the Nats, 15-6.

1921
Walter Johnson wins the AL MVP with 55 out of a possible 64 votes.

1922
The Browns announce that George Sisler has severely strained ligaments and
cannot lift his right arm over his head. He might be out for the remainder
of the season jeopardizing the Browns' pennant chances and Sisler's 39-game
hitting streak. Ironically, the injury occurred when Sisler tried to catch
a throw on a hit by Ty Cobb, whose streak he is trying to break. Without
Sisler, the 2nd place Browns rally to beat the Tigers, 8-6. Jacobson,
playing 1B, makes 2 errors.

The Yankees split a pair with the host White Sox, losing 7-3 before winning
6-3. Ev Scott barely keeps his consecutive games played streak alive when
he is delayed because of a train wreck. Scott hires a car and arrives at
the ball park in the 7th inning of game 1.

Pittsburgh sweeps a pair from the visiting Braves, winning 8-1 and 6-1. Wilbur
Cooper and Johnny Morrison are the winners. Joe Genewich makes his ML debut
in relief for the Braves. Genewich jumped from the sandlots, where he was
making $5 a game pitching, directly to the Braves, bypassing the minors.

The powerful Baltimore Orioles win their 4th straight International League
pennant, sweeping a doubleheader from Newark, 6-3 and 15-10. Jack Bentley

(108-36) in Baltimore.

The Senators win 7-3 over Detroit, with Walter Johnson picking up the
victory. Harry Heilmann is 2 for 4 and scores a run for the Bengals.

The White Sox buy OF Maurice Archdeacon from Rochester (International League)
for $50,000. After batting .402 in 22 games, including two 5-hit games,
the little speed merchant will drop to .319, then to .111, then out of sight.

1924
Detroit's Emory Rigney hits a 7th-inning solo HR off Walter Johnson, but
the visiting Senators chug their way to a 6-4 win. Hours later, Johnson
receives word he's been elected AL MVP with 55 points. White Sox 2B Eddie
Collins is a distant 2nd. He was runner-up to Ruth last year.

1925
At Ebbets Field, Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance narrowly misses back-to-back
no-hitters over Philadelphia, pitching a 10-1 no-hitter 5 days after a 1-0
one-hitter. The Phils' lone run is scored by Chicken Hawks, who reaches 2B
on an error. Five days earlier it was Hawks' 2nd-inning single that ruined
Vance's no-hitter. On June 17, 1923, Vance lost a no-hitter with 2 outs in
the 9th. In the 2nd game the Phils win, 7-3, behind Chicken Hawks' grand slam.

Reds ace Pete Donohue wins his 20th, beating Chicago, 5-2, at Wrigley.

1927
Babe Ruth hits two HRs (51 & 52), and the Yankees win a pair by 5-3 scores
from Cleveland to clinch the AL pennant with a 98-41 record and 17-game
lead. It is Miller Huggins' 5th pennant, tying him with Connie Mack. Waite
Hoyt scatters 10 hits and wins his 20th in the nitecap. He will finish at
22-7, the only 20-game winner on the team.

1930
At Philley, the Phils knock the Cubs out of 1st place, winning 7-5. Game
2 is called in the 3rd inning because of rain. Left O'Doul's 2-run pinch
homer in the bottom of the 8th snaps a 5-5 tie.

Brooklyn beats the Reds, 4-3, for their 9th straight win. Brooklyn moves
ahead of the Cubs and is percentage points behind the Cards.

1931
Yankee Tony Lazzeri steals 2B, reaches 3B, then steals home in the 12th to
give Lefty Gomez a 2-1 win over Detroit in the lidlifter. New York edges
the Tigers, 4-3, in the nitecap although Earl Whitehill holds them to 6
hits. One of the hits is a 2-run HR by Gehrig in the 6th.

After the Giants lose, 1-0, to Larry Benton in the opener, Fat Freddie
Fitzsimmons pitches New York to a 9-4 nitecap win over the Reds. Bill Terry
contributes 2 doubles and 2 HRs in the win.

Cardinal P Paul Derringer has his scoreless inning streak stopped at 33,
but manages to beat the Phils, 6-2, on 6 hits.

At Wrigley, the Cubs win 11-7 over the Braves when player-manager Rogers
Hornsby cracks an 11th-inning pinch grand slam. According to historian David
Vincent, this is the first extra-inning pinch grand slam in ML history. The
Cubs take the second game, 8-1, behind Guy Bush's one-hitter, his 2nd of
the year. His first was against the Cards on August 9th.

1932
With their 100th victory of the year, the Yankees clinch the American
League pennant as George Pipqras beat the Indians at Cleveland Stadium,
9-3. Yankee Joe McCarthy, who captured a flag with the 1929 Cubs, becomes
the first manager to win pennants in both the American and National Leagues.

Brooklyn's Jack Quinn earns his 247th ML victory at age 49 pitching a
complete-game 6-5 win over the Cardinals. It is the final win of his
career. Dizzy Dean fans 9 in the nitecap, but the Cards lose, 3-1.

1933
White Sox veteran hurlers Sad Sam Jones (41) and Red Faber (44) are the
starting pitchers in a doubleheader split with the A's at Philadelphia's
Shibe Park. It will be another 53 seasons before another pair of 40+
year-old teammates (Yankees Tommy John and Joe Niekro) start both ends of
a twin bill. Sam Jones wins, 3-2, in the opener, but the Mackmen beat Red
Faber, 4-2, in the nitecap.

1934
New York's Lefty Gomez pitches a 3-hit 3-1 victory against the Indians for
his 25th win.

Judge Landis sells the WS broadcast rights to the Ford Motor Company for
$100,000. Previously no fee had been charged.

With his fiancee, Edna Mae Skinner of Oklahoma, watching, Schoolboy Rowe
halts the Tiger skid with a 2-0 win over Washington, his 23rd victory. He
asks in a radio interview:  "How'm I doing, Edna?"

In the opener of a critical four-game series at the Polo Grounds, Freddie
Fitzsimmons and Paul Dean throw 11 scoreless innings before the Cardinals
score 2 in the top of the 12th. Dean wins, 2-0. The Giants lead is cut to
4 1/2 games.

1935
Friday the 13th brings bad luck to the Cards at home. Trailing New York,
10-6, after the Giants score 4 in the 9th, the Cards tie it up and then
give the ball to Dizzy Dean. But the Giants score 3 in the 10th against
the tired star, to win 13-10. With a man on 1B, RF Pepper Martin provides a
fielding highlight by knocking down a line drive by Bill Terry, picking the
ball up and racing to 1B to tag Jackson and forcing Terry for an unassisted
DP. With the Cubs' win, the Giants' lead is 4 percentage points.

Larry French and the Cubs beat the Dodgers, 4-1, for their 10th straight
win. All 10 have been complete games. French allows 8 hits, 3 to Al Lopez.

The Reds' Whitey Hilcher tosses his only ML CG to beat Boston's Ed Brandt,
1-0. For the Braves it is their 14th straight loss.

Detroit wallops the Yankees, 13-5, behind Schoolboy Rowe. Greenberg has 3
hits including a homer to boost his league-leading average. George Selkirk
hits an inside-the-park homer and Lou Gehrig hits 2 out to reach 30 homers. He
now has 116 RBIs, 54 coming on homers.

1936
At Shibe Park, Bob Feller, still only 17, breaks the AL record and ties the
ML mark with 17 strikeouts, defeating the A's, 5-2. Feller gives up two hits
and walks two. Randy Gumpert, just 18, takes the loss. Cleveland also takes
game 2 winning, 5-4. After the season, Feller will return to his Van Meter,
Iowa home to graduate from high school.

The Cardinals and Giants split a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds before
64,417, the largest crowd in the 60-year history of the NL. It is estimated
that 50,000 fans are turned away, the gates having been closed 3 hours before
the start of the twinbill. Bill Terry's league leaders take the opener, 8-4,
then lose the nitecap, 4-3, to stay 3 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis. In the
lidlifter, Dick Bartell cracks a 2-run homer in the 1st and Mel Ott follows
with his 36th homer, then adds his 37th. In the nitecap, Dizzy Dean makes
his 3rd appearance in 2 days to save the win for Roy Parmalee. Diz threw
a complete game and relieved in game 2 at Brooklyn yesterday.

At St. Louis, the Yankees bomb the Browns with 8 homers, winning 10-7 and
13-1. DiMaggio hits 3 homers, Gehrig and Powell 2 apiece. The Yanks have
now hit 175, topping the AL record of 173 set by the 1932 A's.

1937
Manager Charlie Dressen presses Reds GM Warren Giles for a contract renewal
and is fired after 130 games of the season. Chief scout Bobby Wallace takes
over the last-place team on an interim basis. Wallace last managed the 1912
Browns. The 25 years in between manager jobs is the longest stretch in ML
history. Dressen will come close, not managing again until 1951.

1938
A special committee names Alexander Cartwright to Baseball's Hall of Fame
for originating the sport's basic concepts. Henry Chadwick, inventor of
the boxscore and the first baseball writer, is also honored.

1939
At Crosley Field, Reds P Junior Thompson shuts out the Dodgers, 3-0, on 2
hits, a single in the 2nd by Johnny Hudson and another in the 8th by Dixie
Walker. The Reds lead the Cardinals by 3 1/2 games.

1940
Tommie Bridges shuts out the Yankees, 8-0, for his 16th victory and Detroit's
8th win in 9 games. Greenberg hits his 33rd of the year.

The White Sox sweep a pair from the A's, winning 6-2 and 8-4. A's SS Al
Brancato helps Chicago by making 3 errors in one inning in the nitecap,
after making 2 errors in game 1.

1941
The Dodgers' Whit Wyatt beats the Cards' Mort Cooper, 1-0, in St. Louis
before 33,691, the largest paid attendance in St. Louis since June 18,
1927. Dixie Walker's double in the 8th is the first Dodger hit. Walker then
relays a stolen sign to Billy Herman, who singles him home. The Dodgers
again lead the NL by 2 games.

The beat goes on. Indians manager Peckinpaugh announces he has fined
and suspended Roy Weatherly for not hustling in the series with the
Senators. Weatherly will be paid off for the rest of the season and removed
from the roster, but he will be back with the Tribe next year.

1942
Chicago Cub SS Lennie Merullo makes a ML record 4 errors, all on consecutive
plays, in the 2nd inning of the nightcap against the Boston Braves. The
Cubs win, 12-8, after losing the first game, 11-6. Merullo, who made an
error in the opener, is comforted by his DP partner Lou Stringer, who made
4 errors in his ML debut a year ago. Merullo has a son born today and his
teammates suggest he nickname him "Boots."

In Philadelphia, the Cards blow a 1-0 lead in the 9th and lose, 2-1, then win
the 2nd game, 3-2. The Dodgers blow their opportunity by losing twice to the
Reds. Bobo Newsom, who had planned to pitch both games of the doubleheader,
loses the 1st game, 6-3. Durocher then went with Curt Davis in the 2nd game
and the Phils won again, 4-1. The Dodgers are now in 2nd place.

At Chicago, the Red Sox sweep a pair from the Pale Hose, winning 6-1 and
5-0. Bill Butland wins the opener on 4 hits, while Tex Hughson wins his
19th in game 2. Ted Williams homers in game 1, the 12th straight game in
which he's had a RBI, tying Joe Cronin's team record. Ted scores 2 in the
nitecap, but has no ribbies.

1945
Only 281 patrons are in attendance at Crosley Field to watch the hometown
Reds beat New York, 3-2. The Thursday crowd will be the smallest gathering
of fans during the 58-year history of the Cincinnati ballpark.

In his 1st start since returning from the Navy, Senator P Walt Masterson
shuts out the Indians on 2 hits. Masterson's win leaves the Senators just
a half-game behind Detroit.

1946
The Boston Red Sox clinch the AL pennant, edging the Cleveland Indians, 1-0,
on Ted Williams' inside-the-park HR, the only one of his career. Williams
lines the ball to left center over the shift when LF Pat Seerey pulls in
behind the SS position, and Ted outlegs Fat Pat who eventually runs the
ball down. Tex Hughson stops the Indians on 3 hits beating Red Embree,
who allows just two hits. The Boston margin at season's end will be 12 games.

It's the Dodgers turn as they score 4 runs in the 1st inning against Red
Munger and hold on to top the Cardinals, 4-3. The Dodgers now trail St. Louis
by 1 1/2 games.

1947
It is the Dodgers turn to win, 8-7, before 33,510, the largest crowd of the
year at Sportsman's Park. The game features 36 hits and extends the Dodgers'
lead to 5 1/2 games.

1948
In a 3-2 loss, Cleveland 32-year-old P Don Black (2-2) suffers a cerebral
hemorrhage while at-bat in the 2nd inning against the Browns. Black's life
will hang in the balance for a week. He recovers, but his pitching days
are over. Keltner sets a team mark with 10 assists at 3B.

1949
For the 2nd time in his career, Ralph Kiner hits HRs in 4 consecutive at-bats,
over 2 games. He performed the same feat in 1947. The 2 HRs today are numbers
33 and 34, and the first is a grand slam in the Pirates' 6-run first. He
has 4 hits altogether, good for 6 RBIs as Cliff Chambers beats the Phils,
11-6. Kiner's 1949 total will include 25 on the road, 29 at Forbes Field,
14 of them in the bullpen enclosure still known as Greenberg Gardens. Today's
grand slam, his 4th of the year, ties a ML mark held by 6 players.

Red Munger pitches the Cards to 1-0 win against the Giants in New York. He
faces 28 batters, with only a 2nd-inning single by Sid Gordon preventing
a no-hitter.

1950
Sal Maglie's string of scoreless innings ends at 45, but he beats the Pirates,
3-1, in a rain-shortened 7-inning game. Pirate Gus Bell's 257-foot fly ball
barely clears the RF wall at the Polo Grounds. For Maglie, it is his 11th
straight win.

1951
The Cards play a rare doubleheader - the first in the 20th century - with 2
different teams, defeating the Giants, 6-4, in the first game in the afternoon
when they score six runs against Sal Maglie in the 2nd inning. The Giants
contest is a makeup game. In the nitecap, against the Braves, the Cards
manage just one hit - by pitcher Al Brazle - in losing to Warren Spahn,
2-0. The Cards' total attendance is 8,865 - 4,160 for the Giants and 4,705
for the Braves.

Yankees leadoff hitter Mickey Mantle drives a Virgil Truck's pitch deep into
the RF upper deck to start the Yankee scoring. Witnesses say that if Mantle
had hit it more to CF, the ball would've traveled 600 feet. Mantle then K's
3 times, as Trucks drives over New York for a 9-2 Detroit win. Trucks adds
a pair of RBIs.

1952
Braves ace Warren Spahn strikes out 6 Pirates in a row enroute to an 8-0
win in Boston.

OF Frank Carswell of the Buffalo Bisons wins the International League batting
title with a .344 average. He also leads the league in HRs with 30 and has
101 RBIs.

the sacks full. Sullivan is the winner in relief of Parnell. Red Sox C
Sammy White makes an unassisted DP.

P Bob Trice becomes the first black to appear in a ML game for the
Philadelphia Athletics, but his debut is spoiled by the Browns, winners
5-2 in the opener of 2. The former Homestead Grays hurler goes 8 innings,
giving up 5 runs on 8 hits in losing to Don Larsen. Larsen helps with a
homer. Harry Byrd (11-19) wins the nitecap for the A's, 2-0, his first
win after 9 straight defeats. Trice will pitch only in three games for
Philadelphia this season and 19 next year and few more in 1956.

1954
Redlegs slugger Ted Kluszewski scores a run in a 6-5 loss to the Pirates. Big
Klu has scored in 17 consecutive games, scoring 24 runs, tying the ML record
of 17 straight games set by Rogers Hornsby in 1921. (This earlier mark was
discovered in 2003 by researcher Trent McCotter.) Tomorrow Brooklyn's Johnny
Podres will shut the Reds out, 4-0.

1956
Mantle breaks out of a September slump with two hits, including a homer,
as New York beats Tom Gorman and the A's, 3-2.

In both ends of a doubleheader, Hank Aaron has the game-winning hit as
the Braves sweep a pair from the Phillies, 3-2 in 13 innings and 4-3 in
12 innings. Warren Spahn is the winner in the nitecap, his 200th career
victory. The sweep moves Milwaukee 2 games ahead of Brooklyn and 3 games
up on Cincinnati.

1958
The Braves' Warren Spahn becomes the first lefty to win 20 or more games 9
times as he beats St. Louis, 8-2. Eddie Plank and Lefty Grove each won 20
games 8 times.

1959
Glen Hobbie of the Cubs stops Ken Boyer's hitting streak at 29 games. He
was 41 for 117 for a .350 mark over the course of his streak. Hobbie allows
just 4 hits in shutting out the Cards, 8-0.

The Indians lose a doubleheader to New York, 2-1 and 1-0. Mantle wins the
opener with a 2-run 11th-inning homer, his 29th of the year. In the nitecap,
Duke Maas outpitches Jim Perry. The 2 losses push the Tribe to 5 1/2 games
behind leading Chicago, which wins today.

1960
At Crosley Field, Eighteen-year-old OF Danny Murphy becomes the youngest
Cub to hit a HR when he clouts a 3-run homer off Bob Purkey, but the Reds
win 8-6 in Cincinnati. Murphy will play just 49 games for the Cubs from 1960
to 1962. He will come back as a pitcher for the White Sox in 1969 and 1970.

Nellie Fox hits a 2-out HR in the 11th to give the visiting White Sox a
6-5 win over the Senators. It is Nellie's 2nd HR of the year.

1962
Washington OF Jim Piersall is arrested for going into the stands after a
heckling fan prior to a game against Baltimore. He is charged with disorderly
conduct, but later cleared. Hicks replaces Jimmy in the 7-1 loss to the
Orioles. O's winning pitcher Chuck Estrada clouts one of the 3 Birds homers.

In Kansas City's 5-4 win over the Angels, 17-year-old Ed Kirkpatrick pinch
hits in the 9th for LA. He is the youngest player in the AL since Jim
Derrington, in 1956, and no one younger will debut this century in the AL.

1963
The Dodgers split in Philadelphia and lead the Cards by 2 1/2 games. Chris
Short tops Sandy Koufax, 3-2, in the opener, before Ron Perranoski wins
the nitecap, 2-1.

1964
St. Louis becomes the first NL club to score in each inning since the
Giants did it on June 1, 1923. They coast, 15-2, at Wrigley Field with
Curt Simmons improving his record to 15-9. Dick Ellsworth goes to 14-15 for
Chicago. Julian Javier, Lou Brock and Mike Shannon homer for the Birds. A
dropped pop-up in the top of the ninth secures St. Louis' place in history.

1965
At the Astrodome facing Don Nottebart, Giant outfielder Willie Mays becomes
the fifth player in major league history to hit 500 career homeruns. The
'Say Hey Kid' will hit a league-leading and career high 52 homeruns enroute
to his second MVP season. Juan Marichal wins his 22nd. The win is the Giants
11th straight and gives them a 2 1/2 game lead.

1968
Jerry Koosman ties the National League rookie record when he hurls his
seventh shutout of season, blanking Pittsburgh on just three singles. The
left-hander's 2-0 victory, the Mets' 67th win of the season - a franchise
high, equals the mark shared by Irving Young (Braves, 1905) and Grover
Cleveland Alexander (Phillies, 1911).

1969
In a 6-4 defeat to the Reds, Bobby Bonds becomes the fourth player in major
league history to steal at least 30 bases and hit at least thirty homeruns
in the same season. The other members of the 30/30 club include Ken Williams
(1922 - Browns), Willie Mays (1956 & 1957 - Giants) and Hank Aaron (1963 -
Braves). Bonds' 32nd steal, on August 13th, erased Willie Mays' SF record
of 31.

Houston's Larry Dierker and Atlanta's Phil Neikro match gooseggs into extra
innings before Phil leaves after 11 and Larry after 12. Dierker takes a
no-hitter into the 9th inning only to lose his bid on Felix Milan's two-out
single. In the 13th, the Braves score a pair of runs and the Astros answer
with three off Fred Gladding to win, 3-2.

Detroit is eliminated when they lose to the Senators, 11-6. The Nats score
5 in the 5th, 3 coming home on a Ken McMullen homer, one of his 4 hits in
the game. Detroit rallies in the 6th on Willie Horton's 3rd grand slam of
the year, but McMullen knocks home another 2 runs to give Darryl Knowles
(7-3) the win over Bob Timmerman.

Baltimore becomes the AL East champs when Tom Phoebus wins the clincher,
10-5, over Cleveland. Baltimore is 18 games ahead of Detroit with 17 to play.

1970
At Wrigley, the Pirates lead the Cubs, 2-1, with 2 outs and none on in the
9th when Willie Smith hits a routine fly to Matty Alou. Alou drops it and
three singles later the Cubs have a 3-2 win. The victory puts the Cubs a
game behind the Bucs and a half-game behind the Mets.

Kansas City sweeps a pair from Oakland, winning both by 8-7 scores. In the
11-inning opener, A's SS Bert Campanaris sets an AL record by participating
in 6 DPs. It will be tied in the NL.

1971
Frank Robinson of the Orioles homers in each game of a doubleheader split
with Detroit, becoming the 11th member of the 500-HR club with his 2nd
shot. The O's win the opener, 9-1, behind Dave McNally's 13th consecutive
win. The Tigers use 17 hits to win the nitecap, 10-5, for Scherman, who
pitches 8 2/3 innings in relief of Joe Niekro.

1972
Frank Howard, who is not playing regularly for the Tigers, hits a 3-run
homer off Dave McNally of the Orioles for a Detroit victory. It is his
13th career four-bagger off his favorite pitcher. He had hit one with the
Rangers on July 18th, and 11 with the Senators in 1965-1971.

The Reds' Johnny Bench hits a 2-run homer in the bottom of the 10th to beat
the Braves, 8-6. He hit a grand slam yesterday in a 7-5 win over Atlanta,
and he'll have 11 homers and 33 ribbies for September.

1973
During an 8-6 win over the Padres, the Giants' Tito Fuentes ties a ML record
by being hit by pitches 3 times.

1974
The Phillies set an NL record by using 27 players during a 17-inning 7-3
loss to the Cardinals. The Cards had set the record 2 days earlier.

With 16 games remaining, the enigmatic Dick Allen of the White Sox announces
he is quitting the team. His 32 HRs, the last of which was hit August 16th,
