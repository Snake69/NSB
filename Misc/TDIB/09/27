NL pennant. Except for a few hours on July 4, the Pirates have been in 1st
place since June 15.

At Philadelphia, the A's beat Cleveland, 14-6, behind Snake Wiltse. Nap
Lajoie has 3 hits including his AL-leading 14th HR, off Bracken.

1904

pitches the 4th no-hitter of the season. The White Sox have 26 official
at-bats against him in the 2-0 Boston win, their first loss to Boston after
10 straight wins. Chicago gets revenge in the nitecap, whipping the Americans,
15-1. Dinneen's no-hitter is the 2nd that Boston pitchers have thrown against
the White Sox in successive years ... it is the only time this century that
will occur. With the A's losing yesterday to the Tigers, Chicago now heads
for Philadelphia, trailing by 3 percentage points. The Boston Americans will
play 11 twinbills this month winning 2, losing 2 and splitting 7. Dinneen,
who will become an American League ump 17 days after he retires in 1909,
is the only person in major league history ever to pitch a no-hitter and
call one as a plate umpire.

Washington's Tom Hughes shuts out Cleveland, 6-0, his ML record 5th whitewash
over the Naps this year. His mark will be tied twice in the NL, by Alexander
in 1916 and Larry Jaster in 1966.

1907
After leading the AL most of the month, the Athletics (83-54) are beset by
pitching problems as Detroit (86-56) comes into Philadelphia for a 3 game

1908
At Detroit, the Tigers take over first place with a Sunday 5-2 win over
the A's behind righty George Mullin. Ty Cobb swipes home in the 3rd inning
with Jack Coombs on the mound and Mike Powers catching. He did it in the
1st inning on Thursday to the same pair in a 4-4 tie. All three steals of
home this season for Cobb have come on the front end of a double steal.

Ed Walsh blanks the Red Sox, 3-0 for a Chicago win. Only 4 percentage points
separate the top three AL teams.

In the 3rd inning of game 1, the Reds' Hans Lobert steals 2B, 3B and
home against St. Louis. But the Cardinals win, 7-4, before losing game 2,

1909
The first-place Pirates set an NL record with their 16th victory in a row,
before the Giants stop them, 8-7, in the 2nd game of a doubleheader.

1910
At Detroit, the Yankees win, 10-2, as rookie Russ Ford (26-6) records his
26th victory, beating Ed Willett. Ford's 26 is the most wins ever by a rookie.

1912
Eddie Plank goes 19 innings for the A's against Bob Groom and Walter Johnson
of the Senators, and takes a 5-4 loss when Eddie Collins' wild throw lets

1914
At St. Louis, the Athletics clinch the AL pennant behind Chief Bender's
6-0 shutout as the Red Sox split a doubleheader. Bender allows 4 hits, two
by Gus Williams, and he strikes out 5. Williams will end the year with 120
strikeouts, the first batter to K more than 100 since Same Wise set the ML
record in 1884 with 104.

In the opener of a doubleheader in Cleveland, Nap Lajoie collects his
3,000th hit as his Cleveland team defeats the Yankees, 5-3. Lajoie is 2
for 2 with two doubles. He is given the ball after his double. The star
is not expected to play the rest of the year. He does not play in game 2,
which the Yankees win, 5-2. Lajoie is the second modern major leaguer to
reach the 3000-hit milestone.

At Detroit, CF Ty Cobb misplays a bases-loaded single in the 10th by Ray
Morgan and four runs score. The Senators win, 6-2.

After losing four in Boston, the Cubs play an exhibition game against the
Providence Grays and lose again, 8-7 in 8 innings. The Cubs score 3 in the
9th to tie and when Providence tallies a run, the Cubs rush to make a train
... which they miss. The game at Rocky Point features two splash homers hit
into Narragansett bay, one by Wilbur Good and another by Grays pitcher Babe
Ruth. Ruth adds a triple and on the slab he walks 7 and strikes out 3. The
Cubs pocket $400 for their showdown with the Babe.

1915

beat St. Louis, 8-4.

1917
The Red Sox play a benefit game against an AL all-star team and Babe Ruth
and Rube Foster combine for a 2-0 shutout. The AL squad features Cobb,
Speaker and Jackson in the outfield. More than $14,000 is raised for the
family of sports writer Tim Murnane, who died February 13th. Murnane had
played and managed in Boston in the 19th century. Actress Fanny Brice
helps sell programs and former heavyweight champ John L. Sullivan coaches
3B for the Sox. Ruth wins the fungo hitting contest with a drive of 402
feet, while Joe Jackson has the longest throw at an impressive 396'8".
Duffy Lewis is second and Tilly Walker is third. Ray Chapman circles the
bases in 14 seconds flat to win a loving cup.

1919
Despite a Ruthian blast in game 1, the Senators sweep a pair from Boston,
7-3 and 3-1, handing both defeats to Reb Russell. Russell starts both
games, but is relieved in the opener before coming back for the CG loss in
game 2. Ruth's 29th HR is off Rip Jordan and is his first of the year in
Washington. It clears the 45-foot wall in RF, the longest ever seen there. He
is the first to homer in every park in the league in one season. Ruth's
homer is his last hit for Boston as he sits in game 2 and tomorrow, ending
the season with 29 of the 33 homers the Red Sox total.

1920
An article appearing in the Philadelphia North American quotes local gambler
Bill Maharg saying he and former major league pitcher Billy Burns offered
eight White Sox players $100,000 to throw the 1919 World Series. The team
will become infamously known as the Black Sox. At Chicago's Comiskey Park,
33-year-old Joe Jackson's sixth-inning double off Tiger hurler George Haus
breaks a scoreless tie putting the White Sox ahead, 2-0. 'Shoeless' Joe's
game-winning hit will be his last of his 13-year career as players put on the
grand jury list are indefinitely suspended for the rest of the season as the
probe of the 1919 World Series fix is investigated. Dickie Kerr gets the win.

The Indians continue on their warpath by topping the Browns, 8-4. Duster
Mails wins his 6th straight and Tris Speaker breaks out of a slump by
collecting 2 hits. He had been 1 for 19. Charlie Jamieson adds four hits.

At the Polo Grounds, the Braves eliminate the 2nd-place Giants in game 2
by a 3-2 score on Boeckel's homer in the 9th. The Giants win the opener,
2-1. The loss cinches the pennant for Brooklyn.

Carl Mays and the Yankees beat the A's, 3-0, as Mays allows just 4 hits. It
is his 3rd straight shutout over Philadelphia and his 10th straight win
against them. Babe Ruth drives in all the runs on a pair of homers over
the RF fence off Rommel, his 52nd and 53rd homers of the campaign. He hit
2 other liners to left and center that were close to the wall.

1921
The Browns' Urban Shocker stops the Yanks, 2-0, racking up his 5th win in
9 decisions against NY this year. It is his 27th win of the year.

In the first of 2 at Boston, Braves C Ray Powell hits 3 triples, tying the
ML mark, in an 8-5 win over Brooklyn. Dana Fillingim is the winner over
Burleigh Grimes.

1922
In the Giants' 3-2 win over the Phils, rookie Travis Jackson debuts, going
0 for 2. Jackson will play 15 years for the Giants, eventually going to
the Hall of Fame.

1923
Signed in June for a $1,500 bonus, and recently brought up from Hartford
(Eastern League), Lou Gehrig hits the first of his 493 HRs. It comes off
Bill Piercy at Fenway Park in an 8-3 New York win.

Red Sox owner Bob Quinn announces that Frank Chance will not manage the
team next year.

The International League fare well in exhibition games as Baltimore beats
the New York Giants, 4-3, behind Lefty Grove. Reading and the Philadelphia
Athletics battle to a 12-inning 6-6 tie.

1924
Behind Jack Bentley's 4-hitter the Giants clinch their 4th straight pennant,
beating the Phils 5-1, while Brooklyn loses, 3-2, to Boston.

Down 4-0 in the first, the Senators rally to top the Red Sox, 7-5, as the
Fenway crowd of 20,000 cheers the Washington win. Rookie pinch hitter Wade
Lefler, who had one at-bat with the Braves previously, drives in 3 runs with
a bases loaded double to win it. Lefler drove in Washington's only run in
Friday's loss, but his five games with Washington (5 for 9 with 3 doubles)
and one with Boston will sum up his ML career. In Philadelphia, the A's
beat the Yankees, 4-3, to give the Senators a 2-game lead with 2 to play.

Rookie Pedro Dibut (3-0) hurls the Reds to a 10-1 win over the
Cardinals. Except for a brief relief appearance next year, that's it in the
majors for the chunky Cuban, who played in the Negro Leagues for the Cuban
Giants (West) before the Reds. He sets an oft-tied NL record for most wins
without a loss in a career, a mark that will be eclipsed by Ben Shields
(4-0 in 2 leagues).

1925
In a doubleheader split with the Braves in St. Louis, the Cards player-manager
Rogers Hornsby hits his 38th and 39th HRs of the year, along with a single,
double and triple to push his average to .403. In batting practice tomorrow,
Hornsby will foul a ball off his foot splitting his toenail, and will sit the
last three games. The Rajah calls reporters into the club house to view his
bloody toe, "because some of those in the East may say I'm stallin' because I
want to save my .400 average." Hornsby will be the only player-manager to win
the triple crown, which he does by topping .400 for the 3rd time in 4 years,
while his 39 HRs and 143 RBIs are NL highs. His .756 slugging average is
still the NL's best for the 20th century. The Cards take the opener, 6-5,
and lose the nitecap, 7-6.

1926
Cleveland 1B George Burns hits his 64th double of the year, as the Indians
down Philadelphia, 5-4. Indians right-hander George Uhle gives up 9 hits
in winning his 27th against 11 losses. He leads the AL, despite giving up
a league-high 300 hits and 118 walks, and posts a 2.83 ERA. It is his best
record in a 17-year 200-win career.

1927
Babe Ruth connects for a grand slam off Lefty Grove while Lou Gehrig hits
No. 46 in a 7-4 win over the A's. For Ruth it is his 6th grand slam, but
just his 3rd as a Yankee. Ruth has 57 with 3 games to play.

1928
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants unveil bronze tablets in memory of former
players Christy Mathewson and Ross Youngs. The future Hall of Famers were
much beloved and respected by their manager John McGraw, a tyrant in the
dugout who was known to berate his ballplayers. With the Giants just a half
game behind the Cardinals, New York loses the 1st game of a doubleheader
to the Cubs, 3-2. On a controversial play at the plate in the 6th inning,
New York's Shanty Hogan hits a ball back to P Art Nehf who throws to third
to get the runner. But the runner Andy Reese was off with the crack of the
bat and bowls over C Gabbie Hartnett. Hartnett grabs the runner to keep
from falling, and as Hartnett holds him, Reese is tagged out by the Cubs
3B. The Giants bench erupts, but umpire Bill Klem rules Reese is out. The
subsequent protest will be disallowed, despite a photo clearly showing
Hartnett up the line holding Reese. The Giants win the nitecap, 2-0, but
a loss tomorrow clinches the pennant for St. Louis. McGraw will maintain
that Klem's call cost the Giants the pennant.

At Boston, the Cardinals erupt for 7 runs in the 15th inning to win, 10-3,
handing the loss to starter Bob Smith. Smith goes 14 1/3 innings allowing 9
hits and 12 walks. Smith and Kent Greenfield allow the 7 runs, a ML record
for the 15th inning. The Cards tied the game in the 9th on Andy High's
2-out 2-run single.

For a remarkable 2nd time in five weeks, Lefty Grove strikes out three batters
on 9 pitches, this time victimizing the White Sox (Berg, Thomas and Mostil)
in the 7th inning. Grove also starts the A's scoring with a solo HR and wins,
6-3, his 6th straight win over Chicago and his 24th of the year. Not until
Jim Bunning, in 1959, will another AL hurler K the side on 9 pitches. Grove
is the first pitcher to strike out the side on nine pitches for the second
time in his career. The A's southpaw is also the only hurler to do it twice
in one season.

At St. Louis, Bump Hadley pitches the Senators to a 6-5 win over the
Browns. Goslin, leading the AL, is 2 for 4, while his rival Heinie Manush
has one hit, a 3-run HR, in the Browns 5-run 9th. Manush has 13 homers -
all at home.

1929
In the Phils' 11-5 win over Boston, Chuck Klein hits HR No. 42, tying Mel
Ott and equaling Hornsby's NL record, and Lefty O'Doul collects 3 hits to
virtually wrap up the hitting title. Klein adds a double for the Phils,
who will sweep the Braves, following a sweep of the Robins.

1930
In a 13-8 victory over the Reds at Wrigley Field, Hack Wilson hits two
homeruns (off Eppa Rixey) establishing a new National League mark for
homers. The Cub outfielder's total of 56 for the season will stand until
Mark McGwire breaks the record in 1998. Gabby Hartnett adds two homers of
his own to help Pat Malone win his 20th victory.

At Ebbets Field, the Robins and Braves divide a pair, with Brooklyn taking
the opener, 8-2, behind Dazzy Vance. Vance fans 12. Almost overlooked in
game 2 is Wally Berger's 38th HR for the Braves, as Boston tops Brooklyn
7-1. It is a record for rookies and still stands as an NL record.

At Detroit, the Tigers split a pair with the White Sox, coming from behind
to win the opener, 6-5, and losing the nitecap, 10-5, behind the pitching of
infielder Mark Koenig. The Sox rattle Koenig for 10 hits and 10 runs before
he takes over for McManus at 3B in the 7th inning. This will be Koenig's
only ML decision, though he will make three more mound appearances for the
Bengals in 1931.

1931
Nick Altrock becomes the first player to appear in major league games in
five different decades. The 54-year-old former left-hander accomplishes
the feat as a pinch hitter when he walks and then is promptly picked off
first base in the Senators' 4-2 loss to Boston at Griffith Stadium.

Lou Gehrig hits a HR to tie Babe Ruth at 46 while the Yankees pound Lefty
Grove, 13-1, and deny him his 32nd victory. Grove throws just 3 innings in
the warm-up for the Series. Gehrig drives in 2 runs as he (184) and Ruth
(163) combine to drive in 347 runs for the year, the most productive duo
in history. Dickey has 4 hits and ends the year with no passed balls, the
only AL catcher - and the Yankees are the only AL team - to ever accomplish
the feat. The Yankees score 1,067 runs this season, the highest number
this century.

The most desperately contested battle for individual honors takes place in
the race for the NL batting title. Chick Hafey, who reported late due to
a contract dispute, goes into the final doubleheader with the Reds batting
.353, 4 points over Bill Terry, last year's champ. Hafey gets only 2 hits in
8 times at-bat to drop to .349. Bill Terry's Giants are playing arch-enemy
Brooklyn at Ebbets Field. Brooklyn, in their last game as the Robins, wins
12-3, behind Clark. Terry gets only one hit in 4 times at-bat. The title
goes to Hafey, who batted .3488 to Terry's .3486. Jim Bottomley, Hafey's
Cardinal teammate, goes 4 for 8 and finishes at .3481. The Cards win,
6-2 and 5-3, to win 20 of 22 with the Reds.

In a scheduled doubleheader at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers beat the Giants,
12-3, in the opener. The nitecap, called on account of darkness after three
innings with no score, will turn out to be the final contest between managers
Wilbert Robinson and John McGraw, one-time friends and business partners,
but now bitter enemies. McGraw has the edge, 197-190, with 5 ties.

1934
Despite being outhit 13-7, the Cards close to one-half game of the idle
Giants, beating the Reds, 8-5. Cincinnati SS Gordon Slade helps by making
3 errors in the first inning when the Birds plate 5.

1935
In his only major league game, Pirates rookie Aubrey Epps goes 3 for 4
in the Bucs' 9-6 loss at Cincinnati. The 23-year-old catcher will finish
his one-game major league career with the same batting average (.750)
and fielding percentage when he commits two errors in eight chances.

The Cubs clinch the NL pennant in the first game of a doubleheader with the
Cardinals, 6-2, besting Dizzy Dean, as Bill Lee wins his 20th. The Cubs tally
15 hits off Diz, led by Freddie Lindstrom's 4. With Roy Henshaw's victory,
5-3, in the nitecap, the Cubs extend their win streak to an incredible 21
games and reach the 100-win mark. Only once during the winning streak have
the Cubs pitchers given up more than 3 runs. The streak ties the franchise
mark set in 1880.

All AL games are rained out.

1936
When Johnny Mize is thrown out in the 7th inning for arguing, rookie 1B
Walt Alston subs. In his only ML game, the future Hall of Fame manager
makes one error in two chances and is fanned by Lon Warneke in his only
at-bat. St. Louis loses to the Cubs, 6-3, and the two teams end tied for
2nd place. Alston will win seven pennants and four World Series in his
23-year career as Dodger manager from 1954 to 1976.

The Yankees (102-51) end their season with a 10-5 loss to the Senators,
but finish in 1st place 19 1/2 games in front of the Tigers. Pete Appleton
relieves Buck Newsom in the 6th and pitches hitless relief for the win. Lou
Gehirg goes 0 for 2 and then watches the rest of the game in civilian clothes
behind the Washington dugout. The Yankees set a ML record with 992 RBIs for
the season. Their 1065 runs scored is 2 off the ML record they set in 1931.

The Boston Red Sox release Heinie Manush, and make Bing Miller a 3B coach
to replace Al Schacht, who announces he will begin to barnstorm as the
"Clown Prince of Baseball." Manush will sign with the Dodgers.

1937
At the Polo Grounds, Bill Lohrman stops the Bees in game 2, 3-1, to give
the Giants a sweep of Boston. With the double win, the Giants increase
their lead over the Cubs to 4 1/2 games.

The Cubs top the Reds, 7-4, behind Curt Davis, but drop further back. The
Reds use four pinch hitters in the 9th and they go 1 for 4.

Red Sox pitcher Buck Newsom attempts to pitch both games today against the
A's. He wins the opener, 6-2, then is knocked out in the A's 5-run 3rd of
game 2, and loses. the A's win 6-0 in 6 frames.

Chuck Klein belts two homers and a double as the Phillies hand the doddering
Dodgers their 12th straight loss, 11-3. Claude Passeau collects two hits
and scores twice to gain the complete-game win.

1938
An ailing Lou Gehrig hits his 493rd (29th this season) and final major
league homerun off Senators right-hander Dutch Leonard. On the same date
15 years earlier, the Yankee first baseman had gone deep off Bill Piercy
at Fenway Park for his first career homerun. New York wins today, 5-2.

For the 11th time, Hank Greenberg hits two homers, # 57 and 58, in the nitecap
of a doubleheader sweep of the Browns. His first HR was inside-the-park,
though he later admits he was "out by a mile" as Brownie catcher Sam
Hushaney seemingly nabs him. A friendly call by ump Bill McGowan saves
the homer. The Tigers win, 5-4 and 10-2, with the second game going just
5 innings. Although five games remain, Greenberg will hit no more and end
two short of Ruth's record.

With the Pirates 1 1/2 games up on the Cubs, Dizzy Dean stops the Bucs
for 8 innings with his "nothing ball." In the 9th Bill Lee, who pitched
a complete-game win against the Cards yesterday, relieves Dean (7-1),
and the Cubs hold on to win, 2-1. The Pirate lead is down to a half-game.

Bob Feller and the Indians beat the White Sox, 6-1. Rapid Robert also
reaches 201 bases on balls for the season, the first ML pitcher ever to
top 200 passes. Ryan will be the next and only one.

1939
The hometown White Sox play the first "day-night" doubleheader against
Cleveland, but lose both games, 5-2 and 7-5. Fans are charged separate
admissions for each game. For just the 2nd time this century, visitors
sweep more doubleheaders than the home team; 58 sweeps for the visitors,
47 for the home team. RetroSheet stats by Dave Smith will show that the
first season this occurred was 1923; 1962 will be the last.

1940
Besides Bobo Newsom (21-5), Schoolboy Rowe (16-3) and Tommy Bridges (12-9),
the Tigers pitching staff combines for a losing record. Needing one victory
to gain the title, manager Del Baker decides to withhold Newsom and Rowe
and picks 30-year-old rookie Floyd Giebell. Giebell shuts out the Indians,
2-0, to beat Bob Feller, who gives up just 3 hits, including a wind-blown
two-run homer by Rudy York down the LF line. The ball would likely have
been caught at League Park. Not eligible for the WS, Giebell never wins
another game in the majors. During the game, unruly Cleveland fans shower
the field with fruit and vegetables delaying the game. Greenberg is hit by
a tomato while on the field. At one point, a basket of green tomatoes is
dropped onto Tigers C Birdie Tebbetts' head while he sits in the bullpen,
knocking him out for a few moments. When Birdie recovers, he finds the
unruly fan, now in the hands of the police, and punches him.

In Pittsburgh's 4-3 win at Cincinnati, Lonny Frey, Reds infielder, breaks
his right foot in the dugout when the heavy metal cover of a water cooler
falls and lands on it. Frey will miss the WS.

In New York, the Yankees, winners of 8 straight games, lose to the A's Johnny
Babich, 6-2. Babich is a former Yankee minor leaguer. New York is out of
the World Series for the 1st time since 1935. Yankee C Arndt Jorgens, on
the club's active roster both last year and this, end the season without an
appearance, certainly a ML record. Last season he scored a run as a pinch
runner, but had no at-bats.

The Red Sox pound the Senators, 24-4, at Fenway, scoring 10 runs in the 4th
and 7 runs in the 8th. Boston bangs out 22 hits to make Fritz Ostermueller
the winner. Dom D scores 5 runs and Williams drives in 4.

Hugh Mulcahy ends the last-place Phillies twelve-game losing streak and his
personal 12-game win streak with a 6-0 whitewash of the Giants. Despite
the win, Mulcahy, a member of the 1940 All-Star team, still leads the NL
in losses with 22.

1941
After going 1 for 7 in the twinbill on the 24th, Ted Williams starts the
day with a .401 batting average and refuses a suggestion by Boston manager
Joe Cronin that he sit out the season to preserve his average. Against the
A's he hits one single in 4 at-bats and his average drops to .3995. Dom
DiMaggio's 3-run double helps the Sox win, 5-1.

Catcher George Pfister makes his debut behind the plate for the Dodgers in a
7-3 loss to the Phils. The league rules Pfister, who never signed a Brooklyn
contract, is the property of Montreal (IL), and his name is removed from the
boxscore. But his 0 for 2 will stay in the encyclopedias. Despite the loss,
the Dodgers stay 2 1/2 games ahead of the Cards, 6-5 losers to the Cubs.

Cleveland's Al Smith homers in the 9th inning to beat the Browns, 4-3. His
teammates don't help much, making 7 errors behind him. Jeff Heath hits his
20th triple of the year and will finish with over 20 doubles, triples and
HRs. It will be 38 years before George Brett will duplicate the feat in
the AL.

Cy Slapnicka, GM of the Cleveland Indians since November 1935, resigns
saying, "I simply decided that after six years on the job I preferred a
change.". Oddly, Oscar Vitt, storm center of the Indians in 1940, resigns
today as the manager of Portland (PCL).

In Pittsburgh, the Reds outslug the Pirates to win, 15-9. The victory goes
to sensational rookie Elmer Riddle (19-4), who benefits from a 7-run 7th.

The Yankees tune-up for the World Series with a 4-3 loss to the
Senators. Charlie Keller finally plays, going 0 for 4, while Joe Dimaggio
has 2 RBIs to take the lead 123 to 122 over Keller. The Senators will
shutout New York tomorrow, 5-0.

1942
It is Tony Lupien Day at Fenway, and the Red Sox' Tex Hughson wins his
22nd to tie Mort Cooper for the ML lead, as the Red Sox edge the Yankees,
7-6. A Fenway Park crowd of 26,166 - including 4,293 youngsters who gained
free admission by bringing 29,000 pounds of scrap metal - watches Hughson
scatter 11 hits in going all the way. Johnny Murphy, one of 4 Yank hurlers,
takes the loss. Ted Williams has a single in three at-bats to finish the
season at .356 and wins his second straight batting title. Teammate Johnny
Pesky is 2nd at .331. Williams also leads the ML in HRs (36), RBIs (137),
runs (141) and walks (145). Williams, Pesky and Dom D play their last games
before entering the service. DiMaggio finishes the year with 439 POs and
19 Assists to lead the AL ... his brother Vince leads the NL in the same
categories with 383 and 20.

On the last day of the season, the Cardinals, winners of 9 games out of
10, have a 1 1/2 game lead over the Dodgers, winners of 7 straight. The
Cardinals clinch the NL pennant by winning the first game of a doubleheader
with the Cubs, 9-2. Sore-armed hurler Ernie White throws a five-hit
complete-game. Billy Southworth benches his regulars for game 2, but the
Cards still win, 4-1, giving Johnny Beazley his 21st win of the year. Lou
Novikoff, who led 4 minor leagues in hitting in consecutive years but was
a bust with the Cubs in 1941, gets a "gift hit" when Beazley lets a light
grounder come to a stop so that Lou can maintain a .300 batting average
for the season. Novikoff is 1 for 8 today.

Kirby Higbe wins for the Dodgers, 4-3, at Shibe Park in a meaningless
win. Brooklyn finishes with 104 victories, the most for a runner-up team
since the 1909 Cubs won that many. Phils outfielder Danny Litwhiler completes
his 151st errorless game of the season in a loss to the Dodgers. Litwhiler
becomes the first OF to avoid an error the entire season. He has 308 putouts
and 9 assists on the year. The Dodgers are victorious but their hopes of
a Cub sweep of a doubleheader with St. Louis are smashed as the Cards take
both games. Brooklyn's 104 wins leaves them 2 games in back of the Birds.

1944
The Browns give the lead back by insisting on playing the Red Sox in the rain
under the arcs and then losing, 4-1. The Red Sox had just lost 10 straight.

1945
The Cubs sweep the Reds, 3-1 and 7-4, in Cincinnati. Chicago wins 21 games
against the Reds this year ... their only loss to Cincy came on August 4,
4-3, at Crosley Field. The Cubs extend their ML record to 19 doubleheader
sweeps in a season.

At Yankee Stadium, the 4th-place Yankees whip the Athletics, 8-1. Pitcher
Red Ruffing (7-3), who returned to the team in July, helps his cause with a
3-run homer off Bobo Newsom. It is the 36th (and last) homer of his career
... at this point only Wes Ferrell (38) has hit more as a pitcher. For Bobo,
it is his AL-high 20th loss of the season.

1946
In Detroit's Briggs Stadium, Feller pitches 5 innings striking out 6
Tigers. The Indian fireballer ties Rube Waddell's major league mark with
his 343rd K of the season. Future research, however, will show the future
Hall of Famer had really struck out 349 in 1904. Bob Kuzava takes over for
Feller and gets the win, 9-8.

For the 2nd time in 5 days, the Cubs shell Howie Pollet. The Cubs score 3
runs in the 4th inning to chase the Cardinal ace and win, 7-2. St. Louis
and Brooklyn are now tied for 1st place.

At Fenway, Tex Hughson notches his 20th as the Red Sox win, 5-4, over
Washington. It is Boston's 104th win of the year.

1947
Cards rookie Ken Johnson makes his 1st start a dandy, stopping the Cubs, 3-1,
on one hit, a single by Eddie Waitkus in the 8th. Ralph Hamner is the loser.

1949
The Red Sox, winners of 16 out of the last 19 with the Senators, win the
series opener in Washington, 6-4, collecting 12 hits in the drizzling rain.

At Yankee Stadium, New York's Vic Raschi beats the A's, 3-1, for his 20th
win. Raschi allows just 4 hits.

The Cards lead is cut to a game over the idle Dodgers, as the Pirates defeat
the league leaders, 6-4. The Bucs score 5 unearned runs in the 2nd inning,
capped by rookie Saffell's grand slam HR. Bill Werle (12-12) evens his
record as the Cards have now gone 10 straight games at Pittsburgh without
scoring more than 4 runs.

1950
The Phils rally for 5 runs in the 8th to tie, but the Giants win in 10
innings, 8-7. Monte Irvin, sliding across the plate with the winning run,
injures catcher Andy Seminick, limiting his effectiveness. He will play
the next day and all through the WS, later to find out that he has a bone
separation. In the nitecap, Bobby Thomson's 1st-inning inside-the-park grand
slam is all the Giants need as Jim Hearn wins, 5-0. The Dodgers split with
the Braves cutting the Phillies lead to 2 games.

Against the A's, Whitey Ford relieves and loses his first game after 9
wins. The Yanks lose, 8-7.

1951
Monte Irvin clouts a 3-run homer in the 1st inning off Phils righty Andy
Hansen and Larry Jansen picks up his 21st win, 10-1.

Trying for his 23rd win, Preacher Roe loses just his 3rd game, 4-3, to Chet
Nichols and the Braves. The Dodgers now lead New York by 1/2 game. Future
Hall of Fame NBA basketball player Bill Sharman becomes the only man in
history to be thrown out of a ML baseball game without ever having played
in one. With the score tied at 3-3 in the 8th inning, umpire Frank Dascoli
clears the entire Brooklyn bench after a home plate call by him results in
a violent protest. Sharman, up from St. Paul (AA) at the end of the season,
is one of the players thrown out. Dascoli's safe call at home on Bob Addie's
score results in the winning run.

Gabe Paul replaces the newly elected NL President Warren Giles as GM of
the Cincinnati Reds.

1952
In the Braves' 11-3 rout in Brooklyn, Eddie Mathews becomes the first rookie
to hit three homeruns in a game. The 20-year-old first baseman's offensive
output helps the team to break a ten-game losing streak in a game that will
become the last victory for the National League franchise representing the
city of Boston. Virgil Jester wins, his last in the majors.

Cleveland scores 10 runs in the first 2 innings to coast to an 11-6 win at
Detroit. Bob Chakales, with relief help, wins his first of the year. The
2 teams combine for 9 double plays to tie an AL record set in 1925.

1953
Washington's Mickey Vernon goes into the last game of the season still
fighting for the batting title with Cleveland's Al Rosen. Near the end of the
game, a 9-2 loss to the A's, Vernon is hitting .337 when word arrives that
Rosen's game is over and Vernon is ahead by .0011 points. The possibility
of Vernon coming up to bat again and maybe losing a point is scotched when
his teammates contrive to make an out to end the game. Rosen just misses
beating out an infield hit in his last at-bat in a 7-3 loss to the Tigers.

The St. Louis Browns play both their last game in Sportsman's Park and the
last game in the franchise's 52-year history. Fittingly, they lose, 2-1, to
Billy Pierce and the Chicago White Sox in 11 innings for their 100th defeat
of the season. Reserve 1B Ed Mickelson drives in Johnny Groth in the 4th
inning for the last run of the Browns franchise. The losing pitcher is Duane
Pillette, who goes the distance. The game draws only 3,174 fans. The franchise
will be shifted to Baltimore next season and will be called the Orioles.

The AL owners convene at the Hotel Commodore in New York to vote on the
transfer. It ends in a (4 to 4) tie. Washington, not wanting to alienate
its Maryland fans, votes this time for the move to Baltimore. Tomorrow,
the owners convene and Miles puts an offer of $2,475,000 on the table for
control of Veeck's 79 percent of the Browns stock.

1954
The first episode of NBC's Tonight Show, featuring Steve Allen as the
host along with announcer Gene Rayburn and bandleader Skitch Henderson,
airs nationally for the first time. Giants center fielder Willie Mays, the
NL's leader in batting and eventual MVP of the circuit, appears as one of
the first guests on the 90-minute innovative broadcast that will become a
staple of late-night television.

1956
The Cards' Murry Dickson collects 3 hits and yields just 5, but loses in
13 innings to the Cubs, 3-2. Solly Drake's RBI-single in the 13th off the
40-year-old makes a winner of reliever Jim Brosnan.

Bucky Harris resigns as manager of the Tigers effective at the end of
the season.

1957
Walter O'Malley says he will waive the oil rights to Chavez Ravine.

In a desperate move, New York City Council President Abe "Hit Sign, Win Suit"
Stark says the Dodgers should be urged to enlarge and modernize Ebbets Field.

Owner Paul I. Fagan agrees to rent Seals Stadium to the Giants until
Candlestick is ready. Fagan will pay $125,000 in annual taxes, in exchange
for the parking concession, against 5 percent of the gross revenue.

Ernie Banks goes 5 for 5 against the Cardinals in a 3-2 Cub victory. Jim
Brosnan is the winner for Chicago, while loser Lynn Lovenguth records his
only decision of the year.

1958
The Red Sox drill a 9-5 win over Washington as Runnels and Williams each have
3 hits, but Ted has 2 less at-bats to move ahead in the batting race. The
2 sluggers hit back-to-back HRs in the 4th, off Romanosky.

1959
Phillies second baseman Sparky Anderson goes 0 for 3 and is caught stealing
in a 5-2 loss to Milwaukee at County Stadium. The season finale marks the end
of the 25-year-old infielder's playing career, but the future Hall of Fame
manager's participation in 152 contests will establish a record for the most
games ever played by someone who spent only one year in the major leagues.

In one of the NL's frequent tight races, the Braves and Dodgers finish in a
tie (86-68), with the Giants a close 3rd (83-71). The Dodgers beat Chicago,
7-1, while the Braves beat the Phillies, 5-2. The Giants, eliminated
following the Dodgers' win, drop 2 games to the Cards, 2-1 and 14-8.

1960
Pancho Herrera's 135th strikeout sets a NL record, even though the Phils
beat the Braves, 5-3.

1961
In front of only 1,717 fans at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, Bob Sprout
appears in his only major league game. The Angels starter, who once struck
out 22 batters in a seven-inning no-hitter in the minor leagues, starts
against the Senators allowing four hits and two runs in four innings and
has no role in the decision of his team's 8-6 victory over Washington.

Sandy Koufax (18-13) fans 7 Phils in the course of a 2-1 loss (both runs off
Sandy are unearned) and breaks the National League mark for strikeouts in a
season, surpassing Christy Mathewson's mark of 267 (in 367 IPs) established
in 1903. Unlike the turmoil caused by commissioner Ford Frick's edict of
having to hit 61 homers by the 154th game in the extended 162-game schedule
to break Babe Ruth's single season homerun record, little is made that the
Dodger southpaw's 268th punch-out (in 255 IPs) occurs in the 151st game of
the season, compared to the 142-game sked played early in the century.

Minnesota's Al Schroll take a no-hitter into the 9th inning against Cleveland,
but pinch hitter Don Dillard's single with no outs is the spoiler. Schroll
then walks 2 and gives up a triple to Francona, who scores on a ground
out. Harmon Killebrew hits his 45th as the Twins win, 10-4. Jim Perry takes
the loss.

1962
The Cardinals sidetrack the Giants, 7-4, as Gene Oliver contributes a 3-run
HR and Stan Musial goes 5 for 5.

The Dodger hopes for clinching a tie for the pennant are dashed when Sandy
Koufax, making his 2nd start since returning to action, lasts just 5 innings
against Houston. Reliever Ron Perranoski is the loser, 8-6.

1963
At Colt Stadium, using a lineup of 9 rookies the Colt 45s lose, 10-3, to
the Mets. The lineup includes P Jay Dahl, 17 (debut); C Jerry Grote, 20; 1B
Rusty Staub, 19; 2B Joe Morgan, 20; 3B Glenn Vaughan, 19; SS Sonny Jackson,
19 (debut); and outfielders Brock Davis, 19, Aaron Pointer, 21, and Jim Wynn,
21. Dahl loses his only ML game at 17 and will die in an auto accident at
19. Houston 2B Joe Morgan will play 22 years, and 1B Rusty Staub, 23. Aaron
Pointer singles for his only hit this year ... his sisters will do better
with a top-10 hit of "Fire," by Bruce Springsteen. Joe Hoerner and Danny
Coombs follow Dahl to the mound in their ML debuts. 20-year-old P Larry
Yellen debuted yesterday and 18-year-old OF Ivan Murrell debuts tomorrow.

At St. Louis, the Reds' John Tsitouris pitches a 2-hit 3-0 shutout over the
Cardinals. Gary Kold triples in the 2rd and Dick Groat singles in the 9th. In
his last 3 starts, Tsitouris has pitched 3 shutouts and allowed 8 hits.

1964
The Houston Colt 45's play their final game in Colt Stadium, the team's home
since joining the National League in 1962. The future Astros beat the Dodgers
in the 12th inning, 1-0, when Jimmy Wynn's single plates Bob Aspromonte.

The Philadelphia Inquirer stops its recent practice of printing the Phillies
magic number citing the countdown digit has lost its significance in the
National League race. The fading Phils, which had a 6 1/2 game lead just
six days ago, now clings to a half-game margin, and the team will need
to beat the contenders they will face in five of the six remaining games
to clinch the once 'certain' pennant. Despite 3 HRs by Johnny Callison,
the Phils are 14-8 losers to the Braves, who complete a 4-game sweep at
Connie Mack Stadium. The Phils' 7th straight loss drops them out of first,
which they had held for 73 days. Milwaukee tallied 22 hits - 10 against
Jim Bunning in 4 innings - and four relievers. Joe Torre has two hits
including his 20th homer. Philadelphia is now just a half-game ahead of the
charging Cardinals, winners of 8 straight games. Even the Giants, losers of
a doubleheader against the Cubs, are just 4 1/2 games in back of the Reds,
and will not be eliminated until October 3.

On Fan Appreciation Day at Shea Stadium, a promotion which features egg
tossing contests and wheelbarrow races between games, the Reds sweep a twin
bill from the Mets, 4-1 and 3-1, to take sole possession of first place. Six
days ago, Cincinnati had trailed the Phillies by six and a half games. The
Reds are winners of 9 straight.

1965
Tom Haller clouts 2 HRs to give the Giants an 8-4 win over the Cards. The
Dodgers keep pace by defeating the Reds, 6-1.

A week after sending veteran Ken Boyer to the Mets, St. Louis trades SS Dick
Groat, 1B Bill White and C Bob Uecker to the Phillies for P Art Mahaffey,
OF Alex Johnson and C Pat Corrales.

1966
At St. Louis, the Dodgers win as Don Drysdale pitches his 2nd shutout in
a row, beating the Cardinals.

1967
Jim Bunning ties a National League record suffering his fifth 1-0 defeat of
the season. The hard-luck Phillies right-hander loses to the Astros when,
after two quick outs in the 11th, Rusty Staub doubles and scores on Chuck
Harrison's single. Mike Cuellar is the winner.

Ferguson Jenkins posts the first of his six 20-game-win seasons when the
Cubs beat the Reds at Crosley Field, 4-1. The Canadian right-hander will
lead the American League with 25 victories after Chicago deals the future
Hall of Famer to the Rangers in 1974.

In afternoon games, Cleveland tops Boston, 6-0, while the Twins drop a 5-1
decision to California. In their last games in Kansas City before moving
to Oakland, the 10th-place A's sweep a doubleheader from Chicago, beating
the AL's ERA leaders Gary Peters and Joe Horlen. Peters loses the opener,
5-2, and Horlen the nitecap, 4-0, to rookie Catfish Hunter. Jim Gosger leads
the way for KC by going 5 for 8 in the doubleheader. The two losses on this
"Black Wednesday" drops Chicago to 4th place with only a hope of a tie for
the pennant.

1968
A 1-0 win and 11 strikeouts against the Astros enables the Cardinals'
Bob Gibson to lower his ERA to 1.12, a new NL season mark. His phenomenal
campaign includes 28 complete games, 268 strikeouts and 13 shutouts.

For the 2nd time in two years, the Cards sign free-agent P Barney Schultz to
enable him to qualify for pension time. Schultz was released last October 8.

Facing Lee Stange at Fenway Park, Mantle flies out in his final plate
appearance, before being replaced by Andy Kosko. Kosko's homer ties the
score in the 8th and Pepitone's HR in the 9th gives New York a 4-3 win.

At Detroit, Frank Howard snaps a 1-1 tie with his 44th homer, and the Senators
beat the Tigers, 3-1. Howard's run is his 89th, and he'll finish the year
with that, compiling the most homers in history without scoring 90 runs.

1969
Jim Maloney fires a one-hitter in beating Houston, 3-0, at Crosley Field. Joe
Morgan's 3rd-inning single is the only safety.

1970
The Red Sox smash 4 homers to reach a club-record 201 homers in handing
the Senators their 10th straight loss, 10-1. Winning pitcher Gary Peters
hits a 3-run homer. Conigliaro, and George Scott with 2 homers and 5 RBIs,
are the leaders. The previous Sox high for homers was 197 last season.

The Orioles rally for 2 runs in the 8th inning to beat the Indians' Sam
McDowell, 4-3. Dick Hall wins his 10th game with 3 innings of hitless
relief. He also walks no one and ends the year with more wins than walks -
10 wins and only 6 walks in 61 innings. Not since Slim Sallee's 21 wins in
1919 when he walked 20 has a pitcher accomplished this. Bret Saberhagen in
1994 will be the next, winning 14 and walking 13. Before Sallee, Christy
Mathewson had 2 seasons of more wins than walks.

The Pirates clinch the NL East with a 2-1 win over the Mets. A record crowd
of 50,469 cheers on the Bucs. Boswell, who had played a record 85 games at 2B
without an error, boots a grounder in the 5th for his first E in 389 chances.

1972
A's relief star Darold Knowles breaks his thumb, costing him a chance to
pitch in the WS. Knowles finishes the season with a 5-1 record, 11 saves
and a 1.36 ERA.

Trailing 5-1, the Tigers score 3 in the 8th and 2 in the 9th to beat the
Yankees and Sparky Lyle.

The Dodgers' Don Sutton shuts out San Diego, 2-0, handing Steve Arlin his
NL-high 21st loss of the year. Arlin also led the NL in losses last year
with 19. It's Sutton's 9th shutout of the year to tie Nolan Ryan for the
most in the ML, and his 3rd in a row.

1973
The Angels' Nolan Ryan fans 16 in 11 innings, beating the Twins 5-4. The
final strikeout victim, Rich Reese, is 383 of the season for Ryan, enabling
him to surpass the ML record set by Sandy Koufax in 1965. Ryan opts to skip
his next start on the 30th, thus passing on a shot at 400 K's.

After a series of incidents, the Reds suspend OF Bobby Tolan for
insubordination. Tolan was in several scuffles with club personnel, went
AWOL for 2 days in August, and began growing a beard, a no-no with the
Reds. Tolan, hitting .206, will be traded in November.

1974
Baltimore breaks a scoreless tie with the Brewers in the 17th inning to
pull out a 1-0 win. Grant Jackson wins the decision over Jim Colborn.

1978

Red Sox top the Tigers, 5-2. George Scott hits his 1st homer in a month
and collects his 1000th RBI to back Luis Tiant's win (his 203rd). New York
maintains its lead by beating the Blue Jays, 5-1, at Yankee Stadium.

1981
In the first game of a doubleheader with Chicago, Oakland ties an AL record
with 8 straight singles in the bottom of the first inning, but blows its
5-0 lead and loses, 9-5. The White Sox take the nightcap, 10-3.

1982
Willie McGee's 3-run inside-the-park homerun in the first inning sparks
the Cardinals to a 4-2 win over the Expos, clinching their first NL East
title since divisional play began in 1969.

Atlanta's Phil Niekro shuts out the Giants on 2 hits, 7-0, to push the
Braves back into a first-place tie with the Dodgers in the NL West. The
Dodgers have lost 6 straight games.

1983
Tim Raines becomes the first player since Ty Cobb to steal 70 bases and drive
in 70 runs in the same season, going 3 for 4 with a homerun, a stolen base,
and 4 RBIs in Montreal's 10-4 win over St. Louis.

Jim Beattie fires the first one-hitter in Mariners history, beating Kansas
City, 4-0. U.L. Washington's single in the 3rd inning is the only baserunner
allowed by Beattie in his near-perfect game.

1984
Before a crowd of 2,803, the smallest crowd in Montreal history, the Expos
trim the Cards, 6-3. Paced by back-to-back homers by Carter and Driessen,
the Expos score 6 in the 4th. The Spos will draw 3,613 on September 4, 2001,
their next smallest crowd. In Joey Hesketh's 7-0 shutout over the Mets,
tomorrow, the crowd will be 12,164.

The Indians top the Twins, 4-3, on a 2-out pinch solo homer in the 9th by
Jamie Quirk. Ron Davis serves up the game-winner to Quirk, whose contract
was purchased 3 days ago from the Chicago White Sox. For Quirk, it will
be his only at-bat in a Cleveland uniform during his one-week stint ...
the Tribe will release him on October 1 when the season ends.

1985
Ueberroth says he will "bow' to the "overwhelming desire" of the players

owners, unable to come up with a testing program, end the 1984 drug agreement.

1986
Jack Morris shuts out the Yankees, 1-0 in 10 innings, raising his record
to 20-8 and snapping Don Mattingly's hitting streak at 24 consecutive games.

1987
Phil Niekro makes his final ML appearance and is pounded for 5 runs in 3
innings in Atlanta's 15-6 loss to the Giants. Niekro, who had been released
earlier in the season by Toronto, agreed to pitch one last game for the
Braves, the team with which he spent his first 19 ML seasons.

Shea Stadium is packed with 48,588 fans to see the Mets clobber the Pirates,
12-3, making the Mets the 2nd franchise in ML history to break the 3
million barrier in season attendance. St. Louis will also draw 3 million
fans this season.

In his final plate appearance of the year at Wrigley, Andre Dawson crashes his
47th HR to lead the Cubs to a 7-3 win over the Cardinals. Dawson will finish
with 49 round trippers on his way to the MVP. He also draws just 32 walks.

1989
After he grounds out to second base to end the Mets' disappointing season,
Gregg Jeffries charges the mound and wrestles Phillies reliever Roger McDowell
to the ground. The fight, which sparks a season-ending bench-clearing brawl,
is apparently ignited by the Phillies' reliever when he says something
to his former New York teammate who is running to first, but the rookie
infielder will claim his anger was caused by a brushback pitch thrown a
few days earlier by the Philadelphia pitcher.

The two San Francisco Bay teams clinch their divisions. Oakland wins the AL
West by beating Texas, 5-0, while San Francisco loses, 1-0, to the Dodgers
but is assured of the NL West crown when the 2nd-place Padres lose to the
Reds, 2-1 in 13 innings.

with Tom Kelly as the manager. The victory makes the Minnesota native the
winningest skipper in team history.

18 Texas Rangers in a 3-2 Mariners' loss. Ron Guidry of the Yankees set
the mark against California on June 17, 1978.

At Yankee Stadium, Jack Morris wins his 20th of the year, going 6 innings
in a 12-2 blowout over the 4th-place Yanks. Toronto scores 9 runs off Scott

Jays clinch their third consecutive American League East title. Toronto
will go on to beat the Phillies in six games capturing their second straight
World Series.

1996
At Coors Field, Giants left fielder Barry Bonds swipes his 40th base to
become only the second player in major league history to have 40 homers and
40 stolen bases in the same season. Jose Canseco became the charter member
of the 40-40 club in 1988 playing for the A's. Bonds has 42 homers. San
Francisco tops Colorado, 9-3, with a 7-run 7th.

Mark Wohlers sets a Braves record with his 39th save of the season. The
right-handed reliever is less than perfect, throwing two wild pitches to
give up a ninth-inning run, but hangs on to preserve Atlanta's 6-4 victory
over the Expos at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.

After being ejected for arguing a strike call in the 1st inning of Baltimore's
game against the Blue Jays, Orioles 2B Roberto Alomar spits in the face of
umpire John Hirschbeck. Alomar claims he was provoked by Hirschbeck, but
the incident will set off a national debate. After the game, Alomar remarks,
"I used to respect him a lot. He had problems with his family when his son
died - I know that's something real tough in life - but after that he just
changed, personality-wise. He just got real bitter." When the ump hears
about the remarks tomorrow he will charge into the Orioles locker room and
have to be restrained by fellow ump Joyce. Alomar will be suspended for
five games. He appeals the decision and is allowed to play the next day
helping Baltimore clinch the wild card.

The Angels score 2 runs in the top half of the 15th inning, then hold on
as Texas fights back for 1 in their half, to earn a 4-3 victory. LF Garret
Anderson gets 6 hits for California and drives home 3 runs.

1997
The Mariners hand Randy Johnson his 20th win when the Big Unit pitches the
5th and 6th innings in relief of Omar Olivares and Seattle beats Oakland,
9-3. Johnson is the first 20-game winner in M's history. The Mariners

innings. Johnson was sidelined from August 20th to September 13th with a
finger injury.

1998
In the season finale, Mark McGwire ends the historic season hitting his 69th
and 70th homeruns in the Cardinals' 6-3 win over the Expos. Big Mac hits #70
in his last at-bat off Expos rookie Carl Pavano of Southington, Connecticut.

In the Blue Jay's 2-1 victory over the Tigers, Detroit pinch-hitter Bobby
Higginson homers with two outs off Blue Jay Roy Halladay to spoil the
rookie's bid for a no-hitter. The Denver, Colorado native comes within one
out of allowing no hits in only his second major league start.

The Yankees win their seventh straight game to end the season with a .704
winning percentage. The Bronx Bombers (114-48) become the first team since
the 1954 Indians (111-43) to play over .700 ball for the entire season.

Padres reliever Trevor Hoffman ties the National League saves record as he
gets three straight outs in a 3-2 victory over Arizona. His 53rd save (out
of 54 chances) matches the standard set by current teammate Randy Myers,
who did it for the Cubs in 1993. Padres OF Greg Vaughn hits his 50th HR of
the season. He is the 4th player this year to reach that plateau, marking
the 1st time in major league history that 4 players have done so.

Oakland's Rickey Henderson becomes the oldest SB leader in major league
history as he finishes the year with an AL-high 66.

The Reds double up on the Pirates, beating them 4-1. Cincinnati uses
a brother infield of Brett Boone at 2B (0 for 4) and his brother Aaron
(1 for 2) at 3B; Barry Larkin at SS (0 for 3) and Stephen Larkin at 1B
(1 for 3). Aaron Boone's 3-run homer gives Tomko (13-12) the complete-game
victory. Stephen Larkin is a career minor leaguer with a pacemaker and had

the road for TB since a July 29 drubbing of the Yankees.

The Astros push across a run in the 9th against Salomon Torres to tie the
Pirates at 6 all. Houston scores in the top of the 15th to win, 7-6. For

in an effort get more 'energy' into the domed ball park.

The Phillies capture their fourth consecutive NL East title when they beat
Washington, 8-0, behind Roy Halladay's two-hit complete-game. Unlike the

the lineup, this year's squad excels due to a strong starting rotation that
includes Cole Hamels and Roy Oswalt, in addition to Halladay.
