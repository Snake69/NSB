1901
Jimmy Sheckard becomes the first 20th-century player to hit grand slams in
2 consecutive games, as Brooklyn pounds Cincinnati, 16-2. Frank Kitson
homers and takes the victory. The 41 runs in 2 games is a franchise
record. Sheckard's mark won't be tied until 1937.

1903
In a 12-2 win over Washington, Bill Bradley of Cleveland hits for the cycle
and adds an extra double for 12 total bases.

At New York, the Highlanders take a pair from the St. Louis Browns, winning
6-2 and 8-6. Jack Chesbro is the victor in the opener with a bit of help
from the Browns' John Anderson (as noted by Peter Morris). The Browns make 4
straight hits in the 8th, and an error by Kid Elberfeld on Anderson's grounder
loads the bases. With Bobby Wallace hitting, Anderson inexplicably takes off
for 2nd base and is thrown out trying to scramble back to 1B, a play that
will be referred to in the early part of the century as a "John Anderson
play." Wallace strikes out on the play. Anderson explains that "I got too far
off first base and couldn't get back." To which his manager McAleer responds,
"Tell me, you big bum, where did you think you were going?" After the game
Clark Griffith brings up the possibility of a trade again and finds that
the price had gone down. "Give me an old bat bag or anything," says McAleer,
"and take the big stiff." Anderson will be swapped to New York next month.

In a doubleheader split with the Highlanders, Detroit's Bill Lush lashes
3 triples in the game 1 victory, 13-8. New York takes game 2, 5-1.

1904
Cubs P Bob Wicker, who pitched a 12-inning one-hitter in June, allows just
one hit in regulation in beating Brooklyn, 4-0. Lumley hits a grounder to
Chance who throws high to Wicker covering 1B for a scratch hit. Chicago
also takes the nitecap, 7-4 in 7 innings.

At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson wins his 32nd, defeating the Pirates,
3-1. Matty allows just 4 hits - two each to Ginger Beaumont and Tommy Leach -
in beating Joe Robataille.

1905
In his first two at-bats, Cy Seymour lines two inside-the-park homeruns to
pace the Reds to an 8-3 win over visiting Brooklyn. The Reds win game 2 by
an 8-7 score. Seymour will finish the season with a NL-high .377 average,
and lead the league in hits (219), doubles (40), triples (21), total bases
(325), SA (.559) and RBIs (121). He'll be 2nd in homers to teammate Odwell.

1906
In the 2nd game of a DH, Cardinals hurler Stoney McGlynn tosses a 7-inning
no-hitter against Brooklyn. The game ends in a 1-1 tie.

The Cubs pound the Giants twice to complete a 3 game sweep in New
York. Chicago wins the opener 6-2, then jump on Mathewson for 16 hits and
10 runs to win, 10-5 in 8 innings. Jimmy Sheckard has 4 hits off Matty.

Ed Walsh allows a first-inning run, and that is all the Highlanders' Bill
Hogg needs as he buffaloes the White Sox, 1-0, on 2 hits. A rain of bottles
interrupts the game in the 8th as ump Silk O'Laughlin is the target of the
fans' wrath.

1907
Mathewson shuts out the Pirates, 2-0, while Bill Klem continues his battle
with the Giants by tossing 4 more, including McGraw.

Pittsburgh's Honus Wagner steals four bases, including 2B, 3B and home in
the 2nd inning against the Giants. Not to be outdone, his teammate Fred
Clark also swipes 4 bases for the only time in his career. The Pirates blow
out the Giants, 14-1.

After Cleveland's Addie Joss fired a one-hitter in a 3-1 win over the
Highlanders yesterday, teammate Heinie Berger matches him today, also against
hapless New York. This is the 2nd time so far this century that teammates will
throw back-to-back one-hitters (as noted by Steve Boren). Cleveland wins, 6-0.

1908
Pulliam upholds O'Day's delayed decision and declares the game a tie,
a decision nobody likes. The Cubs demand the game be forfeited to them
as the crowd prevented play from continuing, although darkness would have
soon ended it. Both teams appeal. Pulliam sees no inconsistency with the
September 4th incident and claims he has merely upheld his umpire on a
question of fact in each case. Meanwhile, the Giants beat the Cubs, 5-4,
after almost blowing a 5-0 lead. Hooks Wiltse is relieved by Mathewson,
and the official scorer awards the W to Matty. The L goes to Three Finger
Brown, his first loss to Mathewson since June 13, 1905.

Washington's Walter Johnson three-hits Cleveland to win, 2-1. The loss
stops Cleveland's win streak at 10.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1909
Charles Tenhuy of Dayton (Central League) dies as a result of a skull
fracture when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Hagerman of Grand Rapids.

1910
In another matchup of aces, the Giants score 4 runs in the 1st inning off
Three Finger Brown, who is lifted after six innings trailing, 5-1. The Cubs
rally against Christy Mathewson, and score 2 runs in both the 8th and 9th
innings to tie. Larry Doyle, whose sloppy play helped the Cubs scoring,
singles home the winning run for New York in the bottom of the 9th. Despite
the Cubs tying the game after his departure, Brown is handed the loss.

1911
After 41 straight shutout innings, Grover Alexander is scored on by the
Cards in the 6th inning. The Phillies are victorious, 8-2.

1913
Mathewson scatters 11 Brooklyn safeties and walks none to beat Ed Reulbach,
2-1. It is Matty's 25th win. He will finish the year with 25 victories and
21 walks.

1914
At New York, the Cardinals win their 3rd game in a row over the stumbling
Giants, 4-3. Cozy Dolan's 9th-inning double off reliever Christy Mathewson
drives home the winning score.

1916
Marty Kavanaugh, Indians utility man, hits the AL's first pinch-hit grand
slam in a 5-3 win over the first place Red Sox. The 5th-inning hit is
a sizzling grounder over 3B that rolls under a screen in far left field
and cannot be retrieved in time for a play at the plate. Kavanagh's blast
comes off Boston's Dutch Leonard and ends Boston's 7-game win streak. Dutch
allows 4 hits, all for extra bases. The Sox are 2 1/2 games ahead of Chicago,
winners over the Yankees.

In the first game of a doubleheader, the Browns' George Sisler bats 3rd and
pitches his 2nd game in 8 days, tossing a complete game, but losing, 2-0,
to the A's Harry Siebold. Siebold has an RBI double to help his cause. Sisler
plays first base in game 2 as the Browns win, 3-2, behind Ernie Koob. Parnham
allows just 4 hits, all for extra bases, and walks 4. One of the walks is
to Koob, who goes hitless, ending the season at 0 for 41, but coaxing 15
walks. Koob is the only player to draw more than 7 walks in a hitless season.

1917
At the Polo Grounds, Slim Sallee tops the Cards, 2-1, and clinches the NL
pennant for the Giants, their 6th under McGraw. The New Yorkers manage just
4 hits (and six walks) off Bill Doaks, but they come when needed.

Babe Ruth shuts out the champion White Sox, 3-0, scattering nine hits. The
Babe is 0 for 3 at the plate.

The 3rd-place Indians fashion a 5-4 win over the A's, the 10th win in a
row for the Tribe. Ray Chapman doubles, then steals 3B and home to lead
the Indians. It is his 4th steal of home during this month. Chapman will
also finish the year with 67 sacrifices, a ML record. The previous mark
was Bill Bradley's 60, in 1908.

1919
Trying for his 30th win, Eddie Cicotte goes 7 innings, allowing ten Brownie
hits, before exiting on the short end of a 5-4 score. The White Sox rally
to win 6-5 and clinch the pennant; the final margin will be 3 1/2 games
over the Indians. On the 28th, Cicotte will throw 2 innings against the
Tigers as a World Series warm-up.

The Brooklyn Robins defeat the Phillies twice on Fred Luderus Day in
Philadelphia, winning 4-1 and 14-7. The 2nd game is the 525th in a row played
by the Philadelphia first sacker, who is presented with a diamond stickpin
and gold watch between games to commemorate his endurance effort. He'll
end the season with a consecutive-game streak of 533, a ML record.

After the Red Sox win the opener behind Jack Quinn, 4-0 at the Polo Grounds,
Boston's Waite Hoyt pitches 9 perfect innings - 27 outs - against the
Yankees, but they come in between the 4th and the 13th in which he gives
up hits. He loses, 2-1 in the 13th, when Wally Pipp triples and scores on
Del Pratt's sac fly to Ruth. Boston's only score is the Babe's 28th homer
of the year, off Bob Shawkey in the 9th, to "set a new world's record"
(NY Times). It is believed to be the longest hit at the Polo Grounds,
heading over the RF roof and landing on adjacent Manhattan Field.

The Giants divide a twinbill with the Braves, winning the opener, 6-1,
behind Jess Barnes' 24th win of the year. The Giants collect 16 hits with
Art Fletcher making 4. Wilbur Hubbell makes his debut in the nitecap,
but the Giants' bats are silent and he loses, 3-2 in 10 innings.

1920
In the first game of a twinbill, Babe Ruth hits his 50th HR in the first
inning, off the Senators' Jose Acosta. He then adds number 51 in a 4 for 4
second game, a 2-1 win, to give the Yankees a sweep. The other 3 hits off
loser Shaw are by Phelps.

At League Park, Duster Mails pitches Cleveland to a Friday afternoon 2-0
victory over the White Sox, dropping them to 1 1/2 games back. In the 5th,
Mails walks three straight batters on 12 pitches, but stays in and strikes
out the side. No Sox reach base after that.

1921
Browns pitcher Dixie Davis pitches both ends of the doubleheader against
the Red Sox, scattering 9 hits and losing the opener 2-1, then coasting to
an 11-0 win in the nitecap.

Harry Heilmann is 3 for 4 against Walter Johnson, but Washington wins the
game over Detroit, 5-1. Ty Cobb is so incense by the umpiring of Billy
Evans that he challenges him to a fight. The two future Hall of Famers go
at it with Cobb getting the best of Evans. George Hildebrand, the 2nd ump
assigned to the game, reports the incident to AL prexy Ban Johnson. When
Johnson fails to act, Commissioner Landis steps in and suspends Cobb,
but allows him to continue as a non-playing manager.

At the Polo Grounds, George Uhle shuts out the Yankees for a 9-0 win to
put the Indians back in a virtual tie with New York for 1st place. OF Smoky
Joe Wood has a triple and in 66 games he will have 60 RBIs in 194 at-bats,
the most ever by a player with less than 200 ABs. He won't play tomorrow.

1922
Cardinals outfielder Rogers Hornsby hits homeruns off Giant hurlers Jesse
and Virgil Barnes. The homers served up by the brothers enable the 'Rajah'
to set the National League record for round trippers in a season with 42.
Rosy Ryan, in relief of Hugh McQuillan, picks up the 10-6 Cards win.

1923
Bill Terry takes his first swings in a Giants uniform as a pinch hitter. On
September 30th he will play his first game at 1B and get his first hit in
a 4-3 win over Boston.

Detroit pitcher Ray Francis, with a 3-0 lead over the Yankees, issues a
bases-loaded walk to Babe Ruth, but hangs on for the victory.

1924
Brooklyn's Burleigh Grimes dusts 6 batters in the first two innings and
bests the Cubs, 6-5. Reliever Rip Wheeler takes the loss. 30,000 Brooklyn
fans celebrate the team's showing at the 160th Street Regiment Armory where
each player receives a gold watch. Manager Robinson predicts that the Robins
will overtake the Giants in the next few days.

Carl Mays wins his 20th for the Reds, 9-6, over the hosts Phils, becoming
the first pitcher to win 20 for 3 different teams in his career. Grover
Cleveland "Pete" Alexander's 21 wins for the Cards in 1927 will make him
the 2nd; Gaylord Perry will be 3rd in 1978.

1925
Washington takes two from Cleveland, 4-3 and 6-2, while the A's lose to
St. Louis, 6-4, and the Senators clinch their 2nd pennant.

At Yankee Stadium, Babe Ruth hits a 10th-inning grand slam with the Yankees
down by 3 runs to give New York a 6-5 win. It is the first so-called ultimate
grand slam this century, and the only one in the AL that will come in extra
innings (according to David Vincent). The next ultimate HR by a Yankee will
also come in extra innings - Jason Giambi's 14th inning blow in 2002. Ruth's
blow, off Sarge Connally in relief of Red Faber, makes a winner of starter
Ben Shields.

1926
At the Polo Grounds, the Cardinals clinch the pennant by beating the Giants,
6-4, behind Flint Rhem and Bill Sherdel. Billy Southworth homers to help
beat his old teammates, negating Bill Terry's 3-run HR off Rhem. The Cards
are now ahead of Cincinnati by three games with two to play. The Reds lose
to the Phillies today, 9-2.

1927
The Yankees win their 106th, 6-0 over Detroit, for a new AL high. They will
win 110, a record until the 1954 Indians win 111.

1928
The Tigers draw 404 fans for their last meeting with the last place Red Sox,
winning 8-0 behind Sam Gibson's 5-hitter. (The meager amount of fans at Navin
Field is the lowest American League attendance ever recorded in Detroit.) Pat
Simmons is knocked out in the 7th when he gives up consecutive triples to
Al Wingo, batting 9th, John Stone and Charlie Gehringer. Harry Heilmann has
a HR and a double for Detroit. Jack Rothrock is busy for Boston playing LF,
SS and pitching a shutout last inning. On September 29, Rothrock will catch
an inning against the Indians before moving to left field to replace pitcher
Danny MacFayden. With that move, Rothrock plays all 9 positions this year,
plus pinch hitting and pinch running.

1929
The Yankees celebrate Babe Ruth Day at Fenway by winning, 5-3, over
Boston. Ruth is 2 for 3 with a double. Tom Zachary wins his 12th without
a loss ... his 12-0 season record will not be equaled.

Brooklyn rookie Johnny Frederick connects for his 52nd double in the Dodgers'
8-6 loss to the Phils. This will be the NL record until Klein clouts 59
next year. But Frederick will add 2 homers in the coming games to end the
season with 82 extra base hits, a ML record for rookies that will not be
matched this century. Albert Pujols, in 2001, will break the mark.

The Giants sweep the Braves, 5-4 and 6-5, as Mel Ott hits a homer in each
game, his 41st and 42nd HRs of the year. This ties Rogers Hornsby's NL mark.

1931
Lefty Grove wins his 31st, beating the Red Sox, 9-4, his 11th straight
win over the Red Sox stretching back to May 26, 1930. Since July 25,
1930, Grove's record is 46-4, the best 50 decision streak in the century,
as noted by Jim Kaplan. Lefty will lead the league in wins and saves,
the last pitcher to do so.

The round-robin playoff among New York City's 3 ML teams, to raise money
for the unemployed, concludes with Brooklyn losing to both the Giants and
the Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Again, a near capacity crowd turns out and
adds $48,000 to bring the fund to $108,000. In field events held between
games, Babe Ruth, normally a left-handed hitter, bats right and wins the
fungo hitting contest. He breaks the old distance record held by Big Ed
Walsh. Ruth's drive lands in deep center field, 421 feet away. The old
record, set 20 years earlier, was 419 1/2 feet.

1932
Jimmie Foxx hits his 2nd grand slam in 3 days, giving him 57 homers for
the season, but the A's lose in the 10th to Washington, 8-7.

In a battle of Boston collegians, Harvard beats BC. Charlie Devens,
former Harvard hurler, makes his ML debut for the Yankees and beats Boston,
8-2. The loss goes to Eddie Gallagher, a former Boston College pitcher who
exits in the 5th. Babe Ruth swats his 41st homer of the year in the 9th
and Lou Gehrig belts his 34th in the 5th. The series-bound Yankees will
end the season with a new ML record of scoring in every game. Not until
the 2000 Reds will a team match this mark.

1933
Detroit's Tommy Bridges reaches the 9th inning with a no-hitter for the
3rd time this season and the 4th time in 2 years. He yields a pair of hits
as Detroit beats the Browns, 7-0. Despite the win, Bucky Harris resigns as
manager of the Tigers.

Lefty Grove wins his 24th game, replacing starter Emmett McKeithan after
4 innings and the A's leading, 8-3. The final score is 11-4, with General
Crowder taking the loss. But Grove's win is tainted. The Athletics "contrived"
to give Grove the sure win, so that he could finish the season with more wins
than NL star Carl Hubbell, who will finish with 23. AL President Harridge
will reverse the official scorer's decision next week and gives the win to
McKeithan, but the league eventually returns the win to Grove.

1934
Idle Detroit wins the pennant, as the Red Sox beat the Yankees, 5-0, in
the season's finale at Yankee Stadium. Ruth walks in the first inning,
limps to 1B, and leaves for a pinch runner in his last home game as a Yankee.

The Cardinals beat the Cubs, 3-1, and move 2 games behind the Giants with
6 games left.

1935
The Cards rebound to whip the Pirates, 11-2, behind Bill Hallahan to set
up the critical 5-game series with the leading Cubs.

The Indians whip the White Sox, 14-7, as Hal Trosky belts his 25th HR and
Joe Vosmik (.349) is 2 for 5.

1936
The Giants clinch the pennant, winning 2-1 in the 10th of the opening game
of a doubleheader with the Boston Bees. Pitcher Hal Schumacher singles in
the winning run.

1938
At Wrigley Field, the Cubs clip the Cardinals, 9-3, beating Lon Warneke. Gabby
Hartnett hits a homer as the Cubs win for the 15th time in 18 games.

Pittsburgh's Russ Bauers whips the visiting Reds, 4-1, on six hits to keep
the Bucs two games ahead. Johnny Vander Meer is the loser.

1939
OF Johnny Cooney of the Boston Bees, playing at the Polo Grounds, hits
his first HR after 15 years as P/OF in the majors. The dinger is a two-run
shot off Randy Gumbert in game 1 of a Sunday twinbill, but the Giants win,
5-4. Tomorrow Cooney will repeat the feat. Boston wins game 2, 5-3, behind
George Barnicle's 2nd ML win in 5 days.

1940
At Shibe Park, George Caster of the Philadelphia Athletics allows 6 HRs
against the Boston Red Sox, four of them coming in the 6th inning when
the Sox total 25 bases and an AL record 17 extra bases on long hits. Ted
Williams, Jimmie Foxx and Joe Cronin connect successively, with Foxx' HR his
500th career homer. Bobby Doerr hits a triple and Jim Tabor adds another HR
in the 6th as Boston barely wins, 10-9 in 10 innings, clouting 5 doubles,
3 triples and 6 homers. Boston then wins the 2nd game, 3-2. It is the 3rd
time that Foxx has been part of a three consecutive-homer barrage.

With all their September games now at Municipal Stadium, the Indians drop
a 7-2 game to the lowly Browns. Red Sox and Tiger castoff Eldon Auker
outpitches Mel Harder for his 15th win. With the Tigers rained out, the
Indians are 1 1/2 back.

The Yankees sweep a pair from the Senators with fireman Johnny Murphy winning
both games. Murphy pitches the 10th inning of the opening 6-5 win, then
tosses 2 2/3 innings of the nitecap, a 9-4 win stopped after 6 1/2 innings
because of darkness. The Murphy wins puts the Yankees at 2 1/2 games back.

1941
The Cardinals top the Pirates, 4-0, behind Harry Gumbert, as Musial drives
in 3 runs. But the Cards have just 3 games left.

At Boston, the Dodgers maintain their 1 1/2 game lead over the Cards by
beating the Braves, 4-2. Celebrating his birthday, Dixie Walker's 7th-inning
triple drives home three Dodger runs, and Kirby Higbe wins his 22nd.

At Washington, the Red Sox take a pair from the Senators, winning 7-2 and 5-4,
as Dom DiMaggio has a grand slam in the opener. Ted Williams has a hit in
game two, but goes hitless in game one. However, he receives two walks which
never get credited in his year-end totals, according to research in 2002 by
Herm Krabbenhoft. Williams' base on balls total for the year should read 147.

The Yanks down the A's, 7-2, as Joe DiMaggio hits #29 and #30, the fifth
year in a row he's reached the 30 mark. His three RBIs move him close to
idle Charlie Keller.

1942
Mort Cooper tosses his 10th shutout of the year to give the Cardinals a
6-0 two-hit victory over the Reds. Cooper's 22nd win of the year clinches
at least a Cardinal tie for the pennant.

1943
A crowd of 314, the smallest in Wrigley Field history, sees Andy Pafko
make his Cubs debut. Pafko drives in 4 runs with a double and a single in 3
at-bats, as the Cubs top the Phillies, 7-4. Mercifully, the game is called
after 5-innings because of the downpour.

1946
Disappointing on the field, the Yankees nevertheless finish their home season
with a 2,309,029 attendance, the first team to reach two million. The best
previous draw was the 1929 Cubs at 1,485,166. Total ML attendance was 18.5
million, 80 percent more than 1945.

Led by Hank Greenberg's three homers, the Tigers roll by the Browns, 4-3
and 10-1. The veteran slugger was benched on August 22nd but now has 41
homers. Hutchinson and Trout are the winners.

Ted Wilks, in relief of Munger, notches a 2-1 win for the Cardinals. Johnny
Vander Meer takes the loss for the Reds; he'll win his next start, 1-0. For
the Reds, it is the ML record 41st one-run loss this season. Six years ago
they set the mark for one-run wins with 41.

1948
The Red Sox knock out Vic Raschi in the 4th inning and Ted Williams drives
in three runs with a double and a bases-loaded walk. But the Yankees whip
the Red Sox, 9-6, scoring two gift runs when Ellis Kinder forgets to cover
first base. Meanwhile, Cleveland snaps its seven game win streak when Detroit
beats them, 4-3, behind Freddie Hutchinson's 7-hitter. New York, Boston and
Cleveland are now tied for 1st place in the AL with identical 91-56 records.

In Chicago, AL president Will Harridge tosses a coin and then announces
the schedule should there be a three-way tie at the end of the season,
just seven games away.

1949
At Boston, Ellis Kinder (15-1 at Fenway Park) pitches a 6-hitter and Williams
lines his 42nd HR to beat the Yankees, 2-0, and pull the Red Sox within a game
of New York. Kinder has now won 13 straight games and is 4-0 against New York.

At New York Bob Elliott hits 3 successive HRs for Boston, as the Braves
down the Giants, 6-4. Spahn, who wins his 20th, the first NL hurler to reach
the mark this year, also homers. Elliott will end the decade with 903 RBIs,
tops for the span. Though his years were interrupted by military service,
Ted Williams will finish 2nd with 893 RBIs for the 1940s.

Don Newcombe receives a car and other gifts before the game, then chalks
up a 4-hit 8-1 win over the Phillies. The win keeps Brooklyn a half game
behind the Cards.

1950
Pitcher Erv Palica of the Dodgers is the star today pitching a 2-hitter
in an 11-0 win over Philadelphia, and hitting a 5th-inning grand slam off
Bubba Church of the Phils. The win cuts the Phillies' lead to 5 games. The
Phils will win 2 out of 3 in Boston to put the Braves out of the race.

Mental lapses crush Tiger hopes. Due to heavy smoke from a Canadian forest
fire, Detroit puts on the lights in a Sunday afternoon contest with the
Indians. Cleveland's only score in 9 innings is pitcher Bob Lemon's HR in
the 4th, as the match is tied 1-1 on Johnny Lipon's HR. Lemon opens the 10th
with a triple, and 2 intentional walks follow. With the bases loaded and
one out, C Aaron Robinson thinks he has a shot at a DP by just stepping on
home. Because of the haze, he did not see 1B Don Kolloway remove the force
after fielding the ball hit by slugger Luke Easter, and the Indians win, 2-1.

66,924 fans are on hand for Johnny Mize Day at Yankee Stadium, as the
Yankees top the fading Red Sox 9-5 to go 4 games up on Boston and 2 1/2
ahead of Detroit. The 38-year-old first baseman and future Hall of Famer
contributes to the victory with a single and double. Rizzuto contributes a
single, double and HR, while Berra adds 4 hits including a triple. DiMag's
hit streak reaches 15. New York will win 5 of their next 7, while the Tigers
will manage to go 4-3.

Carlos Pascual makes his ML debut and matches fellow Cubans on the Senators
- Marrero, Consuegra and Moreno - by notching a victory, beating the A's,
3-1. For 19-year-old Carlos, this is his lone ML win, but his brother Camilo
will fare better. Kucab, making his first ML start after 2 relief appearances,
is the loser.

After the Reds win the opener against Pittsburgh, 7-1, behind Ewell Blackwell,
the Bucs take the nitecap, 3-2, on Wally Westlake's steal of home on the
front end of a double steal in the 6th inning. Murry Dickson is the winner.

1951
The Giants score with 2 outs in the 9th inning to edge the Braves' Chet
Nichols, 4-3. Eddy Stanky drives home the winner with a single off 3B Sibby
Sisti's glove. Dave Koslo wins in relief.

1952
At Fenway, New York's Johnny Sain relieves in the 10th for a 3-2 win in
the opener, then relieves in the nightcap to preserve an 8-6 win. Mantle
leads the way with a homer, triple, 2 doubles and a single on the afternoon,
driving in 6 runs. His triple in the 10th wins the opener, and his 4th-inning
homer in the nightcap, off Mel Parnell, gives New York a 7-0 lead. Boston
comes back to cut the lead to one run in the 8th inning when they score
two runs off Bob Kuzava. In the 9th, Mantle misses on a sac bunt attempt,
then doubles home Rizzuto with another run. New York now leads Cleveland
by 2 games with 4 to play.

Cleveland keeps pace with the Yankees by beating the White Sox, 6-0, behind
Bob Lemon's 3-hitter. Lemon wins his 23rd and pitches his 21st complete game,
both AL highs. He has now pitched 309 2/3 innings, the only pitcher in the
1950s to pitch 300 innings in a year.

1954
The Tigers stall the Indians' pennant clinch, topping the Tribe, 6-4. Ted
Gray is the winner over Bob Lemon. Jim Delsing and Ray Boone homer for
Detroit, while Cleveland's George Strickland hits his first homer since
early in the season.

Arnie Portocarrero stops the A's 15-game losing streak to the Yankees by
winning, 5-1, at Yankee Stadium. Arnie fans 11, including 3 straight pinch
hitters - Berberet, Triandos and Leja - in the 9th. Littrell hits a 3-run
homer for his first ML HR.

Phillie Murry Dickson loses his 20th game of the season, 1-0, to New York's
lefty Don Liddle. It marks the 3rd consecutive season he leads the NL in
losses. The Phils then take the nitecap, 4-2, routing Windy McCall.

In an odd doubleheader with three teams playing, the Milwaukee Braves finish

1975
Tom Seaver's bid for a no-hitter is again spoiled in the 9th by a little-known

Josh Johnson.

Michael Wacha just misses becoming the 22nd rookie ever to throw a no-hitter

half-a-million bucks. The Minnesota right-hander, who held Arizona to one
run over eight innings, finishes his first year the team with an 11.63 K/BB
