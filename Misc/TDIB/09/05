1901
In the first of two in Detroit, Tiger ace Roscoe Miller puts on a disgraceful
exhibition against the A's, lobbing in the ball, grinning as the A's batters
hit it, and throwing a bunt into the stands to allow 3 runs to score. Miller
settles down in the last 3 innings, allowing only a single, but the Tigers
lose, 11-9. His performance is explained by writers in that he is in one
of his sulks. The A's light up rookie Yip Owen in game 2 to win, 9-3.

In Chicago, the heads of seven minor leagues meet to set guidelines. Attending
are Pat Powers (Eastern League), Tom Hickey (Western League), John Farrell
(NY State League), Michael Saxton (Three-I League) William Myer Jr (Western
Assoc), W. H. Lucas (Pacific NW League) and T.H. Murnane (New England
League). Proxies of compliance are sent by 4 other leagues as well. The
meeting sets roster sizes, fines and a reserve clause. Importantly, it also
establishes the league classifications of A, B, C and D.

The first-place Pirates have an easy time in New York, beating the Giants,
15-1 and 15-7. Larry Hesterfer makes his only ML appearance in game 2,
going the distance and allowing all 15 runs. Only 5 are earned.

In Brooklyn, the Reds lose, 3-2 in 10 innings, when George Magoon and
Bill Fox make errors in the fading light. A peculiar play occurs in the
8th when a wild pitch bounds into the stands and back out again enabling
Dodger catcher Duke Farrell to nab Harry Steinfeldt at the plate.

In the bottom of the 9th in Boston, Gene DeMontreville hits a two-out
three-run homer to give the Beaneaters a 6-5 win over the Cards. Boston
comes back from a five-run deficit after 7 innings. St. Louis is led by
Jesse Burkett who has a single, a triple and a homerun. The St. Louis Post
Dispatch notes that after Burkett hit his second-inning homer, he stood at
home plate and watched it clear the left field fence before trotting around
the bases behind Bill Magee.

1902
The St. Louis Browns roll by visiting Boston, 12-3, helped by John
Anderson. The veteran, known as the "Terrible Swede" (he was born in Norway)
hits a grand slam in the 8th.

1903
In a game stopped by rain after 5 innings, Christy Mathewson beats Brooklyn's
Bill Reidy, 3-1, allowing just one hit and striking out 5. The only Superbas'
score comes in the 4th when RF George Browne makes two errors.

At Boston, the Americans trounce the Athletics, 12-1 in 8 innings. Patsy
Dougherty leads the way with 3 triples and two singles.

1904
In Front of 37,000 fans the Giants sweep the Beaneaters, beating Boston
6-1 and 4-3. Mathewson wins the opener, beating Irv Wilhelm, and is not
scored upon until the 9th when Jim Delahanty and Tom Needham triple. Red
Ames wins the nitecap. Following the Giant sweep, excited fans hoist John
McGraw up to carry him to the Polo Grounds field house. But McGraw gets
dropped during the excitement, sustaining a sprained ankle.

1905
When Boston beats the Athletics, 3-2 in 13 innings, they score the first
runs off Rube Waddell in 44 innings. Waddell strikes out 17.

1908
At Brooklyn's Washington Park, Nap Rucker pitches a no-hitter for Brooklyn
against the Boston Doves, 6-0, striking out 14 and walking none. Three
runners reached 1B on errors. The Doves send up 3 righty pinch hitters
in the 9th to no avail. The 14 strikeouts tops the previous NL high this
season of 12, held by Rucker and Mathewson.

Washington and Walter Johnson top the Highlanders, 6-0, as the New Yorkers
manage just 4 hits.

Ed Reulbach allows just 4 Pittsburgh hits as Chicago romps, 11-0.

The first-place Giants roll over the Phils, 5-1, for their 7th straight
win. Mathewson is the winner over George McQuillan.

1910
After losing, 5-2, to the Yankees, the A's win the second game, 2-1, and
Jack Coombs begins a streak of 53 shutout innings, topping Doc White's 46
of 1904. Three years later Walter Johnson will top Coombs.

1913
The Phils score the only run this afternoon in a doubleheader in Boston. The
visitors win the opener, 1-0, then the two play 10 innings of scoreless
baseball before the game is called. Alexander misses his 20th win, but will
reach the mark in 3 days.

In the first game of a doubleheader between St. Louis and Pittsburgh, Max
Carey is awarded a triple in the bottom of the 5th inning when St. Louis
3B Mike Mowrey throws his glove and hits the ball that Carey hit over his
head. The Pirates prevail, winning 8-3 and 11-3 in 7 innings.

1914
Enroute to tossing a 9-0 shutout against the Toronto Maple Leafs,
19-year-old Babe Ruth of the AAA Providence Grays hits the first homerun in
his professional career (and his only minor league HR), a 3-run blast off
Ellis Johnson. The site of the "Sultan of Swat's" only minor-league homer,
Hanlan's Point Stadium which was located on Lake Ontario's Toronto Islands
near the city's mainland, is being promoted as a historical landmark by
Jerry Amernic, author of Gift of the Bambino.

1915
In the first game of a doubleheader versus the Tigers, the Browns' George
Sisler tosses 9 innings and gives up 6 runs, to lose 6-5. Sisler clubs a
HR in the loss.

1918
In order to cut down on the use of trains, the first 3 games of the WS
are played in Chicago, the next 3 in Boston. The Cubs switch their home
games to Comiskey Park with its larger seating capacity. Babe Ruth, having
completed 13 scoreless innings in his first WS 2 years ago, adds 9 more
(while 6 hits) in edging Hippo Vaughn, 1-0, in the opener. Also, when
2B Dave Shean bats for Boston, he becomes the oldest player (40 years,
3 months, 18 days) to play in the WS, a mark other graybeards will top.
During the 7th-inning stretch, a military band plays "The Star Spangled
Banner" and Red Sox player Fred Thomas, on leave from the Navy, snaps to
attention. From then on, the song is played at every WS game, every season
opener, and whenever a band is present to play it, though it is not yet
adopted as the national anthem. The custom of playing it before every game
will begin during WW II, when the installation of public address systems
makes it practical. The first time it is recorded that the song was played
at a ball game was on May 15, 1862, at the Union Grounds in Brooklyn. The
baseball game was led off by a band concert.

1919
The Red Sox pull off a triple play and bang out 25 hits in downing the A's,
15-7. Babe Ruth is 5 for 6 including his 25th homer, tying Buck Freeman's
record.

1920
Brooklyn retains its slim lead in the NL by trimming the visiting Braves,
2-1, behind Rube Marquard. It's the 3rd straight win at home.

1921
In the Labor Day afternoon game at Boston, won by the Red Sox 8-2, the Yankees
outfield makes a AL-record 5 assists, 4 by Bob Meusel. Meusel, with one of
the strongest arms in baseball, will lead the AL in assists in 1921 and 1922.

Walter Johnson breaks Cy Young's career strikeout mark by fanning 7 A's to
run his total to 2,287. But he loses to the A's Bob Hasty, 4-3. Washington
takes game 2, 7-1, behind George Mogridge.

Browns pitcher Urban Shocker takes his first loss after winning 9 in a
row. Elmer Smith's 2 HRs pace a 10-5 Indians win in the morning game to
back Guy Morton's pitching. In the afternoon game, a 12-8 St. Louis win,
Smith starts off with another one. Having hit one in Detroit the day before,
Smith has 7 straight extra base hits in 3 games - a ML record - for 22 total
bases (3 doubles, 4 HRs + 2 walks). Earl Sheehy, in 1926, will hit 7 long hits
in just 2 games - a ML record - but he will sandwich those around a sac fly.

At Los Angeles, the Angels (PCL) win a pair from Portland, 8-4 and 9-3. The
teams complete a 13-game series in seven days, with the Angels taking the
last 7 games in a row to win the series, 10-3. The Angels outscore the
Beavers in the series, 72-36. The series started the day after the purchase
of the Angels by William Wrigley Jr.

1922
The Browns take over 1st place by beating the Indians, 10-9, as Urban Shocker
wins his 23rd, in relief. He'll win no more. Ken Williams hits his 34th,
a grand slam.

1924
In Philadelphia, the Giants sweep 2 from the hapless Phils, winning 6-5
and 15-3. Harry Baldwin and Hugh McQuillan are the winners. George Kelly
and Travis Jackson hit grand slams in the game 2 rout. The Phils have now
lost 4 doubleheaders in 5 days.

1926
At Baltimore, the minor league Orioles embarrass the Yankees, 18-9, in an
exhibition game. Ruth is 0 for 5 and tangles with Mark Koenig in the dugout
after the 8th inning. Ruth yells at Koenig of loafing on several plays.

1927
In the first of two at Fenway, the Red Sox and Yankees battle for 18 innings
before the Red Sox emerge the winners, 12-11. Buddy Myers' double is followed
by a single from Ira Flagstead. New York scores a pair in the top of the
9th to tie, and then there is no scoring until the 17th when both teams
plate 3. Boston starter Red Ruffing, a future Yankee, goes 15 innings but
does not get a decision. Reliever Snake Wiltse is the winner over Waite
Hoyt. New York wins the abbreviated nitecap, 5-0, with Wiltse taking the loss.

Before a crowd of 58,000 at the Polo Grounds the Giants split a Labor Day
doubleheader with the Braves. Boston wins the opener, 6-1, with Braves
righty Charlie Robertson outpitching Virgil Barnes. The loss is the first
in 11 games for New York. The Giants win a 9-8 decision in the nitecap,
coming from behind on Jack Cummings' RBI double in the bottom of the
9th. The Giants end the day just a game in back of the leading Pirates,
but this will be the closest they come to the pennant.

1928
Boston sweeps today's twinbill with Brooklyn, winning the opener, 9-2. The
Robins collect 13 hits in the loss, but make 8 errors. The Braves are paced
by Sisler's four hits. Bob Smith pitches a 2-hitter to win the nitecap.

1929
Pittsburgh hammers Pirate-killer Red Lucas for 7 runs in the 3rd inning
and win, 10-5. Pitcher Erv Brame starts the scoring by bouncing a homer
into the RF bleachers, and the Bucs follow with a double, three triples,
two singles, and a wild throw. A Lloyd Waner triple, his 2nd, in the 4th
with a man on sends Red to the showers.

1930
The Braves win their 3rd in a row from the Giants, 6-4, to drop New York
to 3rd place in the NL, 6 games in back of Chicago. The idle Cards now are
in 2nd all alone.

1931
The Cardinals' lead drops to 5 1/2 as the 2nd-place Giants whip Brooklyn,
5-1 and 10-1. New York's Fred Fitzsimmons wins the opener, pitching 7
innings, giving up 3 hits and stroking a HR. In the 7th inning, Fitzsimmons
is struck on the head by a pitch from Austin Moore, which ruptures a blood
vessel and keeps the knuckleballer from making his next start.

In Cincinnati, the Cubs lose, 4-3 in 10 innings. Hack Wilson, in the Cubs'
dog house for drinking and not hitting, is left in the bull pen to warm
up pitchers when manager Hornsby, short of outfielders, inserts pitcher Bud
Teachout in LF. On the train back to Chicago that night, Wilson starts arguing
with two writers. When Pat Malone wanders by, he joins in the argument and,
with his encouragement, Wilson punches out both writers. Malone will be
fined $500 for his actions while club president Bill L. Veeck will suspend
Wilson without pay for the rest of the season. In 112 games, Wilson hit just
.261 with 13 HRs, and the Cubs will send the slumping slugger to St. Louis
over the winter.

At Boston, George Earnshaw loses a no-hitter in the 8th inning when Marty
McManus' roller gets away from SS Williams. Earnshaw ends with an 8-0
one-hitter. The A's lose the nitecap, 6-3, to Wilcey Moore.

1932
The Yankees take care of the second-place Athletics with a Labor Day
Doubleheader sweep, 8-6 and 6-3. New York leads the AL by 12 1/2 games.

1935
Rookie Terry Moore of the Cardinals goes 6 for 6 and the rest of the Cards
add another 12 hits to paste the Braves, 15-3.

The Cubs keep the pressure on by edging the Phils in 11 innings, 3-2,
on Frank Demaree's single. Charlie Root picks up the win.

Trailing the St. Louis Browns, 5-1, Lefty Grove is lifted for pinch-hitter
Wes Ferrell who hits a RBI single as the Red Sox score six runs in the 6th
inning enroute to 9-5 win. Grove is the winning pitcher.

1936
Boston tops the Yankees, 3-2, in the first game, and then comes back to
tie the 2nd, 7-7, in a game called because of darkness. The Red Sox are
helped in the nitecap by a triple play and 2 errors apiece by Joe DiMaggio
and Bill Dickey.

1938
For the third time this season, Dodger catcher Babe Phelps breaks a bone
in his throwing hand. Although the injuries will limit his playing time to
only 66 games and 208 at-bats this season, the southpaw-swinging backstop
will hit .308 and was named to the National League All-Star team, the first
of three consecutive games he'll play in the Mid-summer classic.

In Pittsburgh, the Cubs sweep a Labor Day doubleheader from the leading
Pirates, winning 3-0 behind Bill Lee and 4-3 in back of Clay Bryant to move
4 games behind to the leaders. Brandt and Tobin take the losses for the Bucs.

1940
Before the start of their game with the Dodgers, the Phillies honor Chuck
Klein, and present The Clouting Kraut with a box of coins and a ham. The
Dodgers then present the Phils with an 8-5 loss.

1943
Attempting to tie the 1912 Giants ML record of winning 14 straight series, the
Yankees drop two to the Senators, earning just a four-game-split. Washington
takes the opener, 3-2, behind Dutch Leonard and rookie Charlie Roberts
lines an inside-the-park homer in the 8th to break a 2-2 tie; it is his
first ML homerun. In the second game, Bobo Newsom departs in the 5th with
a sore stomach but takes a 2-1 lead. Sherry Robertson hits a 3-run HR and
the Senators win, 5-1.

1944
Cooper and Walters each reach the 20-victory mark as each pitch duplicate
6-hit 4-0 shutouts. The Cards win the opener and the Reds take the nitecap.

1945
On Honus Wagner Night in Pittsburgh, the Dodgers spoil the party by winning,
5-3 in 10 innings, on Goody Rosen's 2-run homer.

1946
The Tigers jump on an overworked Bob Feller, chasing him with 9 runs in
the 4th inning. The highlight is Hank Greenberg 30th homer, a three-run
shot. Fred Hutchinson wins, 10-0.

1948
The Braves' Red Barrett allows 5 hits in beating the Phils, 5-1. Frank
McCormick drives in three runs.

DiMaggio hits his 4th homer of the series to help the Yanks top the Senators,
5-3. With the score deadlocked at 3-3 in the 6th, Joe D ducks out of the
way of a Sid Hudson brushback pitch and the ball hits his bat, dropping
into RF for a double to start the 2-run rally.

Ted Williams collects 4 hits as the Red Sox top the A's, 4-3 in 10
innings. The Sox and Yankees have each won 19 of their last 22 games.

Amarillo (West Texas-New Mexico League) OF Bob Crues hits 2 HRs against
Lubbock to give him 69 for the season, tying Joe Hauser's 1933 mark at
Minneapolis. He sets an organized baseball record with 254 RBIs in 140 games,
hits a record 8 grand slams, while hitting .404.

1949
Before 32,844 fans in Philadelphia, the Yankees sweep a holiday twinbill from
the A's, winning 13-4 and 5-2. Raschi easily wins his 18th in the opener as
DiMaggio drives in 5 runs, 4 on a grand slam off Lou Brissie. Billy Johnson
follows with his 8th homer of the year. In the nitecap, DiMaggio leaves in
the 2nd inning with leg cramps, but the Yankees win behind Tommy Byrne and
Joe Page in a game called after 7 innings because of darkness. The Yankees
return to NYC having won 8 of 14 road games, but have just 4 away games in
their remaining 25. New York is 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston.

1950
The Yankees acquire 1B Johnny Hopp, who is 2nd in the NL in hitting with
a .340 mark, from the Pirates for an undisclosed amount of cash. The Yanks
believe Hopp will provide late season pennant insurance.

Phils lefty Curt Simmons is the first player inducted into the Army as a
result of the Korean conflict. He will get one more start before reporting.

Purdue Athletic Director Red Mackey criticizes the Yankees for signing his
19-year-old star P/SS Bill Skowron, who was also expected to be the starting
right halfback on the Boilermakers' football squad.

1951
After a day off, the Giants sweep two games in Boston, winning 3-2
and 9-1. In the opener, Sheldon Jones scatters six hits to beat Warren
Spahn. Spahn allows just 5 hits in his attempt to become the NL's first
19-game winner. The Giants tally 13 hits in the second game to help Sal
Maglie win his first-ever victory against Boston.

Ralph Branca, despite twinges in his arm, pitches the Dodgers to a 5-2 win
over the Phillies. Gil Hodges drives home 4 runs on a grand slam off Ken
Johnson. It is Gil's 37th homer of year, setting a new Dodger record.

The A's Ferris Fain goes 5 for 5 in the 2nd game of a doubleheader with
Washington, as the A's sweep a pair, 4-1 and 9-7. Fain is 6 for 9 and is
hitting .341.

1952
Raul Sanchez of the Senators pitches a 2-0 whitewash against the Red Sox in
the first start of his career. It is the 2nd shutout in 4 days for a Nats'
Cuban rookie making his first start. Until this week both Sanchez and Mike
Fornieles, the other rookie pitcher, were playing for Havana.

Vinegar Bend Mizell strikes out 11 batters in topping the Pirates,
4-0. Pittsburgh's 18-year-old Bill Bell, a triple-no-hit winner in Class D,
loses in his major-league debut. Rookie Vinegar Bend Mizell extends the
Redbirds' consecutive scoreless innings pitched to 25 with the win.

Luke Easter clouts a 3-run homer and Early Wynn wins his 19th, 3-0 over
the White Sox. Cleveland now trails the Yankees by 2 1/2 games.

Clint Hartung's 2-run pinch blast in the 8th lifts the Giants to a 5-4 win
over the Phils. Bobby Thomson also connects to back Al Corwin's win. The
Giants are 6 games in back of the Dodgers as the two teams start their series.

1953
Dick Kokos breaks up a scoreless pitching duel between Bob Turley and
Ralph Branca by hitting a homer in the 12th to give the Browns a 1-0 win
over Detroit.

1954
With Dittmer and Mathews clouting 2 homers apiece, the Braves outslug to
Reds in both games to win 11-8 and 9-7. Hank Aaron goes 5 for 5 for the day
but breaks his ankle in the 2nd game while sliding into 3B on a triple. He
is lost for the remainder of the season. Spahn starts the first game and
goes 5 1/3 innings and then relieves in game 2. He gives up a 3-run HR to
Kluszewski in game 2, which puts the Reds ahead 7-1, but the Braves roar back
to give Spahnie his 18th win. The homer, the first baseman's 44th overall,
is the 34th round-tripper he has hit at Crosley Field, making it the most
ever hit in one season by one man in the same ballpark, a mark which will
stand until Sammy Sosa eclipses it in 1998 at Wrigley Field.

Joe Bauman of the Roswell Rockets (Class C Longhorn League) clouts his 70th,
71st, and 72nd homers, an organized ball record. He ends the season with
a .400 batting average, .916 slugging average and 224 RBIs. Although the
32-year-old slugging minor league first baseman never made it to the majors,
his homerun total stood as a record in professional baseball until it was
broken in 2001 with 73 dingers by Giants outfielder Barry Bonds.

1955
In an 11-4 win over the Phillies, Dodger pitcher Don Newcombe hits his
seventh homer establishing a National League record for homeruns by a
pitcher in a season. The victory is Newk's 20th of the season.

1956
The Reds pound Warren Spahn and beat the Braves, 12-2, to move to 1 1/2
games off the lead. The Reds take 3 out of 4 in the crucial series.

1957
Stengel allows pitcher Bob Grim to hit with 2 out and 2 on in the bottom
of the 9th, and Grim comes through with his first hit of the season, a
3-run game-ending homerun. The Yankees beat the Red Sox, 5-2. Russ Nixon
takes the loss. Tomorrow a game-ending HR is hit by Dixie Howell for the
Chicago White Sox against the Kansas City Athletics marking the only time
a walk-off homerun is hit in consecutive days by a pitcher.

Minor league baseball in Los Angeles comes to an end as the Hollywood Stars
close out their season with a 6-0 win over the San Francisco Seals. A friendly
crowd of 6,354 is on hand at Gilmore Field to watch Jayne Mansfield, Miss
Hollywood Stars, present president Bob Cobb with a new car before the game.

1958
At St. Louis, the Dodgers manage only 3 hits but bunch the safeties in the
2nd inning off Mizell to win, 2-1. In the 8th with 2 outs, Junior Gilliam
tries to steal home on a 3-1 pitch to Hodges, but he is tagged out on what is
called a ball ... Hodges, though he is credited with a walk, never goes to 1B.

At Pittsburgh, Bill Virdon hits a 10th-inning HR to break up a brilliant
pitching duel between the Braves' Carlton Willey and Red Witt. The Pirates
win, 1-0.

1959
Jim Lemon of Washington knocks in 6 runs in the 3rd inning, on 2 HRs,
tying 2 ML records. Washington scores 10 in the inning to triumph over
Cleveland, 14-2.

1960
At Forbes Field, the first-place Pirates split with the Braves, winning 9-7
before losing, 7-1. The Bucs rout Spahn in the opener scoring 7 runs in the
4th after the Braves had knocked out starter Bob Friend. Bob Buhl is the
winner in the nitecap, scattering 7 hits. Chuck Cottier has 3 doubles and
3 RBIs to back Buhl. Haddix is the loser and gives way to Diomedes Olivo,
who makes his ML debut in relief. At age 41, or thereabouts, Olivo is the
oldest rookie in NL history (and the oldest in ML history except for Satchel
Paige). The IL MVP pitches 2 runless innings.

1961
Los Angeles' Lee Thomas ties the ML record with 9 hits in a doubleheader,
5 in the first game and 4, including 3 HRs, in the 2nd. Thomas ties the
AL record with 19 total bases in a doubleheader. But Kansas City wins both
games from the Angels, 7-3 and 13-12.

The Yanks top Washington, 6-1, sending the Senators to their 20th defeat
in their last 21 games. Mantle homers for his 51st. The Yanks' win, coupled
with a Detroit doubleheader loss, puts New York ahead by 7 1/2 games.

1962
Ken Hubbs of the Cubs sets ML records at 2B for consecutive games without
an error (78) and consecutive chances accepted (418) without an error. His
streak ends with a 4th-inning throwing error as Cincinnati beats Chicago, 4-1.

Washington's John Kennedy pinch hits against the Twins and becomes the 9th AL
player to debut with a HR in his first at-bat. His blow breaks up a no-hit
bid by Dick Stigman, and the Nats rally to tie the game at 7-7 in the 9th,
The Twins win, 9-7, in 11 frames, then drop the nitecap, 3-0, as Claude Osteen
fires a 3 hitter. The split leaves the Twins 2 1/2 games behind the Yankees.

1963
Willie McCovey hits his 100th career homerun.

1964
Blue Moon Odom makes his ML debut, and Mickey Mantle greets him with a
3-run opposite field homer in the first inning. New York hangs on to win,
again by a 9-7 score.

Ernie Banks belts a double and a homer in the same inning, and the Cubs use
the big score to beat the Cards, 8-5. Mike Cuellar takes the loss against
Larry Jackson.

Sound familiar? The Yanks acquire veteran P Pedro Ramos from the Indians
as pennant insurance. The Indians get 2 players to be named later: Ralph
Terry on October 12, and Bud Daley on November 27.

1965
The Reds edge the Phillies, 10-9, despite the slugging of Phils first
sacker Dick Stuart. Stuart clouts a grand slam, the 9th of his career,
in the 1st inning, then hits a 2-run homer in the 7th.

1968
Gene Mauch is named manager of the new Montreal NL club, which is officially
named the Expos.

1969
Tom Seaver becomes the first pitcher in franchise history to win 20 games
in one season when the Mets beat the Phillies at Shea Stadium, 5-1. 'Tom
Terrific', who will finish the season with a 25-7 record for the world
champs, tosses a five-hit complete game to reach the milestone.

Billy Williams has all 4 of Chicago's hits, as the Cubs lose a 9-2 decision
to Steve Blass and the Pirates. There's nothing cheap about Billy's hits -
two doubles and two homers - as he sets an NL record for most hits in a
game with no other hits, tying the ML record of Norm Elberfeld (August 1,
1903). Blass helps his own cause with his only ML homer, a 3-run blast,
off Ken Holtzman, and 3 singles. The win is Pittsburgh's first at Wrigley
since July 5, 1968, a string of 13 losses. They'll win the next 2 to sweep
the series and drop the Cubs lead to 2 1/2 games.

1971
In his major league debut, J.R. Richard throws a complete game in the
Astros' 5-3 victory over San Francisco at Candlestick Park. The 21-year-old
right-handed fireballer strikes out a major-league rookie record 15 batters
in his first major league appearance.

The Tigers tie a ML record by using 6 pinch hitters in the 7th inning,
but lose, 6-5, to the Yankees anyway.

Cardinal pitcher Jerry Reuss is a winner, 12-5, in a duel with Chicago's
Fergie Jenkins. Jenkins gives up a HR to Matty Alou in the contest and now
all 3 Alou brothers have hit dingers off him.

1972
Felix Milan is 5 for 5 in the Braves' 5-3 win over the Astros.

1974
Milwaukee hands Boston its 7th straight loss as rookie Gorman Thomas hits
a 2-run shot in the 9th inning. It was Thomas' first game of the year for
Milwaukee after hitting 51 homers for Sacramento (PCL) this year. Billy
Champion (10-3) picks up the win for the 5th-place Brewers.

1975
Mets C Jerry Grote ties the modern ML record by reaching base on errors 3
times during a 5-2 win over the Cardinals.

Montreal and Pittsburgh use a ML record 15 pinch hitters in their doubleheader
split. The Expos take the opener, 4-3 in 10 innings, and Pittsburgh wins

Jose Morales to follow him home. Morales arrives there ahead of Ford,
who is out for being passed on the bases.

The Expos beat the Cubs, 10-8, in a 9-inning game that sees a ML record 45
players participate.

1979
Just one defeat shy of the American League record, A's starting pitcher Matt
Keough snaps his eighteen-game consecutive losing streak, which includes
four losses at the end of last season. The 24-year-old right-hander tosses
