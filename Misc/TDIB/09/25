1901
The first-place Pirates jump on Christy Mathewson for 3 runs in the first
inning on their way to a 10-5 win over the Giants. The Bucs tally 14 hits
off Matty to whip the visiting Giants.

At Boston, Cy Young wins his 33rd, beating the White Stockings, 5-2. Nixey
Callahan takes the loss.

1905
After losing 3 in Chicago, the Giants open a critical series in Pittsburgh
by winning, 10-4, behind Mathewson's 30th victory. The Giants score 5 runs
in the 1st inning on just one hit. Deacon Phillippe hits a record-tying 3
batters in the frame and Honus Wagner adds a throwing error. New York now
leads by 6 1/2 games.

1906
The Cubs' Jack Pfiester allows just one hit - a 2-out 8th-inning single by
Bergen - in beating host Brooklyn, 1-0, in 10 innings. Elmer Stricklett, "the
expert of the salvitory slings" (Chicago Tribune), matches scoreless innings
until Schulte hits a 2-out double in the 10th and scores on Hofman's single.

1907
In a game against the Giants, Pirates third baseman Honus Wagner swipes four
bases, including second, third and home in the second inning. Outfielder
Fred Clarke also has four stolen bases for Pittsburgh.

1908
Detroit's Ed Summers pitches two complete-game wins over the A's, winning
the opener, 7-2. The 2nd game is a 10-inning battle with another rookie Bill
Schlitzer that ends 1-0 on a Claude Rossman drive for an inside-the-park
homerun. Summers allows just 2 hits. With the White Sox idle, the Tigers
move to a half-game out of first.

The Senators score 5 runs in the 9th inning off Cleveland righthander
Charlie Chech and beat the Naps, 6-1. Former Cleveland owner Frank DeHaas
Robison, listening on the telephone to a friend's play-by-play account of the
Washington rally collapses with a heart attack. He dies several hours later.

At the Polo Grounds, Rube Marquard makes his ML debut and the Reds rough
up the Giants $18,000 rookie for 7 hits and 5 runs in 5 innings. The Reds
win, 7-1.

1909
The White Sox sweep a pair from the Senators, 2-1, and 2-0. In game one,
Washington rookie Bob Groom loses his 15th consecutive game, an AL record
that will be surpassed by John Nabors (1916) and Mike Parrott (1980) He
will lead the AL with 26 losses. Walter Johnson is the loser in game two
as Bill Burns shuts out the Sox.

At Chicago, Cubs P Jack Pfiester beats Boston, 7-4, for his 11th straight
win over them stretching back to August 26, 1907.

At Philadelphia, the A's tally two shutouts over Cleveland, winning 5-0
behind Chief Bender and 3-0 behind veteran Cy Morgan.

The Yankees' eight-game winning streak halts against the visiting Tigers
pitcher Ed Summers, 2-1, in the first game of a doubleheader. They also lose
the second game, 10-4. The Yanks hit Summers freely across the first three
innings with the help of a signal-stealing scheme. A hat advertisement in
CF has the crossbar in "H" cut and painted white on one side and black on
the other. Using a telescope, a man spotted the catcher's signal and used
a handle to flip the crossbar to indicate fastball or curve. Tigers manager
Hughey Jennings sent the team trainer to investigate. He discovers the scam
and destroys the crossbar. Jennings wasn't the only manager to suspect the
Yankees were swiping signs. Chicago White Sox manager Billy Sullivan later
claimed that he had suspicions, but couldn't prove anything. Joe Cantillon,
manager of the Senators, also claimed he was aware of the practice, but
didn't complain because his team was out of the race. He identified the
man in CF as former pitcher Gene McCann. Later, at the winter meetings
the American League board of directors issues a statement saying that
"after their investigation, they found no evidence a signal tipping plan
had been in effect." The statement also declared that "if such a plan was
discovered from any team in the league the manager or player responsible
would be banned from the league for all time." A rule prohibiting signal
tipping will be implemented the following year.

1910
At Chicago's South Side Grounds, Ed Walsh attempts to run the White Sox
victory-streak to 10 games in the first game of a doubleheader against the
A's. Walsh allows one hit through 8 innings while Ed Plank is nearly as good,
surrendering three hits. The A's tie the game in the 9th when Jack Coombs
relieves to pitch five scoreless innings as the A's prevail, 3-1 in 14. Harry
Lord has four of the five Sox hits. Coombs, with his consecutive scoreless
innings streak now at 52 innings, starts game two. He allows a leadoff triple
in the 1st inning but escapes without Chicago scoring. However, the Sox tally
three in the 2nd ending Coombs' streak at 53 innings. Chicago wins, 5-2,
in five innings when the game is called on account of darkness. Harry Lord
steals 3B and then swipes home on the front end of a double steal for the Sox.

At St. Louis, the Browns and Senators split with the Browns winning game one,
2-1. In the second game, Walter Johnson tosses the first of his two career
one-baserunner games, missing a perfect game when a sixth-inning grounder
by rookie Frank Truesdale skips by SS George McBride for a single. Johnson's
one-hitter is good for a 3-0 victory over the Browns. Johnson strikes out 11
to run his season total to 303, "establishing a new world strikeout record
beating Rube Waddell's mark of 301 set in 1903." (Chicago Tribune). However,
Waddell's mark is now recognized as 349.

1911
Washington's Wid Conroy, in his final season, sets an AL record for total
chances by a 3B with 13 in a 3-2 loss to Cleveland.

John C. Bender, brother of Philadelphia great Chief Bender, dies on the mound
during a game played in Edmonton, Alberta. Bender, 30, dies of a heart attack.

Boston ace strikes out 10 in winning his 33rd game.

1916
The Giants push their record win streak to 21 games by clipping the Cardinals,
1-0 and 6-2. The old record was set in 1884 when Providence won 20 straight.

Boston's Babe Ruth is 2 for 3 and shuts out Cleveland, 2-0, on 7 hits.

1917
The Cards beat the Series-bound Giants, 5-3. Ross Youngs debuts for the
Giants, and the future Hall of Famer is 0 for 4.

1919
In Detroit, the Tigers, fighting for 3rd place, use 18 hits to beat the
Indians, 9-5. The Indians have already clinched 2nd place. Ty Cobb is 1 for
4 while Tris Speaker has three hits, including two triples. Cobb will later
write a letter to Detroit P Dutch Leonard in which he implies there was a
"business proposition" involving this game that was "disappointing." Neither
Cobb or Speaker was ever proven to have bet on this or any other games,
but Leonard will later accuse the two of arranging for the Tigers to win
today. Commissioner Landis will exonerate the pair in 1927.

1920
Behind Shoeless Joe Jackson's homer and 2 doubles and the pitching of Claude
Williams, the White Sox beat host Cleveland, 5-1, to shave the Indians'
lead down to a 1/2 game. Jackson is hitting .387.

The A's lose their 100th game, falling to the Red Sox, 4-2. Dugan has 3
doubles, and finishes the series with 7 two-base hits.

1921
At the Polo Grounds, 38,000 watch the Yankees thrash the 2nd place Indians,
21-7, to move a full game ahead of the Tribe. The Yanks knock out Caldwell in
the 2nd and dust Mails for 10 runs in his 2 innings. In the 4th the Yankees
bat around without an out being recorded. The 10th batter Peck singles for
his 2nd hit of the inning, as manager Speaker watches from CF. Bob Meusel
as a triple with 2 on and a homer with 2 on to pace the 20-hit offense. Carl
Mays has 3 hits and goes the distance for the win.

pennant and the Giants' 10th in 41 years in the NL.

1923
Rogers Hornsby is fined $500 and suspended indefinitely by the Cardinals when,
feeling ill, he refuses to take the field for a game against the Robins,
despite the team doctor's opinion that he is in condition to play. Raj is
not needed as Haines tops Brooklyn, 4-1, for his 20th win.

Pittsburgh wins, 18-5, over the Phillies as rookie Eddie Moore scores 5
runs in his ML debut.

1925
The Reds tie the NL record of 2 teammates hitting bases-loaded triples in the
same game. Reds catcher Walker, in the 3rd, and Bressler in the 5th connect
at home in the 18-7 win over Brooklyn. Jakie May is the winning pitcher before
just 534 fans at Redlands Field. The A's will accomplish the feat next season.

1926
The Yankees take two from the Browns to nail down the AL flag, winning the
opener, 10-2, behind Herb Pennock. Ruth's grand slam is the big blow. In
the nitecap, Gehrig homers in the 3rd inning, off Milt Gaston, while Ruth
matches him with a 2-run HR in the 6th off Win Ballou. Ruth adds a solo shot
in the 9th, his 46th, off Joe Giard to seal the Waite Hoyt 10-4 victory. Ruth
has 4 RBIs in each game, though his official scorecard somehow lists him at
two apiece ... the incorrect total will not be noted until researcher Trent
McCotter discovers it in 2004, and it raises his RBI total for the year to
150, not 146, which is his official total. Despite the score, the second
game is played in a new AL-record 55 minutes. The NL record is 51 minutes,
on September 28, 1919.

In the first of two games in Chicago, Sox RF Bill Barrett breaks a 1-1
tie with a 9th-inning solo homer off Washington's Walter Johnson to give
the win to Tommy Thomas, 2-1. The Senators take the 2nd game, 3-2, behind
Firpo Marberry.

In Boston, the Pirates release veteran Stuffy McInnis so that he can return
to his home nearby. McInnis is credited with telling reporters about a team
vote that was taken regarding whether veep Fred Clarke should be asked to
quit the bench. When word got out it was assumed that McInnis' days were
numbered. The vote resulted in the release of veterans Babe Adams and Carson
Bigbee, and Max Carey being waived to Brooklyn on August 13.

1927
The Cardinals win 2 to move into 2nd, while the Pirates take 2 from Chicago.

John McGraw returns to the Giants' dugout, but the Giants manage no better
than a 7-inning tie against the Dodgers.

1929
Three days after turning the team over to coach Art Fletcher, Yankee
manager Miller Huggins dies from blood poisoning at New York's St. Vincent
Hospital. He was 49. The team finds out about the death during the 5th
inning at Fenway Park and both teams line up at home plate for a minute of
silent prayer. New York wins the game, 11-10 in 11 innings, as starters Ray
Dobens and Bots Nekola, teammates at Holy Cross a year ago, are gone after 6
innings. Tony Lazzeri is the hitting star with a single, double and 2 triples.

1930
Joe McCarthy, not receiving the support of Cubs owner William Wrigley,
resigns as manager. Rogers Hornsby is named to finish the season and manage

next month.

Harry Hooper, former Red Sox and White Sox star OF, is named baseball coach
at Princeton University.

Cards are now 7-12 vs. the Bucs and lead the Cubs by 3 games.

1931
The A's 19-year-old rookie Lew Krausse makes his ML debut a dandy one,
twirling a 4-hitter to beat Boston, 7-1.

Sam Rice drops a fly ball and the Yankees rally for 5 runs in the 8th to
beat the Senators, 8-3. Ruth has two solo homers to help in the win. The
3rd-place Yanks now trail the Nats by a 1/2 game.

1932
Paul Waner sets a new NL record with his 62nd double, as the Pirates
defeat the Cardinals, 7-1. The 2nd place Pirates will be the first team to
finish above .500 (86-68) while scoring fewer runs (701 to 711) than their
opponents. The NL won't see it again in a full season until the 1984 Mets,
while it won't happen in the AL until 1948.

Jimmie Foxx hits his 58th HR in the last game of the season to finish 2
short of Ruth's 1927 record of 60. Foxx adds two singles but the A's lose,
2-1, to the Senators' Alvin Crowder. Crowder wins his 26th and 15th straight
game, one short of the AL record held by Walter Johnson, Smoky Joe Wood and
Lefty Grove. Foxx finishes with 169 RBIs while teammate Al Simmons ties for
2nd with 151. The Athletics set a since-topped ML record of 172 homeruns
in a single season.

1933
In a closed practice, the Series-bound Senators test the less-lively NL
ball. Joe Cronin finds it "rides plenty," hitting 3 of the first 4 pitches
into the stands. "I'm in the wrong league," he says.

The Giants travel to Ossining for a 9-3 win over the Sing Sing prison
team. Alabama Pitts, the prison's football star, has two doubles in the
7-inning game. Pitts will be offered a baseball contract in May of 1935,
but later the offer will be rescinded after a public uproar.

1934
In his first major league game, Yankee Vito Tamulis shuts out the A's,
5-0. Lou Gehrig plays his 1,500th consecutive game and hits his 48th HR,
a personal high.

In his first ML game, Cubs rookie Phil Cavarretta, a Chicago native, homers
off Hank Wistert to give the Cubs' Guy Bush a 1-0 win over the Reds. The
teenager also has 2 walks, a stolen base, and handles 12 chances cleanly
at 1B. Signed by Peoria last winter, the Cubs picked him when the Three I
league disbanded in mid-summer.

Diz wins his 28th, beating the Pirates, 3-2, and blanking the Bucs until
the 9th inning when Vaughan belts a 2-run HR. The Giants' lead over the
Birds is cut to one game when the Phillies rally in the 9th for a 5-4 win.

The Los Angeles Angels set a PCL record by executing double plays in the
first six innings of a 7-2 win over visiting Seattle.

1935
In a showdown series with the 2nd-place Cardinals in St. Louis, the Cubs
edge the Cardinals, 1-0. Paul Dean strikes out the first 4 Cub batters
before young Phil Cavarretta drives a homerun on top of the roof in RF for
the only score of the game. Lon Warneke gives up just 2 hits and walks none
in winning his 20th game. It is the Cubs' 19th straight win, and they are
now assured of at least a tie for the pennant.

At Cleveland the Indians edge the Tigers, 3-2, garnering 10 hits. Joe Vosmik,
leading the AL in hitting, has 3 hits, as does Hal Trosky, batting righty
against the lefty Elon Hogsett. Chief Hogsett took over in the 1st inning
when starter Auker was hit on the wrist by a line drive off the bat of
Vosmik. Hogsett accounts for one run with a 6th-inning solo homer over the
RF wall of League Park.

1936

Reds. Red Lucas is the winner over Paul Derringer.

1939
Johnny Cooney hits his 2nd homer in two days, a third-inning HR off Giants

1940
Walker Cooper, recently called up from Columbus (AA), and Mort Cooper,
pitching in relief, make up a brother battery in the Cards' 4-3 win over the

hits are by Enos Slaughter.

The Indians' Al Milnar stops the Browns, 4-2, his 5th straight win over
St. Louis.

In Detroit, Bobo Newsom wins a clutch doubleheader for the Tigers, pitching
2 innings of relief in the opener against the White Sox for his 20th
win. Detroit wins, 10-9 in 10 innings, on Rudy York's double. Bobo goes
the distance in the nightcap for his 21st win, a 3-2 triumph. Greenberg
contributes his 41st homer and 150th RBI in the 2nd game. Detroit now leads
by 2 games.

In Chicago's 2-1 and 6-4 sweep over the Pirates, Debs Garms takes over in
LF in game 2 for the Bucs. For Garms, who was 0 for 5 in game 1, it is his
100th game, qualifying him for the batting title. Garms will play in 103
games and lead the NL in hitting with a .355 average in 358 at-bats. The
NL ruled in early September that there was no rule stating that a player
had to be up 400 times to qualify for the title and 100 games would qualify.

1941
Whitlow Wyatt throws a 5-hit shutout to stop the Braves, 6-0. Bama Rowell,
Boston 2B, helps by making 3 errors in the 3rd inning, tying the NL mark.
Pete Reiser HRs for Brooklyn. As Wyatt takes the mound in the 9th, the
scoreboard flashes the news that the Pirates had beaten the Cards. He
completes the inning with 9 pitches and the Dodgers clinch their first
pennant in 21 years. For Wyatt, it is his 22nd victory. The Dodgers have a
wild celebration on the train ride back from Boston and, reaching New York,
they are greeted by thousands of jubilant fans at Grand Central Station.

The Pirates top the Cardinals, 3-1, scoring two runs on Elbie Fletcher's
inside-the-park homer. Rookie SS Billy Cox scores another after hitting
a triple.

At Crosley Field, Ray Starr two-hits the Cubs to win, 6-0.

1942
With the Giants' 3rd-place finish secure, OF Hank Lieber pitches a
complete-game 9-1 loss against the Phillies at the Polo Grounds. He yields
9 hits and strikes out 5 in his only ML pitching appearance. He had been
a pitcher at the U. of Arizona. The Phils score 5 of their runs without a
hit. The Giants take the opener, 6-3, behind Hal Schumacher.

1943
The Yankees clinch the AL flag with a 2-1 win over the Tigers in 14 innings.

1944
Going into the final Monday of the season, the Tigers hold a one-game lead
over the Browns with the Yankees now out of the running. Nelson Potter
stops the Red Sox, 3-0, and Russ Christopher of the A's beats the Tigers,
2-1, to produce a tie for the lead.

1946
In a loss that will haunt the Dodgers at the season's end, the Phils score
5 in the 9th to beat Brooklyn, 11-9. Leo Durocher sends in eight pitchers
in an effort to stave off the final Phils' rally, setting an NL record and
tying the ML mark (Washington vs. Boston, in an end of the season farce
game, October 4, 1913). In the first inning, Eddie Stanky cashes his 133rd
walk, off Oscar Judd, but the pitcher ties the score in the 3rd with his
only homer of the year, and drives in two more in the 4th off reliever Hal
Gregg. Brooklyn scores three in the bottom of the 3rd when 2B Emil Verban
makes two errors, and Phils 1B Frank McCormick makes his first error of
the season after a ML-record 131 straight errorless games. Ron Northey also
misjudges a fly ball into a double by Bruce Edwards. In the 8th inning, Dodger
pitcher Hank Behrman throws an inside pitch to Del Ennis, striking the young
slugger on the wrist. Ennis retires with a possible broken wrist and the
enraged Quakers charge it was deliberate. Two more singles chase Behrman
and it is 9-6 going into the 9th. A walk, strikeout, and bad hop single
brings in reliever Vic Lombardi. A single and walk brings in Art Herring,
the 7th Dodger pitcher, who throws 4 balls to Frank McCormick and leaves.
Kirby Higbe enters with the score tied, and Dee Moore's long fly scores
Johnny Wyrostek to make the score 10-9. Emil Verban's double drives in the
last run to make Tom Hughes the winner over Lombardi.

The Reds' Bucky Walters blanks the Cardinals, 6-0, but St. Louis stays a
game in front of Brooklyn.

Come on down! Bill Veeck offers free admission to the fans and 12,600 show
up. The White Sox throw a damper on the party by beating the Indians, 4-1.

Handling 13 chances without an error against the Braves in an 8-0 loss,
Giants SS Buddy Kerr runs his errorless streak to 254 chances, breaking
Eddie Miller's 1940 record.

1947
Giants rookie Larry Jansen wins his 21st game of the season, beating the
Braves' Red Barrett, 2-1. It is Jansen's 10th win in a row, all complete
games.

1948
Boston's Jack Kramer scatters seven hits and the Sox beat up on Allie
Reynolds, sending the Chief to the showers in the 4th inning. The Red Sox
win, 7-2.

Behind Gene Bearden's 17th win, the Indians top the Tigers, 9-3.

The Giants' Sheldon Jones allows 12 hits, including a homer by Jeff Heath,
but still beats the Braves, 3-2. Jones drives in two runs with two hits to
beat Sain. Heath has hit a homerun in every NL park this season, something
he did in the AL in 1946 and 1947 with the Browns. He is the first player
to do it in both leagues. Mize will join him in 1952.

1949
The Cardinals, in first place for 2 months, win their final home game, 6-1,
over the Cubs, and the Dodgers lose, 5-3, to Philadelphia, stretching the
Cards to a 1 1/2 game lead. WP Harry Brecheen collects 4 of the 12 safeties
for the Birds as they rout their old nemesis Johnny Schmitz.

Despite 71 injuries that kept players out of games, Casey Stengel and his
Yankees have been in first place all season. But today the Red Sox (93-55)
move into a tie for first place with a 4-1 victory over Allie Reynolds. Ted
Williams hits his 43rd HR, and Mel Parnell allows just 4 hits in winning his
25th game of the season. The lefty is 16-3 at Fenway this year, while the Red
Sox have won their last 21 games at home. Joe DiMaggio listens to the game
from a hospital, bedridden with pneumonia. The Yankees return to New York
and are greeted at Grand Central Station by a huge crowd of fans, including
Mrs. Babe Ruth, who predicts, "Whoever wins tomorrow should go all the way."

At Cleveland, the 3rd place Indians beat Detroit, 7-1, but the biggest
cheers from the 34,000 fans are for flagpole sitter Charley Lupica, who
finally descends from his perch. Lupica had been atop the flagpole since
the Indians were in 7th place and vowed to stay there until the Indians
were first or out of contention.

1950
Both Mel Parnell and rookie Harry Taylor of the Red Sox shutout Philadelphia,
winning 8-0 and 3-0. Parnell throws a 3-hitter, and Taylor allows only 2
hits in the nightcap to win his first ML game.

1951
The Dodgers continue to slide. After the Dodgers lose 2 out of 3 in
Philadelphia, Boston sweeps 2 from Brooklyn. Warren Spahn wins the opener,
6-3, over Branca, his 4th straight loss, and Jim Wilson coasts to a 14-2
three-hit win in the 2nd game. Earl Torgeson drives in 6 runs in the
nitecap. Meanwhile, the Giants win, 5-1, over Robin Roberts and the Phils
to move a single game in back of the Dodgers.

At Crosley Field, Reds catcher Johnny Pramesa clouts a grand slam in the
14th inning to defeat the Cardinals, 7-3.

1952
Hal Newhouser of the Tigers wins his 200th game, defeating the Browns,
3-2. Newhouser goes the distance, allowing 6 hits. It is his last win for
Detroit, who will release him in early 1953.

At New York, Robin Roberts wins his 28th, the most in the NL since Dean
in 1935. The Phils ace stops the Giants, 7-4, completing his 30th game in
37 starts.

1953
Bob Porterfield, named TSN's pitcher of the year, posts his 22nd win and
9th shutout in hurling the Nats to a 1-0 win over the A's. Three singles
in the 9th beats Fricano.

At Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox win, 5-0, behind Mel Parnell's 4th shutout
of the Yankees this year. It is the lefty's 21st win and his 5th this year
against New York.

1954
A crowd of 14,175 Fenway faithful fans pay tribute to retiring Red Sox
outfielder Ted Williams who is playing his last game at home. The 'Splendid
Splinter's retirement will only last until May when his divorce is finalized
with his contract being excluded from the settlement.

Duke Snider joins teammate Gil Hodges in the 40-HR club, giving the Dodgers
two 40-HR sluggers in 2 straight seasons. The Dodgers win, 10-5, over
Pittsburgh, as the sluggers drive in 3 runs apiece. Erskine wins his 18th.

Early Wynn takes a no-hitter into the 9th before allowing two hits in
beating the Tigers' George Zuverink, 11-1. It is his league-leading 23rd
win as the Indians notch their 111th victory, a new AL record eclipsing
the 110 wins of the 1927 Yankees.

Making his first ML pitching appearance, Al Lary, along with reliever Jim
Davis, hold the Reds to 3 hits as the Cubs win, 4-2. Hank Sauer belts a 2-run
HR. For Al Lary, it is his cup of coffee (he pinch ran on the 6th), and he
won't be back in the majors till 1962. His younger brother Frank debuted
on September 14 in a 1-inning mop-up in Detroit's 11-0 loss to the Yankees.

Although they lose 100 games, the same as in the previous season when the
club was in St. Louis, the Orioles draw over a million fans. Billy Pierce pins
the 100th loss on the O's, allowing 5 hits in the White Sox' 11-0 trouncing.

1955
In Durocher's last game as manager, Bobby Hofman underscores the tone of
the season for the Giants as he lines into a 9th-inning season-ending triple
play against the Phillies in a 3-1 loss. Seemingly wanting to end the season
quickly, the Giants hit into double plays in the 7th and 8th. The Giants
win the opener, 5-2, as Willie Mays belts his 51st HR of the year. Mays
ties John Mize for the team record.

The Dodgers close out the regular season with a 4-0 whitewash of the
Phillies. Russ Meyer gets the win. The Dodgers win the season series against
all 7 opponents.

Detroit OF Al Kaline is 0 for 1 but becomes the youngest batting champ in
history, as he takes the AL crown at age 20 with a .340 average. The Tigers
top the Indians, 6-2.

Wally Moon homers, off the Braves' Chet Nichols, to run the league homerun
total to a since-topped NL record 1,263. The Cardinals win, 8-5. The homer
comes on Moon's last at-bat against the Braves this year, matching what he
did against them in 1954.

The Red Sox and Yankees split a WS tune-up, as Stengel uses 17 players in
each game. New York wins, 9-2, then loses, 8-1, to Susce. Williams is 1 for
1 in each game and is replaced with a PR. He finishes the season at .356,
well ahead of Kaline's .340, but he does not have enough at-bats to win
the batting title. The same thing happened in 1954. Williams was walked
136 times in 1954 and 71 times (an AL-leading 17 were intentional) this
year. A rule change will be made to recognize plate appearances, not times
at-bat. The Throneberry brothers face each other for the first time in the
opener with New York's Marv collecting 2 hits to Faye's 0. Haywood Sullivan
and Frank Sullivan, the losing pitcher, are the Boston battery in game 1,
but they aren't related.

1956
At Ebbets Field, Sal Maglie of the Dodgers no-hits the Phils, 5-0, for his
12th win against 4 losses. The win keeps Brooklyn 1/2 game behind the Braves
who beat Cincinnati, 7-1.

In the wake of the Ted Williams spitting incident, the Massachusetts State
Legislature passes a bill to fine fans for profanity during a game. The
bill is later killed.

In a doubleheader at Wrigley Field, the Cards pull off an unusual triple
play. After Solly Drake lines out to Stan Musial, the Cards double off Hobie
Landrith at 2nd. They then throw the ball around the infield, before they
realize that Gene Baker, who had been a runner on 3B, is in the dugout. They
then complete the tri-killing.

At Cleveland, Early Wynn wins his 20th, 4-1, over the A's, with help from

torch light victory parade in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle at midnight
celebrates the pennant.

Ralph Terry clinches the Yankees' 25th pennant with a 4-3 win over the
Red Sox. Luis Arroyo saves the win. It is 70-year-old Casey Stengel's 10th
(and last) pennant in 12 years at New York. Stengel will be let go by the
Yankees and be replaced by Ralph Houk next season.

The Giants outslug the Dodgers, winning 13-9 on 16 hits. Kirkland and
Davenport homer to support Juan Marichal (5-2), who struggles through 6
innings. Willie Davis has a 3-run homer off Marichal, and Tommy Davis has 4
hits, including a homer. Jim Gilliam is 0 for 1 but has 4 walks and scores
4 runs. It will be 10 years before anyone scores 4 runs with no hits.

1962
Whitey Ford beats Washington, 8-3, as the Yankees clinch the AL pennant. Ralph

1964
Dean Chance beats the Twins' Jim Kaat, 1-0, to become the Angels first
20-game winner. Chance's five 1-0 wins in 1964 ties the ML record held by
4 pitchers (Reb Russell, W. Johnson, Bush, Hubbell).

The 1st-place Phils, just 3 1/2 games in the lead after dropping 3 games at
home to the Reds (1-0, 9-2 and 6-4) throw Jim Bunning at the Braves. Bunning
lasts 6 innings but the Braves topple the host Phils, 5-3, as Joe Torre
belts two triples to drives home three runs. In the 2nd contest, the woes
continue as the Phillies lose, 7-5 in 11 innings. Christ Short goes 8 innings
for Philley before exiting with a 3-3 tie. Torre slams a two-run homer in
the 10th, but the Phils match it, before losing it in the 11th. Torre has
three hits in the nitecap with 3 RBIs.

At Shea, Jim Maloney fires a one-hitter in the Reds' 3-0 win over the
Mets. Joe Christopher's 2nd-inning single is the only hit.

1965
At age 34, Willie Mays becomes the oldest player to slug 50 homeruns in a
season. The Giants' center fielder was also the youngest to accomplish the
feat hitting 51 homers in 1955. The first-place Giants top the Braves, 7-5.

Sandy Koufax blanks the Cardinals, 2-0, to win his 24th. He fans 12 along
the way, raising his record season total to 356. His 2-0 shutout of St. Louis
keeps Los Angeles a game behind the Giants.

Another Kansas City publicity stunt makes the great Satchel Paige baseball's
oldest performer. At 59, Paige hurls the first 3 innings, garners one
strikeout, and allows just one hit, to Carl Yastrzemski, in his first ML

loss on reliever Don Mossi with a 5-2 win.

At DC Stadium, the Twins' Mudcat Grant one-hits the Senators to win,
5-0. Don Blasingame's double in the 3rd is the only hit for Washington;
it is the 4th time that Blasingame has collected the only hit for his
team. Grant becomes the first 20-game winner in the AL. Zoilo Versalles
has 4 hits for the Twins, including a triple and a 2-run homer. Minnesota
completes the sweep with a 5-3 win in the nitecap.

In Houston, the Reds' Jim Maloney allows 2 hits in beating Houston, 1-0.

1966

the Cubs, clinched ninth place by beating Cincinnati at Crosley Field, 8-4.

In a matchup of Jewish pitchers, the Cubs' Ken Holtzman outduels Sandy Koufax,
to win 2-1. The Dodgers go hitless over the first 8 innings, before Dick
Schofield notches the first hit with no outs in the 9th. Holtzman, who spent
much of the season in military service, will finish the year at 9-0, the first
pitcher since Howie Krist (10-0) in 1940 to win that many without a loss.

Tony Oliva hits a game-ending homer to break up a scoreless duel between

his last Yankee Stadium at-bat. The aging superstar, after going 1 for 3,
works a walk against Cleveland starter Luis Tiant, who will strike out the
next batter to complete a 3-0 complete-game victory at the Bronx ballpark.
Mantle sliced a two-out first inning single off Tiant, the only hit for
the Yankees. Tiant tosses his 9th shutout of the year, tops in the AL.

losers to the Phils.

1971
With rookie C Tim Hosley hitting 2 homers and driving in 5 runs, the Tigers
trip the Yankees, 10-7. Les Cain pitches 6 innings for the win. Cain finishes
with a 10-9 record and 145 IPs, but contends he is forced to pitch by Manager
Billy Martin while he has a sore arm. Cain later claims that it did permanent
damage to his arm and he sues the Tigers. In a landmark decision, the Michigan
Bureau of Workman's Compensation will order the Tigers to pay Cain $111 a
month for the rest of his life. A lump sum payment was later agreed upon.

1973
It's Willie Mays Night in Flushing as the Mets honor the fan favorite in an

my farewell." Mays had announced his retirement 5 days earlier.

1974
Pittsburgh regains 1st place by edging the Cardinals, 13-12 in 11 innings,

but St. Louis scored 3 times to tie it.

In Los Angeles, Dr. Frank Jobe performs the first elbow ligament transplant,
on 30-year-old pitcher Tommy John. The surgical procedure, which uses
a palmaris longus tendon in either forearm or a tendon from the ankle
or hamstring, will become known as Tommy John surgery. The pitcher quipped
later, "When they operated I told them to put in a Koufax fastball. They did,
but it was Mrs. Koufax'." The procedure will become a commonplace surgical
procedure better known as Tommy John surgery. John will win an additional
164 games, more than half of his career total of 288 victories.

1975
With San Diego's 6-5 victory over Los Angeles, Randy Jones becomes the first

still lose, 12-5. Fisk, Hobson and Yaz all homer for Boston, giving the
Sox a total of 210.

California Angels pitcher Nolan Ryan notches his 341st strikeout of

1979
Behind the solid pitching of Frank Tanana, the Angels defeat the Royals,

same team in the same game.

1980
Brian Kingman loses his 20th game as the A's are defeated by the White
Sox at the Oakland Coliseum, 6-4. The 26-year-old right-hander, who will

of this century and the first to hurl for a winning team since Dolf Luque
went 13-23 for the 1922 second-place Reds.

San Diego's Jerry Mumphrey steals his 50th base of the season in a 5-3 loss
to the Reds, making the Padres the first team in major-league history to
have 3 players with 50 steals in the same season - Mumphrey, Ozzie Smith
and Gene Richards.

1981

With the score tied 4-4 in the bottom of the 9th, Davey Lopes walks, steals
2B and 3B and scores on a pinch single by Bill Spiers as the Cubs beat the
Mets, 5-4. Carter's grand slam accounts for all the Mets' scoring. Lopes has
3 steals in the game to give him 47 (in just 275 at-bats) and he sets the
record for the most stolen bases by a player over 40. The record was set
by Wagner in 1914 with 23. Lopes is officially recorded at 39 but when he
signed at age 22 he was afraid he was too old so he set his age back a year.

1986
Houston's Mike Scott pitches a 2-0 no-hitter against the Giants at the
Astrodome, clinching the NL West title for the Astros. It is the first time
a pennant has ever been decided by a no-hitter, and the 3rd consecutive
game in which Astros pitchers have allowed 2 hits or less.

In George Bamberger's last game as manager of the Brewers, Teddy Higuera
beats Baltimore, 9-3, to become the major leagues' 3rd 20-game winner this

the first player in ML history to achieve both 200 hits and 100 walks in
4 consecutive seasons. It is Boggs' 7th straight 200-hit season overall,
extending his own modern ML record. Dwight Evans also puts his name in the
record books by belting his 20th homer. He is the only current player with
20 or more homers in each of the last 9 years. The Red Sox say that they
will not exercise their option on Jim Rice's contract next season, while Bob
Stanley, the team's all-time save leader with 132, announces his retirement.

At Montreal, the Cubs blow a chance to clinch a tie in the NL East,
losing 4-3 in 10 innings, but back into the tie anyway when St. Louis
lost later on (as noted by Don Mankowski). Andre Dawson homers twice off
Bryn Smith, his second a bizarre inside-the-park blow to give the Cubs a
3-2 lead. Dawson flies deep to CF Dave Martinez, who catches the ball but
suffers a painful muscle-pull doing so and drops to the ground. Dawson keeps
running as Martinez' teammates surround him. The ball is finally thrown in
after Dawson touches home plate. Although at no time did the ball touch
the ground or the fence, the umpires award Dawson a homer over the howls
of protest. Martinez misses the remainder of the series.

1990
The Oakland A's clinch their 3rd consecutive AL West title by beating Kansas
City, 5-0. Dave Stewart (22-10) goes the distance for the win.

the Phils edge the Cubs, 5-4.

1992
The Mariners and Rangers use a major league-record 54 players, 29 by the
Mariners, in Seattle's 4-3 win in 16 innings. The previous mark was 53 set in
1986. Seattle also goes into the record books by using 11 different pitchers;
the previous mark was 10. The first sub was pitcher Rich DeLucia, who did
not enter until the 7th inning, and issues the first walk. The frustrated
Rangers strand 20 runners, helped by a club record of 18 strikeouts. After
Omar Visquel drives home the winning run, Brian Fisher picks up the save,
his first since 1989 and the last of his career.

1993
Cincinnati P Jose Rijo shuts out the Rockies, 6-0, on one hit. Charlie Hayes'
broken bat single in the 2nd inning is Colorado's only hit.

intentional walk, giving him a new NL record of 149 walks in a season.
The free pass is issued in the seventh inning by Mark Guthrie with two outs
and a runner on third base. Bonds also swipes 2 bases giving him 39. The
Dodgers get a homer from Eric Karros, his 34th, and a 2-run pinch homer
from Billy Ashby. Of Ashby's 9 homers, 5 have been pinch hits, one short
of Johnny Fredericks' record. The Giants' win clinches a tie for the NL West.

1997
Eleven years to the day that the club won their last title, the Astros
clinch the NL Central division by beating the Cubs, 9-1. Houston manages
to capture the flag despite being only five games over .500. Mike Hampton
is the winner today.

Donning uniform number 43 to honor recently fired manager Cito Gaston,
Joe Carter becomes the Blue Jays career homerun leader hitting his 203rd
in a 4-3 victory over the Orioles. George Bell, who spent nine seasons in
Toronto, had previously set the franchise mark 1990.

NBC's hit TV show "ER" airs live and includes the Cubs' telecast in
the background of various scenes to authenticate its claim of not being
pre-recorded. The medical drama cuts to the game just as Brad Ausmus hits
a three-run homer much to the delight of the Astros' catcher who is taping
his favorite program to watch later, not knowing he would be part of the cast.

1998
With a 6-1 win over the Devil Rays, the Bronx Bombers set an American League
record with their 112th win. The 1906 Cubs, who went 116-36, are the only

AL record at 111. Orlando Hernandez improves his record to 12-4.

Ken Griffey Jr hits his league-leading 56th homer of the season and 350th of
his career becoming the youngest player ever to reach the milestone. Griffey
drives in 5 runs to lead Seattle to a 15-4 victory over Texas.

The homerun race continues unabated as Sosa blasts his 66th (and final of
the season) homer in the 4th inning at Houston, and McGwire responds in
the 5th inning with his 66th at Busch Stadium. Sosa's solo shot ties the
game at 2-2, but the Astros score in each in the next 4 innings to win,
6-2. Kevin Tapani fails in his bid to win his 20th. The Cards top the Expos,
6-5, as McGwire adds a single and J.D. Drew a pair of homers.

The fading Mets (88-72) lose another to the Braves, 6-5, as Dennis Martinez,
the 3rd of 7 pitchers, is the winner. Meanwhile, the rampaging Giants

with 165 ribbies, matches Ted Williams' and Vern Stephens' output with the
Red Sox in 1949.

Its payback time as the Rangers score 8 runs in the 2nd inning on their
way to beating the Athletics, 10-4.

2000
For only the second time since 1900 three teams have play in a twin bill,
as the Indians beat the White Sox in the opener, 9-2, and lose the nightcap

the Cardinals played host to the Giants (won, 6-4) and Braves (lost, 2-0).

The Braves defeat the Expos, 6-0, as Tom Glavine becomes the NL's 1st
20-game winner. Glavine's 20th career shutout gives him 20 victories in a
season for the 5th time in his career.

2001
The Brewers blast 6 HRs as they defeat the Diamondbacks, 9-4. Jeromy

first teammates ever to accomplish the feat in the same game. Twice they
hit back-to-back homeruns, the 2nd time teammates have done it this year.

Seattle tops Texas, 13-2, setting an AL record for road victories with its
56th of the season.

of the final 3 innings of Pittsburgh's last game, gets hits in each of the
first 3 innings against Chicago, giving him hits in 6 consecutive innings,
against 6 different pitchers, a ML mark. Cubs pitchers fan 10 Pirates,
giving them 1,250 Ks for the year for a new ML mark.

the only players in ML history to steal a base in 4 different decades as
the Expos are shut out by the Mets, 2-0.

the A's 13th home win in a row. Jeremy Giambi has a 3-run pinch double in
the big frame. Angels SS David Eckstein ties the major league rookie record
with his 20th HBP, tying the mark set by Frank Robinson, in 1956.

2002
The Braves beat the Phillies, 7-1, as OF Andruw Jones clouts 3 homeruns
and drives home 4 runs.

Casey Fossum gives up solo homers to Frank Thomas and Joe Crede, but the
Red Sox score 4 in the 6th off Jon Garland to beat Chicago, 4-2. Fossum
helps his cause by snaring a pop bunt in the first inning and trotting to
1B to complete an unassisted DP.

Completing the worst season in the franchise's 34-year history, the Milwaukee
Brewers replace Wendy Selig-Prieb as president and Dean Taylor as general
manager. Ulice Payne takes over as president while Doug Melvin replaces
Taylor. Milwaukee (56-106) is one of 4 teams this year to lose 100 games,
a first in major league history. Kansas City will finish 62-100, Detroit
(55-106) and Tampa Bay (55-106). The last season with three 100-game losers
was 1985 (Cleveland, Pittsburgh and San Francisco).

2003
Sammy Sosa becomes the first National Leaguer to have at least 100 RBIs
nine seasons in a row. The Cubs' right fielder surpasses Mel Ott and Willie
Mays who had accomplished the feat eight straight seasons, and joins Rafael
Palmeiro and Jimmie Foxx as the only players in major league history to
hit 35 homeruns and 100 RBIs for nine consecutive seasons. The Reds beat
the Cubs today, 9-7.

Friends, family, associates and former players gather at Shea Stadium on Bob
Murphy Appreciation Night to honor the long-time broadcaster. Following the

for the team.

The Red Sox upend the Orioles, 14-3, to clinch the wild-card playoff spot.

The Blue Jays outscore the Devil Rays, 10-8, as Carlos Delgado becomes the
15th player in history (and 5th ALer) to hit 4 homers in a game. His 1st
homer of the game is also the 300th of his career. He has 41 this season. He
has shown a progression of power as he's reached homerun milestones:  he
hit one homer in a game for his first career dinger, hit a pair in a game
for his 100th, hit a threesome to reach 200 and hit 4 today.

2008
The Diamondbacks, defending division champions, lose to the Cardinals,
12-3, allowing the Dodgers to clinch the NL West. Los Angeles first-year
skipper Joe Torre's 13-year post-season streak continues, unlike the Yankees,
his former team.

Giving up six hits and two runs in his ninth complete game of the season,
Roy Halladay posts his second 20-win season with an 8-2 victory over the
Yankees at the Rogers Centre. The Blue Jays right-hander, enroute to the
Cy Young Award, compiled a 22-7 record in 2003.

Mark Reynolds strikes out for the 200th time breaking the major league
record set in 2007 by Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. The Diamondbacks'
third baseman will extend the dubious mark to 204 by season's end.

2009
At a position which the team was unable to find a reliable everyday player to
be penciled into the lineup on a consistent basis for decades, David Wright
establishes a franchise record, starting his 836th game at third base for
the Mets, surpassing his hitting coach and friend Howard Johnson. More than
120 players, beginning in 1962 with Don Zimmer, have appeared at the hot
corner for the team, but only ten have appeared in as many as 200 games
during the club's 47-year history.

New York clears the fence for the 127th time at the new Yankee Stadium to
break the franchise record for most homeruns hit by the team at home. Alex
Rodriguez' third-inning poke off John Lester in the Bronx Bombers' 9-5
victory over Boston puts this year's squad ahead of the 2004 and 2005 clubs,
who both went deep 126 times in the old stadium.

2010
In the game in which he sets a team record for striking out, Brandon Inge
drives in the winning run with a walk-off single in the 13th inning of
the Tigers' 11-10 victory over Minnesota. With the second of his three
whiffs of the contest, the Detroit third baseman surpasses the franchise
record of 1,099, playing more than a 1,000 fewer games than Lou Whitaker,
who had held the previous infamous mark.

Bobby Cox, who will retire after the season ends, earns his 2,500th major
league victory as a manager when the Braves blank Washington at Nationals
Park, 5-0. The veteran skipper joins Connie Mack, John McGraw and Tony La
Russa as the fourth field boss to reach this milestone.

Neftali Feliz records his 38th save of the season when he limits the A's
to one hit in an inning and a third of work in the Rangers' 4-3 victory
in Oakland. The freshman closer surpasses Mariner Kazuhiro Sasaki's mark
of 37 in 2000 to establish the record for the most saves by a reliever in
his rookie season.

2012
With Zack Greinke fanning 13 batters during his five-inning outing and the
bullpen adding another seven, the Angels' staff combines for 20 strikeouts
in the team's 5-4 victory over Seattle, tying the record for the most ever
recorded in a nine-inning game. The Anaheim starter's performance makes him
the first hurler since 1920 to whiff 13 opponents in an outing that lasts
less than six innings.

2013
In the final game he plays at Coors Field, Todd Helton homers in his
first at-bat, a second-inning solo in Colorado's 15-5 loss to Boston. The
40-year-old first baseman, who announced his retirement last week, has
spent his entire 17-year career with the Rockies.

2014
Derek Jeter makes his last game at Yankee Stadium very memorable when
he drives in the winning run with in the ninth inning with an opposite
