1901
The AL season ends with the White Stockings in first place by 4 games over
Boston. Jimmy Williams of the Baltimore Orioles leads the AL in triples,
with 21, two years after leading the NL with 27. This feat will be topped
by Sam Crawford in 1902-1903.

1902
In the final game played in Baltimore's Oriole Park, Boston wins, 9-5.

Brooklyn edges the Giants, 5-2, pushing the last place New Yorkers 52 games
behind Pittsburgh. Frank Bowerman scores one New York run when his routine
ground ball is fielded by SS Bill Dahlen and thrown into the stands behind
1B. The rules state the ball is still in play and Bowerman circles the bases.

The AL season ends with the Athletics five games in front of the St. Louis
Browns. Philadelphia's Socks Seybold hits 16 HRs for the highest total to
lead the AL until Babe Ruth's 29 in 1919.

1904
Chicago scores 5 unearned runs in the 2nd inning and rattles Mathewson for
13 hits to beat New York, 7-3. The series-bound Giants will lose 6 in a
row as they stroll towards the end of the season.

1905
In St. Louis, the Giants sweep two from the Cardinals, winning 6-5 and
5-1. Trailing 4-1 to Mathewson in the 9th the Cards knot the opener when Danny
Shay belts a bases loaded triple to send the game into extra innings. New York
scores 2 in the 11th to win, 6-5. Shay will miss next season because of an
amputated finger and his comeback in 1907 with the Giants will be short lived.

1907
In the first game of a doubleheader, Phillies rookie George McQuillan
completes a major league record string of 25 consecutive shutout innings
at the start of a career by fashioning a 1-0 victory over the Cincinnati
Reds. The streak began on May 8 with an inning of relief. McQuillan's first
start, in game two of a doubleheader against the Cardinals, resulted in a
0-0 tie; in his second start, the second game of a doubleheader on September
25, he shut out Chicago. The 22-year-old right-hander's mark will not be
matched for 101 years until broken by A's reliever Brad Ziegler, who will
extend the record to 39 1/3 innings in 2008.

1908
Chicago White Sox ace Ed Walsh is the 3rd pitcher within a week to pitch
and win both ends of a doubleheader, beating Boston. Walsh gives up just
one run and 7 hits, while fanning 15 in winning, 5-1 and 2-0. Walsh did
the same thing to the Red Sox in 1905.

The Pirates sweep a doubleheader against the Cardinals at Exhibition Park, 7-0
and 6-5. In the opener, Howie Camnitz loses a no hitter in the 9th inning on a
single by Champ Osteen. The Bucs win game 2 leaving them a half-game in back
of New York, tied for 2nd with the Cubs. The last-place Redbirds are blanked
for a record 33rd time, averaging more than one whitewash every five games.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants split with the Phils, winning 6-2 and losing
7-0. Mathewson wins the opener, despite giving up 9 hits. Philadelphia then
operates on Doc Crandall for a 2nd-game win.

In Cincinnati, the temporary light towers at the Palace of the Fans contribute
to a homerun by Chicago's Joe Tinker (as noted in Redleg Journal). Tinker
hits a fly ball that lodges in a tower and he circles the bases before CF
Dode Paskert can extricate the ball. Authors Rhodes and Snyder note that
the Cincinnati Enquirer speculates that Paskert would have nabbed the fly
except for the tower structure. Chicago wins, 6-2.

1909
At Chicago, the Cubs take a pair from the Phillies, 5-4 and 6-3. Phils rookie
Fred Luderas debuts and goes 4 for 4 with a HR and a double in the nitecap.

1911
Ty Cobb is fined $100 by the National Commission for playing a Sunday game
with a semipro club in New York.

1913
Walter Johnson wins his 36th game and 11th shutout of the year, defeating
the league champion Athletics, 1-0, on George McBride Day, a day honoring
the Senators' captain and SS. Johnson also sets a ML record with his fifth
1-0 victory, a mark that will be tied in a few days by Reb Russell. Taking
the loss today is rookie Weldon Wyckoff. Johnson will toss a record 110
shutouts during his 21 seasons in the major leagues

At New York, the Yankees finally end the Red Sox road jinx over them by
sweeping the Hubmen, 3-1 and 5-1. It is the first loss in New York for
Boston after a ML-record-tying 18 straight road wins stretching back to 1911,
including 5 wins this year. They had a 3-3 tie on May 24. They'll get back
on track tomorrow by sweeping the Yankees, 3-2 and 3-0.

1914
At Fenway Park, the Cubs drop a 3-2 decision to the Braves as Larry Cheney
walks 11 Boston batters in the game. Tom Hughes, making his first start
for Boston, is the winner on a 5-hitter.

1915
The Phillies clinch their first National League pennant when Grover Cleveland
Alexander tosses a one-hitter blanking the Braves, 5-0. It will take another
35 years before the franchise wins another flag.

On Patsy Moran Day in Boston, the Phils clinch their first pennant for
manager Moran on Pete Alexander's 4th one-hitter and 12th shutout of the
year, 5-0, beating Dick Rudolph and the defending champion Braves. Sherry
Magee's 4th-inning single is the only safety for Boston (the 4th time he's
had the only hit in a game), while Gavvy Cravath clouts a 3-run homer in
the 1st for the Phils. Cravath ends the year leading the NL in homers (24),
slugging, runs, walks, total bases and is the only National Leaguer with
more than a hundred RBIs (115).

Kansas City (FL) lefty Art Packard does it all, winning 1-0 and hitting
a homerun.

Wilbur Good, of the Cubs, hits the last HR at West Side Grounds as Chicago
makes good, winning 5-4, over the Reds.

After whipping the A's, 10-2, the Senators double-up in the second game, 20-5,
pounding pitcher Tom Sheehan for 21 hits in 8 innings. Sheehan will manage
the San Francisco Giants briefly in 1966. Rippy Williams is 5 for 6. In
the first game, Turner Barber is 5 for 5 against OF-P Chick Davies. Bert
Gallia and Doc Ayers are the winners.

1916
Boston Red Sox P Babe Ruth closes the season with his 23rd win, topping
New York, 3-0. It is his 9th shutout and reduces his ERA to 1.75. In 324
IPs he gave up no HRs. The 9 shutouts is a record for lefties that will be
unmatched in the AL until Ron Guidry ties it in 1978.

1917
Babe Ruth coasts to his 6th shutout of the year, an 11-0 pasting of the
Browns. He also leads the offense with 3 hits and 3 runs scored.

1920
The Indians complete a 4-game sweep of the Browns with a 10-2 win. Coveleski
wins his 24th. Cleveland has now won 20 of 26, and are 14-3 with rookie
Joe Sewell in the lineup.

Babe Ruth hits HR number 54 in Philadelphia as the Yankees win, 7-2. That
is more than any other team total except the Phils. He is responsible for
241 of his team's 838 runs, even though he misses 12 games, with a modern
record 158 runs scored, beating Ty Cobb's 147 in 1911.

At Boston, the Braves divide a pair with the Phils, winning 1-0, behind
Joe Oeschger, then losing, 5-1. The first game takes 65 minutes, with game
2 finishing in 1 hour 40 minutes, the fastest doubleheader of the year.

1921
Allen Sothoron establishes a major league record by not yielding a homerun
during the 178 innings he throws this season. The 28-year-old right-hander,
who started the season with the Browns before being sent to the Red Sox
for a brief stint, will pitch the majority of his games with the Indians.

The Bucs drop a doubleheader to the Cardinals allowing the idle Giants to
clinch the NL pennant, their 7th under manager McGraw.

With New York in 1st place by 1 1/2 games over Cleveland, and facing the
Indians in the 4th game of the series, Miller Huggins polls his players
to find out who they'd like to see start. The team elects to go with
veteran Jack Quinn, but the spitballer comes up dry giving up 3 runs in
the 1st inning before Waite Hoyt relieves. Ruth hits a 1st-inning HR, adds
a RBI double in the 3rd and a 2-run HR in the 5th to give the Yankees the
lead. Carl Mays, who took over in the 5th, strikes out Steve O'Neill with
2 on in the 9th to end it, 5-4. The win increases New York's lead to 2 1/2
games. The four-game series at the Polo Grounds draws a record 147,000 people.

1923
The Reds' Dolf Luque ends his campaign in style beating the visiting
Cardinals, 11-1. He leaves after the game for Havana with a ML-leading
won-loss record of 27-8, still the best single-season mark ever posted by
a Latin American pitcher in ML play. Last year his 23 losses led the NL.

The Tigers (77-69) beat the Indians (76-68), 3-0, and move into a tie for
2nd place in the AL ... each with a .527 winning percentage. Rookie Earl
Whitehill (2-0) wins in relief of starter Dauss, who is given the hook
(as noted by Retrosheet). Umpire Holmes stops the game and rules that Ty
Cobb is using an illegal bat. Cobb chooses 3 others, then asks if he may
go back to his locker and find another.

1924
With the blue law preventing any games yesterday in Boston or Philadelphia,
the Senators clinch the pennant by beating the Red Sox, 4-2, finishing
2 games in front of the Yankees, rained out in Philley. The win goes to
Firpo Marberry.

The Pirates trip the Cubs, 5-4, with the help of Jigger Statz, who plays
second base for the only time this season. Jigger has two errors and throws
high on a DP attempt to help the Bucs score. He does have a stolen base,
the only one of the game. This gives the Cubs 137 stolen bases versus being
thrown out 148 times ... a 48% success rate for the year.

In the next-to-last game of the Western League season, Lyman Lamb of Tulsa
hits his 100th double of the year. It is 25 doubles higher than any other
season total in organized baseball.

1926
In the only games played today, the 7th place Braves sweep a pair from the
last-place Phillies, 7-6 and 2-1. Rookies Johnny Werts and Bunny Hearn are
the winning hurlers over Claude Willoughby and Dutch Ulrich.

1927
Babe Ruth hits 2 HRs to tie his 59 of 1921 in a 15-4 win over Washington. The
2nd of the HRs is a 5th-inning grand slam off Paul Hopkins, making his
ML debut, and is the Babe's 2nd slam in 2 games. He will match the feat
on August 6 and 7, 1929. Hopkins started the fifth inning and loaded the
bases for the Babe.

1928
Behind Bill Sherdel and Flint Rhem, the Cardinals win the NL pennant with
a 3-1 victory at Boston while the Cubs are beating New York, 6-2. The final
margin is 2 games over the Giants, 4 over the Cubs.

At Navin Field, the Tigers and Yankees tie an AL offensive record when they
combine for 45 hits, Detroit tallying 28 of them. Four Tigers collect 4 hits
apiece for a since-tied AL record, as Detroit wins the slugfest, 19-10. The
Yanks will finish the season with the top three RBI men (Gehrig and Ruth
with 142, Bob Meusel with 113), just the 2nd time this has happened. It
will occur just once more, with the 1932 Phils.

1929
At Wrigley, Charlie Root and the Cubs edge the Reds, 1-0. Roger Hornsby's 39th
homer, off Benny Frey, is the only score. He also adds 2 singles and a double.

Setting a record not matched till 2002, for the third game in a row the
White Sox enter the 9th inning with a lead, only to lose the game. Detroit's
Jonathon Stone hits a homer in the 9th to tie the game and singles in the
11th to win, 9-8. Detroit scored 2 in the 9th yesterday, then 3 more in
the 10th to beat the Sox, 11-10. On the 25th, Glenn Myatt of Cleveland hit
a 3-run homer in the 9th to give the Indians a 9-7 win over Chicago.

The Red Sox jump on A's ace Lefty Grove, collecting 11 hits in 5 innings
off him, and rolling to a 10-0 win. The AL leaders collect a scratch single
off Red Ruffing and just 3 infield singles off reliever Milt Gaston.

1932
Lefty Gomez breezes to a 5-2 win over the Cubs, and Gehrig gets 3 hits for
the Yankees' 2nd victory.

1933
With the Giants in the stands at Yankee Stadium, the Senators pile up
a 5-0 lead over the Yankees, and then bring in the reserves to score an
8-5 win. Heinie Manush's double and homer and three RBIs lead the Nats'
attack. Ruth has a triple. Gehrig keeps his consecutive game streak alive,
playing nine innings after getting married at noon today in New Rochelle.

Before a crowd of just 200 at Ebbets Field, the Braves down the Dodgers,
4-1. The game is a playoff of Thursday's 2-2 tie in ten innings, and the
Braves score four unearned runs to hand Walter Beck his 20th loss of the year.

1934
At Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC, Babe Ruth hits his 659th and final
homerun wearing pinstripes as a Yankee. The 'Bambino' had 49 homers with the
Red Sox prior to coming to New York and will hit six additional round-trippers
with the Braves before retiring next season. New York splits the doubleheader
with Washington, losing 8-5 and winning 9-6. Ruth's homer comes off rookie
Sid Cohen, who wins his 1st ML game.

Brooklyn's Van Mungo knocks the Giants out of the lead at the Polo Grounds,
5-1, though he gives up 11 hits. Mungo adds 2 hits and fans 3 Giants in
the 9th. Meanwhile Paul Dean is beating the Reds in St. Louis, 6-1.

The Tigers tune up for the series with a pair of wins over the Browns,
10-6 and 6-2. Detroit totals 101 wins for the year. In game 2, the Browns
use 46-year-old coach Grover Hartley behind the plate, and send up coach
Charlie O'Leary to pinch hit. In his first appearance since 1913, O'Leary
singles and scores a run ... at age 52, he's the oldest ML player ever to do
so. The Tigers counter with coach Cy Perkins, 38, but he makes an out. 3B
Marv Owen plays both games and picks up one RBI to finish with 96. Joined
with Tigers 1B Greenberg (139), 2B Gehringer (127) and SS Rogell (100),
the Tigers infield comes closest in ML history to all reaching 100 RBIs. The
1941 Red Sox will be the only other team to have all infielders over 90 RBIs.

1935
The Cubs lose, 2-1, to the Cardinals. Left fielder Augie Galan plays in
his 154th game of the season, ending the year without hitting into a DP,
still a ML record (Reiser does it in 1942, but plays fewer games). Augie
did hit into a triple play to open the season. The Cubs lone score comes
on Billy Herman's 57th double.

Against Washington, Jimmie Foxx slams his 35th homer in the 4th inning
to give the A's a 4-2 lead. When the Nats tie, Double X hits his 36th in
the 7th to put the A's in the lead and tie Hank Greenberg for the AL HR
title. Washington retakes it, but the A's score 4 to win, 11-8. Washington's
Buddy Myer goes 4 for 5 to edge out Cleveland's Joe Vosmik for the AL batting
title, .349 to .348. In Cleveland's doubleheader, Vosmik pinch hits in game
one making an out, and plans on taking the rest of the afternoon off. When
he hears that Myer is hot, he plays, going 1 for 3 to "lose" the title. Foxx
finishes at .346.

After winning the first game, 3-2, against Detroit, the White Sox tie the AL
record with 10 singles in the 2nd inning of game 2 off Eldon Auker. They tally
8 runs in the frame and win, 14-2, as Auker loses his 7th against 18 wins,
the best percentage in the AL. Firpo Marberry umps his last game. Released
by the Tigers in June, Firpo was an AL ump for the 2nd half of the year,
but will sign with the Giants after the season.

Two outstanding strikeout performances are recorded today. Brooklyn's Van
Lingle Mungo strikes out 15 Phillies and allows 2 hits in beating Jorgens,
2-0. The 2nd game ends in a 4-4 tie. The Braves' Danny MacFayden matches
Mungo, striking out 15 Giants in a 3-0 win in a twinbill split at Boston. The
15 is the most K's in regulation in the NL since 1909 (Vance matched it 3
times). Not until Koufax, in 1959, will a NL hurler strike out more in a
9-inning game.

In a 9-6 nitecap loss against the Reds, Pittsburgh C Aubrey Epps goes 3 for 4
with a triple and 3 RBIs. This will be the only ML game for the Memphis prep
star, who will be sold to the Memphis club on May 15, 1937. Appearing also
in his first ML game is Claude Passeau, who gives up 4 runs in 3 innings for
the Bucs ... they will trade him in 2 months. The Pirates take the opener,
4-1, behind Mace Brown's 4-hitter.

At New York's Dykeman Oval, a doubleheader between a team of all-stars
featuring Babe Ruth and the Cuban Giants attracts a crowd of 10,000. Ruth is
1 for 4 with a walk as the Giants, behind Luis Tiant Sr, win 6-1. With Ruth
on the bench, the nightcap ends after 6 innings with the Giants leading, 14-6.

1937
New York rookie Cliff Melton wins his 20th game, 6-3, in the opening game of
a doubleheader, but the Phillies beat the Giants in the 2nd game, 6-5 in 7
1/2 innings, preventing New York from clinching the flag. Pitcher-infielder
Bucky Walters plays 3B in both games and belts a 1st-inning grand slam in
the nitecap off Harry Gumbert.

1938
Bill Lee, pitching for the 4th straight day, gives the Cubs a 10-1 win over
the faltering Pirates. The Cubs now lead by 1 1/2 games and have won ten
games in a row.

In the Tigers' 6-2 win over the Browns, Hank Greenberg is held to a single.

1940
Johnny Rucker, a Life magazine cover boy at the start of the season, based
on his .346 average with Atlanta and his speed afoot, never quite lives up
to the ballyhoo. But this day he hits a grand slam and drives in seven runs
in two consecutive innings, as the Giants whip Boston, 14-0.

The Reds win their 100th game, beating the visiting Pirates, 11-3, behind
Bucky Walters. With one error in the game, Bill McKechnie's Cincinnati
team totals just 117 errors during the season, a ML record and 18 less than
any previous team. The .981 fielding mark is the best up to this time. The
defense, plus the pitching of Bucky Walters, Paul Derringer and reliever
Joe Beggs, brings the 2nd straight NL flag to the Reds, despite multiple
injuries to Ernie Lombardi. The big catcher went down again September 15th,
and with Hershberger's suicide, the club turns to 39-year-old coach Jimmy
Wilson for some of the backstopping. Wilson will end up as a WS hero.

The AL finishes the season drawing 5,433,791, surpassing the attendance
record set in 1924.

1941
A crowd estimated at one million jams downtown Brooklyn to cheer the Dodgers
in a parade.

1943
St. Louis SS Vern Stephens sets a ML record by hitting 2 homers in extra
innings - the 11th and 13th in a 4-3 win over Boston. Game 2 is stopped at
3-3. His feat will not be topped, and the next player to match him will be
Willie Kirkland, in 1963.

The Cards recall Preacher Roe from Columbus and sell him to the Pirates.

1944
The final series of the year begins. Trailing Detroit by one game, the
Browns have 4 games with the Yankees, who are three games out of first
place. With rainouts the night before, all contenders play doubleheaders.

The Browns are last in the AL in attendance, and only 6,172 fans watch
St. Louis sweep the critical Friday night doubleheader. With the help of
Jack McQuillan's two-run homer, Jack Kramer takes the opener, 4-1. In the
nitecap, Nels Potter wins a 1-0 shutout over the Yankees' Hank Borowy,
even though St. Louis batters get but 2 hits.

In Detroit, the Tigers split with 2 of the Washington knuckleballers,
beating Johnny Niggeling in the opener, 5-2, behind Rufe Gentry, but losing
to Mickey Haefner, 9-2, in the nightcap. Stan Spence's three-run homer in
the 3rd off Dizzy Trout is the Nats' big blow.

1945
At Forbes Field, the Cubs clinch the NL flag on Hank Borowy's 4-3 win
over Pittsburgh in the first game of a doubleheader. The final margin for
Chicago is 3 games over the Cardinals. During the season the Cubs win 20
doubleheaders, a ML record. Chicago takes the nitecap, 5-0, scoring all 5
runs in the 4th inning. The big blow is catcher Paul Gillespie's 2-run homer
off Rip Sewell, the hit coming in his final major league at-bat (Gillespie
will go 0 for 6 in the WS). The game is called after 7 innings. Gillespie
is the first of only two players in baseball history ever to hit homeruns
in their first and last big league at-bats. The wartime Cubs reserve catcher
went deep against the Giants at the Polo Grounds on September 11, 1942.

1946
The Cardinals and the Dodgers end the season tied for the NL lead. Both are
96-58. The first-ever championship playoff series will start in 2 days. Former
Cardinal P Mort Cooper pitches Boston to a 4-0 win over Brooklyn. The Cards
can't capitalize on the Dodger loss, however, as Cubs lefty Johnny Schmitz
beats them, 8-3.

Giants SS Buddy Kerr plays in his 52nd game without an error, breaking Leo
Durocher's NL record set in 1931. The Giants whip the Phils, 3-1.

Feller and Newhouser hook up again, with Newhouser going for his 27th win,
but this time Feller and the Indians beat Detroit, 4-1. Not till Newhouser
strikes out does Feller register a K. Feller will strike out 5 Tigers to end
the season with 348, believed to be the new record. Subsequent research will
credit Waddell with 349 K's in 1904. Feller ends the year with a no-hitter,
two one-hitters and 10 shutouts in 371 innings.

Johnny Vander Meer pitches a game-1 shutout, beating the Pirates, 1-0. Bob
Usher drives in the lone run. In the nitecap, outfielder Al Libke starts on
the mound and pitches 5 innings, allowing 2 runs and 4 hits in his last ML
appearance. The former minor league pitcher gets no decision but the Reds
win, 3-2, to close out their season.

1947
Joe McCarthy, who led the Yankees to 9 pennants, is coaxed out of retirement
and signs to manage the Red Sox. Joe Cronin will become general manager of
Tom Yawkey's team.

1948
On two days rest, Bob Feller gives up ten hits and strikes out just three,
but the Indians stop the White Sox, 5-2. Joe Gordon hits his 32nd homer
and Ken Keltner hits his 31st to keep the Indians two games ahead.

The race stays tight as rookie righty Bob Porterfield gives New York a 4-2
win over the A's. Fellow Rookie Hank Bauer belts his first major league
homer, a three-run shot off Dick Fowler.

Johnny Sain picks up his 23rd victory in the Braves' 4-3 win over the
Dodgers, but Boston loses star Jeff Heath, who snaps a bone 2 inches above
the ankle sliding home. He is hitting .319 with 20 homers and will miss the
Series. By special permission of commissioner Happy Chandler, the Braves
add Marv Rickert as Heath's replacement on the WS roster. Rickert spent
the 1948 season at Milwaukee hitting .302 with 27 HRs.

Ellis Kinder gives the Red Sox a 5-1 win over the Senators. The Fenway fans
also react to the news from Brooklyn that Braves star Jeff Heath had broken
his ankle at home plate. The Red Sox players are less sympathetic since
Heath, in a radio interview, said he hoped the Indians, not the Red Sox,
won the AL pennant because their larger stadium would mean a bigger pay check.

Detroit's Hal Newhouser stops the Browns, 4-0, for his 20th win of the year.

1949
The Cardinals lose to former Redbird Murry Dickson, now with the Pirates,
7-2. It is Dickson's 5th win against St. Louis this year.

The visiting Dodgers take 2 from the Braves, 9-2 and 8-0, and stay in
front with a half-game lead. In the 5th and last inning of game two, Braves
infielder Connie Ryan protests against playing in the rain by kneeling on
the on-deck circle with his raincoat on. Umpire George Barr ejects Ryan from
the game. Meanwhile, his teammates kindle a fire in the dugout as a guiding
beacon for returning batsmen. Preacher Roe wins the opener and Newcombe
coasts in game 2. Spahn is tagged with the loss in game 1 when the Brooks
pound out 5 runs in the 4th, featuring a 3-run homer by Snider. Furillo
hits a 3-run homer in the 6th. In the nitecap, the Dodgers route Sain with
5 runs in the 1st inning.

Both the Red Sox and Yankees have the day off.

1950
The idle Yankees clinch their 2nd consecutive pennant under Casey Stengel,
as Cleveland's Bob Lemon sets down Detroit, 12-2, for his 23rd win.

The Cardinals name Marty "Mr. Shortstop" Marion as their player-manager
for 1951.

The Dodgers win a pair from Boston, 7-5 and 7-6, shaving the idle Phils
lead to 2, with 2 head-to-head games at Ebbets Field remaining.

1951
The Giants and Dodgers both win on shutouts to stay tied. New York tops
Warren Spahn and the Braves, 3-0, on Maglie's 23rd win and Don Newcombe
shuts out the Phillies, 5-0, for his 20th victory. Campy and Pafko homer
as Robin Roberts takes the Phils' loss. Newcombe becomes the first black
to win twenty games in a season.

1953
The AL adopts a constitutional amendment calling for expansion to 10 teams.

A Baltimore syndicate headed by Baltimore Mayor Tom D'Alesandro buys Bill
Veeck's interest in the Browns for $2.475 million. The AL then approves
the shift of the Browns to Baltimore without Bill Veeck.

The Reds name Birdie Tebbetts as their new manager, replacing the fired
Hornsby.

1954
In game 1 of the WS, Willie Mays of the Giants makes one of the greatest
catches in history when he races back to deep CF in the Polo Grounds to make
an over-the-head catch of Indian Vic Wertz' 462-foot drive in the 8th with
the score tied at 2-2. Wertz drove in the 2 runs in the first with a triple,
the first of his 4 hits. But in the 10th, Dusty Rhodes hits a pinch-hit 3-run
260-foot HR off Bob Lemon to give the Giants a 5-2 victory. With Mays in the
Giants lineup, and Avila in Cleveland's, it marks just the 3rd time that
the league batting champs have faced each other in the WS. Mays will give
the glove he used to make "The Catch" to teammate Don Liddle's 6-year son,
Craig, who will use the immortal piece of leather in Little League games
when he gets older.

1955
In game 2, lefty Tommy Byrne defeats Dodger Billy Loes, 4-2, to go 2 games
up. The pitcher's 2-run single caps a 4-run 4th for the Yanks. Byrne becomes
the only lefty to hurl a complete game against Brooklyn in 1955.

1956
The Cincinnati Redlegs tie the 1947 Giants record of 221 homers in a season
in beating the Cubs, 9-6.

The Dodgers sweep a pair from the Pirates, 6-2 and 3-1, as Milwaukee loses
to St. Louis in 12 innings. The Dodgers now lead by one game with just one
game to go.

The Yanks and the Red Sox use a record 44 players in the game ... the 26 used
by New York sets a new ML mark. Williams has 6 at-bats in the extra-inning
battle, but manages just a single, to take him out of the running for the
hitting crown. Suffering from a pulled groin muscle, Mantle pinch hits
and walks with the bases loaded. Mantle does not start tomorrow. But when
Stengel hears that Kaline knocks in 2 runs in Detroit, he sends Mick in

Phils' Dave Philley sets a ML record by getting his 8th consecutive pinch hit.

On the final day of the season, John Paciorek, brother of Tom and Jim, goes 3
for 3 driving in three runs and scoring four times in his big league debut as
Houston routs the Mets at Colt Stadium, 13-4. Due to severe back problems,
the 18-year-old Colt .45's right fielder, who also makes two outstanding
defensive catches, will never again play in a big league game. Brother Tom
will play 1970-87 with 1162 hits and brother Jim will collect 23 hits.

On Stan Musial Day in St. Louis, The Man has 2 hits, giving him an NL career
total of 3,630. His 1st hit is a 4th-inning single past 2B Pete Rose. After
his 2nd hit off Jim Maloney, driving in his 1,951st run, Musial retires
for a pinch runner as 27,576 roar their approval. Rose has 3 hits in the
game but the Cards beat the Reds in 14 innings, 3-2. Musial will retire
with 3,630 hits (1815 hits at home and 1815 on the road).

Dave Nicholson suffers his 174th and 175th strikeouts, a ML record, as
Washington beats Chicago, 9-2.

1964
Masanori Murakami becomes the first player born in Japan to win a major
league game. At Candlestick Park, the 20-year-old southpaw one-hits the
Colt .45's over three innings, and the Otsuki native gets the victory when

a dramatic walk-off 5-4 win in the bottom of the 11th inning.

Reds getting 11 hits off Bob Friend) to end the Reds' nine-game winning
streak. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals defeat the Phillies, 4-2,
at Busch Stadium, the seventh win in the Cardinals' eight-game winning
streak and the ninth loss in the Phillies' 10-game losing streak. The win,
Ray Sadecki's 20th of the season, puts the Cardinals into a tie for first
place with the Reds. St. Louis had been 11 games out of first on August 23.

In a pre-game ceremony with Harry Caray as the master of ceremonies, the
Cardinals honor retiring outfielder Roger Maris. The former two-time MVP

Bronx, thanks the friendly Busch Stadium crowd and the team, remarking that
his two seasons in St. Louis was his "most enjoyable years in baseball".

Rodriguez blasts 42 bombs with the Mariners.

1970
Winning pitcher Ted Abernathy singles home a run in the 12th to give
the Royals a 14-13 win over the Twins. The 2 teams use 49 players, 27 by

against just 2 losses.

1978
Bob Stanley makes just his 3rd start of the year, shutting out the Blue
Jays at Fenway, 11-0. Stanley has a one-hitter but Dick Drago takes over
in the 7th as the two hurlers allow just 3 hits. Jim Rice's first-inning
double and 2nd-inning single gives him 400 total bases for the year. He is
the first player to reach that mark in the AL since Joe DiMaggio in 1937
... Aaron had 400 in 1959. Lynn and Hobson both collect 3 hits.

The first-place Yankees, trailing Cleveland 1-0, score 3 runs in the 8th
to win, 3-1.

Pittsburgh's Kent Tekulve sinks the Phillies twice, winning both games in
relief, 5-4 and 2-1. He pitches 2 innings in the opener and pitches 1 1/3
in the nitecap, winning in the 10th. Bruce Kison pitches 6 innings in the
nitecap, allowing only Greg Luzinksi's homerun. Kison adds a homer of his

is the 2nd major leaguer to cycle with only 4 hits.

1979
The Astros' J. R. Richard shuts out the Dodgers, 3-0, and fans 11 batters
to break his own modern NL record for strikeouts by a righthander. Richard
finishes with 313 K's, 10 more than in 1978. One of 5 Dodger hits is a single
by Manny Mota, his 146th pinch hit, breaking the mark of 145 formerly held
by Smoky Burgess who had his last pinch hit in 1967.

1980

In his 9th ML start, Oakland's Mike Warren pitches a no-hitter against the
AL West champion White Sox, 3-0, in front of 9,058 fans. The game lasts
only 2 hours 20 minutes. It is the first no-hitter by a rookie since Jim
Bibby's on July 30, 1973. Warren will win only 9 games in his career,
and this will be his only shutout. Warren is the 15th rookie in baseball
history to throw a no-hitter.

In the Reds last home game, Johnny Bench hits a 2-run pinch single in his
last ML at-bat. The Reds still lose to the Giants, 11-7.

the first ML pitch he sees, but the Indians fall to the Twins, 6-5. Bell
tolls his homerun off Bert Blyleven, for whom Bell, along with 2 other
players, had been traded the previous year. Bell's dinger is the 47th of
the season against Bert Blyleven, breaking the ML record of 46 homeruns
allowed by Robin Roberts in 1956. Blyleven will end the year with 50 gophers.

1987
Don Mattingly hits his ML-record 6th grand slam of the season off Boston's
Bruce Hurst in a 6-0 Yankees victory, eclipsing the mark shared by Ernie
Banks (1955) and Jim Gentile (1961). Mattingly's record grand slam is the
last of his career. Remarkably, it will be the only six bases-full homers
he'll hit during his entire 14-year career.

1988
Better late than never. The Cubs trade veteran C Jody Davis to the Braves
for pitchers Kevin Coffman and Kevin Blankenship. Davis, an Atlanta native,
would have been released at the end of the season and the Cubs make the
trade as a favor.

be named later. That turns out to be P Doug Cline, acquired in 2 weeks.

1990

never out of first place, are the first NL team ever to lead from wire to
wire in a 162-game schedule.

1991
Rickey Henderson hits safely in each of the first 5 innings as Oakland
scores 18 runs. Rickey has singles in the first, second, third and fourth

seventh, leaving with 4 runs and 4 RBIs. Oakland wins over Texas, 19-5,
inflicting much of the damage (8 runs) on starter Kevin Brown.

exchange for P Turk Wendell and P Yorkis Perez.

The New York Mets fire manager Bud Harrelson, the eighth managerial firing
of the year.

1992

to MacFarlane.

The Atlanta Braves wrap up the National League West with a 6-0 shutout of
the San Francisco Giants.

1993

future Hall of Famer. At the conclusion of the ceremony, with fireworks
lighting up the sky, the KC third baseman circles the stadium in a golf
cart and then kneels down and kisses home plate.

Toronto defeats Milwaukee, 9-6, as Blue Jays 1B John Olerud ties the AL
record for intentional walks in a season with 33. Ted Williams set the

pitches in a season. His 2 errant tosses give him a total of 25 for the year,
erasing Jack Morris' record, set in 1987.

The Rockies put a crimp in the Giants by beating them, 5-3. Darryl Boston
has a pair of homers and Nelson Liriano has one to lead the Rockies. The
Giants are now tied with the Braves, winners today over Houston.

1995
The Cubs come back again, scoring three times in the 9th to tie the Astros,
then scoring in the 10th to win, 4-3. The win, the 8th straight for the

straight extra-inning loss. The Astros trail the Rockies by a game for the
wild card slot.

The Mariners clinch a tie for the AL West with a 4-3 victory over Texas.

Kevin Brown tops the Tigers, 6-0, for the Orioles 3rd straight complete-game
shutout.

Relation Committee had illegally attempted to eliminate free agency and
salary arbitration.

1996

6-3 win over the Cardinals, giving him a major league season-high 29-game
hitting streak.

The Blue Jays beat Baltimore on the final day of the season, 4-1, behind
Pat Hentgen. Hentgen wins his 20th, joining Jack Morris as the 2nd Blue Jay
pitcher in history to win 20. The O's only run is Brady Anderson's lead-off
HR, his 50th HR of the year. The Orioles end the year with a ML record 257
HRs. Both the Mariners (245) and the A's (243) surpass the old record of 240,
set by the 1961 Yankees. Anderson is the 14th player to hit 50 homeruns in
a season. The power surge comes as a surprise given the Baltimore leadoff
hitter's previous season high was only 21 round-tripper.

Chris Gwynn, brother of Tony, hits a 2-run pinch-hit double in the 11th
inning to give the Padres a 2-0 win over the Dodgers. The double is off
Chan Ho Park and the win cinches the NL West pennant for the Pods. The
Dodgers lose all 4 games in the series.

The Rockies beat the Giants, 12-3, as Andres Galarraga has 3 hits, 3
runs and 3 RBIs. He finishes the season with 150 ribbies, the first to
reach that mark since Tommy Davis in 1962, and his 47 homers leads the
NL. Dante Bichette collects his 141st RBI giving the Rockies two players
with 140+ ribbies, the first time 2 teammates have topped the mark since
the Red Sox of 1950. Vinnie Castilla hits his 40th homer, joining Ellis
Burks and Galarraga as the 2nd team to have 3 teammates reach that mark.
(The first team was the Braves in 1973 - Davey Johnson, 43; Darrell Evans,
41; and Hank Aaron, 40.) The Rocks are the first team to score 900 runs
since the 1953 Dodgers, but they give up more than 900 as well.

Albert Belle has no RBIs in the Indians' 4-1 loss to the Royals and finishes
with an AL-high 148.

is the star, hitting a HR, driving in 3 and scoring the winning run. Craig
Biggio, playing in his NL-best 381st straight game, is lifted for a pinch

6-2. Damon Buford has 2 RBIs and Nomar Garciaparra hits a 2-run homer,
while Nomar ends the game with an unassisted DP. Chicago takes the nitecap,
4-2, as most of the Boston regulars sit.

The Phils down the Cubs, 5-0, holding Sammy Sosa homerless while Doug
Glanville hits a three-run homer. Glanville reaches 200 hits, the first
Phillie to do so in 20 years (Pete Rose, 1979). Carlton Loewer, out with a
stress fracture the last 4 months, makes his first start since June 5 and
pitches 4 scoreless innings.

The Cards sweep the Padres, winning 4-3 and 6-5, as Mark Mcgwire hits a
pair of homers (#62 and #63) to take over the lead from Sammy Sosa.

single-season homerun record with his career best 43rd round tripper helping

York clinches its 3rd straight AL East title, however, when the Red Sox
lose to the Devil Rays, 8-6.

For the 2nd day in a row, the Reds win, 8-1, on a 2-hitter. This time it's
the Cardinals, as Ron Villone strikes out 16 batters - Tatis 4 times - to tie
the club record set by Noodles Hahn (1901) and Jim Maloney (1963). Villone's
previous high was 8. He allows just 2 hits in what will be his last game as
a Red ... Cincy will trade him to the Rockies on November 8 for 2 players
to be named later. Sean Casey homers for the 2nd day in a row.

The Anaheim Angels beat Seattle, 9-3, slugging 3 homers off Abbott. Darren
Erstad has a triple and drives in his 100th run, a ML record by a leadoff
batter. Ortiz is the winning pitcher.

knife and the injury will force him to miss post season play.

2001
On three consecutive pitches, Astros starter Dave Mlicki gives up homers
to Fred McGriff, Rondell White and Todd Hundley in the 1st inning. The
back-to-back-to-back homers enable the Cubs to beat Houston, 6-2.

Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki gets his 234th hit of the season breaking
'Shoeless' Joe Jackson's 1911 rookie record for hits in a season. The
historic hit also ties the 1985 major league mark for singles in a season
established by Wade Boggs with 187 playing with the Red Sox.

As he did last Sunday, Brian Jordan provides late inning slugging to give
the Braves an 8-5 win over the Mets. Jordan's 9th-inning 2-out 2-strike
grand slam, off Benitez, caps a 6-run rally for the Braves. The Mets waste
a gutty 8-inning performance from Al Leiter and are now 5 games behind the
Braves with 7 to play.

At Denver, Denny Neagle hits a 4th-inning grand slam to put the Rockies
ahead, 13-6, but he's not around for the decision, a 12-10 win over the
Brewers. Milwaukee cuffs Neagle for 9 runs. Neagle's slam is the big blow
in a 7-run 4th that also features a double steal, with Greg Norton swiping
home. The Brewers launch 4 homers, including Richie Sexson's 40th. Shumpert
is 4 for 4 for the Rocks.

The A's defeat the Mariners, 8-4, as SS Miguel Tejada hits for the cycle
(the 15th player in A's history), capping his night with a 7th-inning grand
slam. As noted by Chris Strohmier, he's the first player to do that since
Tony Lazzeri, in 1932. Tejada had tripled in the first inning, singled in
the third and doubled in the sixth. Seattle OF Ichiro Suzuki gets his 234th
hit of the season to set a new ML rookie record. The previous mark had been
set by Shoeless Joe Jackson in 1911. Suzuki also ties the AL record for
singles in a season (187) with the hit. Wade Boggs performed the feat in 1985.

2002
On the last day of the season, the Braves use 24 players with the Mets
using 21 to tie the major league record for the most players employed in
a nine-inning game. The Expos and the Cubs also combined to use 45 players
on September 5, 1978.

Barry Bonds sets a new season mark for on-base percentage with a .582 OBP. The
38-year-old Giant left fielder, who became the oldest first-time winner of
a batting title hitting .370, easily surpassed the 1941 mark established
by Ted Williams with a .553 OBP.

Jason Giambi homers in his first two trips to the plate in the Yankees'
6-0 win over Tampa Bay at the Stadium. The pair of round-trippers gives
the slugging outfielder a total of 40 for the season, and when added with
Jeremy's total of 20 homeruns hit with Oakland and Philadelphia, the Giambi
brothers set the record for homers by siblings in the same season, topping
the 59 hit by Joe (46) and Vince DiMaggio (13) in 1937.

The D'Backs clinch the home field advantage with an 11-8 thumping of the
Rockies. John Patterson is the winner over fellow rookie Stark (11-4). In the
2nd, Patterson is thrown out at 1B by RF Gabe Kaplar 9-3, on an apparent hit,
and serves up a HR to Juan Pierre, his first homer in 590 at-bats. Pierre
avoids matching Harold Reynolds, who went homerless in 1989. Curt Schilling,
in his first relief appearance since 1992, tees up a 3-run HR to Brant
Butler in the 8th. Chad Moeller leads the Snakes with a 4 for 4 effort,
including 2 homers and 6 RBIs.

The Cardinals win their 97th, beating the Brewers, 4-0. Andy Benes pitches 5
innings before leaving with a back twinge. Wayne Franklin pitches 7 innings
for the Brewers. Edgar Renteria knocks in the game's 1st run in the 8th with
the 1st of 2 RBIs. He finishes with 82 RBIs, the highest for a Bird SS since
Doc Lavan's 82 in 1921. Albert Pujols has no RBIs, but finishes with 127,
one behind NL leader Lance Berkman. Pujols is the first batter since Ted
Williams in 1939-40 to drive in more than 250 runs in his first two seasons
in the majors. Pujols drove in 257 runs in his first two campaigns. Just 4
big-leaguers have posted 250 or more RBIs in their first two years in the
majors. Joe DiMaggio holds the record with 292 ribbies in his first two;
Dale Alexander with 272 is in 2nd place.

The Florida Marlins report their second-largest crowd of the year - 28,599 -
thanks to the purchase of 18,000 tickets by an unnamed fan. Thus the Marlins
end the season with an attendance mark of 813,118 just ahead of the Expos'
reported 812,545. The Marlins reward the fans with a 4-3 10th-inning win
over the Phillies. Luis Castillo, with 3 stolen bases in the game, scores
from 3B on a foul fly. He finishes the year with 48 steals, high in the
NL. The Marlins finish below .500 again, and have only finished above .500
in 1997, when they won the WS. The Phils (80-81) finish below .500 for the
14th time in 16 years.

The Cubs fire manager Bruce Kimm, who took over from Don Baylor on July
5. Kimm requested that the announcement be made prior to the game, a 7-3 Cubs
win. Kerry Wood (12-12) strikes out 9 in 6 innings, and the Cub relievers add
6 more. The Cubs end the season leading the majors in strikeouts by batters
(1,269) and pitchers (1,333), the first team to accomplish the feat since
Boston (UA) in 1884. Sammy Sosa hits his 49th to lead the NL; it is 499th
career homer (45 have come in starts by Wood). Pluses for the Bucs include 2
homers, one by Tony Alvarez, his first in the majors. Josh Fogg (12-12) sets
a modern club record for starts by a rookie (33); Sam Leever had 39 in 1899.

2003
The Orioles fire manager Mike Hargrove after four consecutive losing seasons
under his command.

The White Sox fire manager Jerry Manuel after six years at the helm.

2004
With the Braves beating the Mets, 6-3, Bobby Cox becomes the ninth manager
in baseball history to win 2,000 games as a manager. He is the 9th man to
reach 2,000. All of the other skippers who have reached this milestone are
enshrined in the Hall of Fame with the exception of Tony LaRussa, who is
still active managing the Cardinals.

Major League Baseball announces Washington D.C. will become the new home
of the Montreal Expos in time for the 2005 season. The nation's capital,
which was chosen over finalists including Las Vegas and Northern Virginia,
will have baseball for the first time in 33 years since the expansion
Senators left in 1971 to become the Texas Rangers.

Cubs reliever LaTroy Hawkins blows his 2nd save in five days and the Cubs
eventually lose to the Reds, 4-2. Chicago slips a half-game behind Houston
in the wild-card standings.

The Indians defeat the Royals, 5-2. After the game, Cleveland P Kyle Denney
is hit in the right calf by a bullet that comes through the side of the team
bus. He probably avoids more serious injury when the bullet hits the tough
leather of the knee-high boot he is wearing as part of a rookie hazing ritual.

2005
Staving off what would have been one of the worst collapses in baseball
history, the White Sox clinch their first American League Central title
since 2000 beating the Tigers at Detroit's Comerica Park, 4-2. The Pale
Hose had watched their 15-game lead on August 1 shrink to 1 1/2 to the
rampaging Indians.

Jhonny Peralta sets a new club record for homeruns hit by an Indian
shortstop. The 24-year-old's third-inning blast against the Devil Rays
gives the Dominican his 24th round tripper of the season, one more than
Woodie Held hit in 1961.

2006
The Phillies pound the Marlins, 14-2. Shane Victorino leads the 18-hit
Philadelphia attack with 5 safeties, including a 2B and 3B. Pat Burrell
contributes a double and two homers plus two walks.

2007
During the sixth inning of a 5-3 loss to the Blue Jays in Toronto, Devil
Rays manager Joe Maddon pulls Delmon Young out of the line-up for showing
"blatant disrespect" for the game and the team by not running hard to first
base. The 21-year-old outfielder responds with a profanity-laced tirade
claiming he was unfairly singled out and says he will not play in tomorrow's
season finale, making it the only game in the 162-game season he will miss.

One out away from clinching a playoff berth, Padres closer Trevor Hoffman
gives up a game-tying pinch-hit triple to Tony Gwynn Jr, the son of a former
teammate who he used to baby sit. The Padres will lose the game as well as
tomorrow's season finale resulting in a one-game playoff loss to Colorado
that keeps the team out of the postseason.

2010
At the Ballpark in Arlington, with the Seattle-Texas game tied 5-5 with two
outs in the bottom of the ninth, Nelson Cruz strikes out, apparently sending
the game into extra innings. The third strike turns out to be a wild pitch,
and when the catcher makes an errant throw to first base trying to complete
the putout, Mitch Moreland, the base runner already on first, scores the
winning run giving the Rangers a 6-5 victory on a walk-off strikeout.

2013
The Rangers and Rays both win on the last day of the season to force a
one-game tiebreaker for the second AL wild-card spot. Texas, who won its
last seven games, will host Tampa Bay in the 163rd game of the season,
with the winner playing the Indians in a third consecutive do-or-die game.
