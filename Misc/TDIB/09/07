1901
The first-place White Sox dispose of slumping Boston by beating them 4-1
in a Saturday game at South Side Park. Nixey Callahan, enjoying his switch
from the North side to the South side, is the victor over Ted Lewis.

Thankful to be back in New York after losing 3 straight doubleheaders in
Pittsburgh, the Giants play a solo 5-2 win over the Cardinals. Dummy Taylor
is the winner.

1903
The Giants and Superbas split an odd AM-PM doubleheader, with Brooklyn
losing the first game at home, 6-4, then dropping the afternoon game at the
Polo Grounds, 3-0. 9,300 fans show up for the AM game, 23,623 fans show
up for the PM game. The morning contest almost degenerates into a brawl
when batter Jimmy Sheckard interferes with a throw to 2B by Giants catcher
Frank Bowerman by sticking his bat in front of it. The ball deflects off
the bat but umpire Tim Hurst refuses to call interference. While the runner
circles the bases, the Giants ignore the ball and heatedly berate the ump's
call. While no interference is called, Sheckard is tossed out of the game.

1904
Rookie George "Hooks" Wiltse records his 10th straight win without a loss,
and the Giants' 12th in a row, as he beats the Phillies, 6-3. Wiltse allows
8 hits.

1905
The Beaneaters and Giants trade shutouts, with Boston beating Joe McGinnity
in the opener, 1-0, and Christy Mathewson returning the favor, 3-0, in the
nitecap. The game is scoreless until New York scores a run in the 7th off
Vic Willis.

1906
The Cubs continue to roll, beating Pittsburgh, 9-1. Ed Reulbach allows one
hit in the win.

1907
In Boston, Walter Johnson tops the Red Sox and Cy Morgan, 1-0, for the first
of his 38 career 1-0 wins. On the 12th, he will shut out the Highlanders,
2-0. Washington takes the 2nd game, 4-1, to avenge yesterday's Boston sweep.

1908
On Labor Day, Manager Joe Cantillon starts the Big Train in place of one
pitcher who is sick, and another who returned to Washington to be with his
sick wife. Only 3 Senators pitchers made the trip to NY. Johnson shuts out the
New York Highlanders for the 3rd time in 4 days, 4-0, topping Jack Chesbro and
allowing just 2 hits and no walks. In the three games, Walter allows 12 hits,
walks one, and strikes out 12. Johnson will pitch 130 shutouts during his
career, 23 more than runner-up Grover Alexander. This is one of a ML record
(tied in 1942, topped in 1972) 7 shutouts tossed today, out of 16 games.

Brooklyn and Boston match 1-0 shutouts to split a doubleheader. McIntire
and Chappelle are the winning pitchers.

Bob Spade gives Chicago a split by winning game 2, 4-0, over Andy Coakley
of the Reds. In game 1, Jean Dubuc pitches a 2-hitter as the Reds beat host
Chicago, 6-0. Tinker and Evers have the only singles. In 1919, Dubuc will be
banned for life when he fails to report he had prior knowledge of the WS fix.

The Pirates sweep an AM-PM doubleheader against the Cardinals. Honus Wagner
is 5 for 5 in the morning game, a 9-7 win, and 1 for 2 in the afternoon,
a 7-1 victory.

1909
Pitcher Addie Joss hits his only career HR, off Detroit's Ed Summers,
in a 7-4 Cleveland win.

1910
At the Polo Grounds, Christy Mathewson allows 7 hits in beating the Boston
Doves, 2-0. Sam Frock is hung with the loss.

1911
The Cubs' Frank Schulte hits his 21st HR and brings in RBI No. 121 as the
Cubs sweep the Reds, 3-0 and 4-2; he will lead the NL in both homeruns and
ribbies. He is the first player to have more than 20 doubles, triples and HRs
in one season. In the AL, Frank Baker's 9 HRs will be tops. Ty Cobb hits 8 HRs
but leads in BA, RBI, hits, doubles, triples, total bases and stolen bases.

At Boston's South End Grounds, Grover Alexander (24 years old), winning
a rookie record 28 games, pitches the Phils to a 1-0 win over Boston's
44-year-old Cy Young. Alex gives up just one hit. Alexander's 31 CG, 367
IP and 7 shutouts lead the NL. The AL has its own rookie sensation, lefty
Vean Gregg, who breaks in for Cleveland with a 23-7 record and a miserly
1.81 ERA. Gregg will win 20 his first 3 years, then win just 28 in the next
12 years. Next month, Young will end his career after 22 seasons with an
astonishing 511 victories, a major league record unlikely to be broken.

The Giants lose a heartbreaker to Brooklyn in the 9th inning when, with Bert
Tooley on 1B, Jake Daubert lofts a high fly for the apparent 3rd out. But
Fred Snodgrass drops the ball and Tooley scores the final run in the Superbas'
4-3 win. The Giants are virtually tied with the Cubs, winners of two today.

1912
Arthur "Bugs" Raymond, 30, is found dead at the Hotel Valey in Chicago
of a brain hemorrhage, 2 days after his skull was fractured in a barroom
fight. Raymond last pitched for the Giants in 1911, compiling a 6-4 record
before his drinking forced John McGraw to let him go.

With Brad Kocher behind the plate, Eddie Collins steals 6 bases in
the Athletics' 9-7 defeat of Detroit, a post-1900 record that is still
unmatched. Remarkably, on the 22nd, he will repeat with 6 against the
Browns. With 63 for the season, he will run 2nd to Clyde "Deerfoot"
Milan's 88.

1914
The Braves and Giants play an AM-PM twin bill in Boston on Labor Day. To
accommodate the crowds, the Braves have moved their home games to Fenway Park,
courtesy of owner Joe Lannin ... Fenway has triple the seating capacity of
South End Grounds. The two contests draw 74,163 on the day. The Braves, down
4-3 to Mathewson in the 9th, storm back for 2 runs to win the opener. Josh
Devore scratches a single, Herb Moran doubles into the crowd ringing
the outfield, and Johnny Evers slaps a single that eludes George Burns to
drive home the tying and winning runs. Jeff Tesreau wins the nitecap, 10-1,
and the Giants pile on Lefty Tyler. In the Giants' 4-run sixth, Snodgrass
takes a pitch on the sleeve to reach 1B, thumbing his nose at Tyler along
the way. Lefty retaliates by acting out Fred's 1912 muff. When Snodgrass
returns to CF, the crowd is merciless to the point that Boston Mayor Curley
rushes on the field and demands the umpires eject the Giant player. McGraw,
worried that Snodgrass might incur an injury, replaces him.

The Brooklyn Feds score just enough to win a pair over the Pittfeds,
winning 4-3 and 12-11. In the second game, Jim Bluejacket of Brooklyn gets
credit for a win without throwing a pitch (as noted by Frank Vaccaro). The
Brooklyn Eagle reports, "Blue jacket [sic] did not pitch a single ball to
a Pittsburg batter, but even at that he gets credit for winning the second
game. He entered the fray in the eighth inning, with Monasky on third and
Yerkes on first. Bringing his Indian cunning into play, he caught Yerkes
napping off first and ended the inning. In the last half of the same round
the local team scored the five runs that won the game."

Floods severely damage the Kansas City Packers' (FL) ballpark, washing away
fences and demolishing the clubhouse.

1915
The St. Louis Terriers' Dave Davenport, strikeout leader of the FL, pitches a
3-0 no-hitter over the Whales, one of his 10 shutouts and 22 wins. St. Louis
will play 2 more games than Chicago and split them, thus trailing the Whales
at season's end by one percentage point. Chicago will be 86-66; St. Louis,
87-67; and the Pittsburgh Rebels, 86-67. A percentage difference of .004,
it is the closest bunching of the top 3 teams in any ML race.

1916
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants' Ferdie Schupp beats Brooklyn's Nap Rucker,
4-1, to launch New York's record 26-game winning streak. The 'Jints' start
the span two games under .500 and make up nine games in the standings,
but remain in fourth place during the entire streak.

1918
On one day's rest, Hippo Vaughn gives up only 7 hits, but Carl Mays wins
a 2-1 duel. Wally Schang has 2 hits for Boston. Game 3 ends with the Cubs'
Charlie Pick caught in a rundown between 3B and home while trying to score
on a passed ball.

1920
At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees' Carl Mays shuts out the A's on a 4-hitter,
2-0, for his 9th straight win over the A's. Two of the hits are clean and
2 are scratch. Rommel, in relief of losing P Scott Perry, strikes out Ruth,
Pratt and Meusel in the 8th.

At Cleveland's League Park, Jim Bagby tops the Tigers, 5-4, for his 26th
win. The pitcher also doubles, his 8th hit in his last 11 at-bats.

Illinois State Attorney Maclay Hoyne announces he is summoning a grand jury
to investigate charges that the 1919 World Series was fixed. Adding fuel
to the suspicions are recent reports of heavy gambling on the Phillies-Cubs
game of August 31st.

1923
At Shibe Park, the A's are hit with a no-hitter for the 2nd time in 4 days
as Boston's Howard Ehmke strikes out one while pitching a 4-0 no-hitter
against them. "Ehmke's zippy crossfire came out of the shortstop's chest
like bad news from a gatling gun" (Philadelphia Public Ledger). Preserving
the no-hitter is rival pitcher Slim Harriss, who hits the ball to the wall in
the 7th and winds up on 2B, but he is called out for failing to touch 1B. An
8th-inning liner by Frank Welch is fumbled in LF and he reaches 1B. The liner
is initially ruled a single but changed before the inning is over. Ehmke
has now won 6 straight over the A's this season. For Ehmke's batterymate,
Val Picinich, it is his 3rd no-hitter, each with a different team.

1924
The Giants bring a half-game lead into Ebbets Field. With the park already
packed, some 7,000 fans batter down the LF exit gate with a telephone pole
and break into the field. The Giants win the thriller, 8-7, despite 3 Robin
runs in the 9th, and lead Brooklyn by 1 1/2 games.

Behind Carl Mays and Dolf Luque, the Reds sweep a pair from the visiting
Pirates, 4-1 and 4-3. The two teams combine for a ML record as only one
walk is issued in the twinbill.

1925
In an AM-PM doubleheader, the Senators win the morning contest with the A's,
as Johnson tops Lefty Grove, 2-1, and goes 3 for 4, the 2nd consecutive
game he's collected 3 hits. A record crowd of 36,000 watch the A's drop the
afternoon game, 7-6, for their 12th straight defeat. They are now 9 games
in back of Washington.

After apologizing to his teammates yesterday, Babe Ruth makes his first
appearance in a week, collecting one hit in a 5-1 loss to the Red Sox.

1926
The Red Sox lose their 17th game in a row, losing 4-2 to the Yankees.

1927
After blasting 3 HRs in a doubleheader split with the Red Sox yesterday,
Ruth hits 2 today, against Danny MacFayden, in a 12-10 win. This gives him
a ML record-tying 5 in 3 games and he now leads Gehrig 49 HRs to 45. Gehrig
will hit just two more for the year.

1928
The A's take 2 from Boston, winning 1-0 and 7-3, and move into a first-place
tie with the Yankees. Lefty Grove is magnificent in the opener, allowing
4 hits and striking out 11 to win his 14th straight. Red Ruffing takes the
tough loss, allowing an unearned run. Ed Rommel outguns Danny MacFayden in
the nitecap.

The stumbling Yanks drop a pair to the Senators, losing 11-0 and 6-1. Bump
Hadley tosses the shutout and adds three singles. Fred Marberry wins the
nitecap over Waite Hoyt, for his 2nd win over New York in 5 days. New York,
which led by 13 1/2 games on July 1st, is now tied with the A's.

In Philley, the Braves tally 11 hits and 3 walks but still get shut out by
the Phils' Ray Benge, 4-0. In the nitecap, the Braves are hitless until 2
are out in the 7th, then take the lead, but the Phils tie it in the 9th on
Cy Williams' homer. Boston wins in 11, 4-3.

1929
The Cubs increase their NL lead to 13 games by sweeping a pair from Boston,
13-6 and 9-3. Chicago ties a NL mark in the 4th inning of game 1 when 10
batters in a row collect hits. The Cards collected 12 straight hits on
September 17, 1920, but over 2 innings.

The Phils' Lou Koupal pitches 8 innings of shutout ball and beats the Cards,
4-1. Lefty O'Doul has a homer and 2 singles to take over the NL batting
lead at .395. Babe Herman, with 2 hits today, is at .394.

1930
Before 36,000 fans at Sportsman's Park, the Cards sweep 2 from the Reds,
4-2 and 11-6, to leave the Birds just 2 1/2 games in back of the Cubs.

1931
Van Lingle Mungo, Uncle Robby's last find as a pitcher, reports to Brooklyn
from Hartford and shuts out Boston, 2-0, in his first ML start. He fans 7
and hits a triple and a single to drive in both runs. Ancient Tom Zachary
takes the loss. Brooklyn also took the opener, 5-4, in 10 innings on Fresco
Thompson's RBI single.

In the morning game of a doubleheader in Philadelphia, the Yankees begin
with 8 walks and score 8 times in the first inning on only 2 hits. Rommel,
the 4th pitcher in the frame, retires Ruth, Gehrig and Chapman on strikes. The
Yanks win, 15-3. In the 2nd game, Ruth and Gehrig bang 6th-inning homers off
Waite Hoyt, and Ruth adds another blow off Hoyt in the 9th, his 40th. The
Yanks roll, 9-4, over the first-place A's.

The Pirates sweep a holiday pair from the Reds, 6-1 and 4-3, scoring 3 in
the 8th of the p.m. game. The Bucs lose SS Tommy Thevenow when he fractures
his ankle in 2 places sliding in the 6th inning of the opener.

Rookie Johnny Marcum of the Philadelphia A's wins his first ML start with
a shutout, 6-0, over Cleveland.

1934
Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx, heirs to Babe Ruth's HR championship role,
are in battle for the title. Gehrig hits his 44th in Chicago, and Foxx his
41st in Detroit.

1935
Cleveland beats Boston thanks to an unusual triple play. With no outs and
the bases loaded in game 1, and the Indians leading, 5-3, in the 9th, the
Indians bring in Oral Hildebrand to pitch to Joe Cronin. Cronin lines his
first pitch off the side of the head of Cleveland 3B Odell Hale. The ball
caroms to SS Bill Knickerbocker, who throws to 2B Roy Hughes, who throws
to 1B Hal Trosky to finish the triple play ending the game.

Sonny Dunlap, an All-American girls A.A.U. basketball player for the Tulsa
Stenos, is in RF for the Fayetteville Bears in a 5-1 win over Cassville
(Class D Arkansas-Missouri League). It is Fayetville's 2nd to last game of
the year. Ms. Dunlap, a local girl, goes hitless in 3 trips but hits the
ball hard. She is the first woman to play an entire game, and represents the
2nd to play in the minors. She'll make another appearance for Fayetteville
on August 8 of next year, when she plays 2B and goes 1 for 2.

1938
On Joe Cronin Day at Fenway, Jimmie Foxx leads the Red Sox to an 11-4 win
over the Yankees. Double X has 8 RBIs, on 3 hits including a pair of homers
- all in just 5 1/2 innings as the game is called on account of rain. Lou
Gehrig has a pair of singles and each time steals second base. They are
the last 2 steals of his career.

1940
The Tigers trip the Browns, 5-4, scoring three runs in the 9th inning to
win. Hank Greenberg hits his 29th homer of the year, 2nd best in the AL,

With Durocher again at SS, the Dodgers, roll over the Giants, 13-1, behind
Higbe's 20th win of the year. Camilli hits 2 homers as the Brooks pound
Carl Hubbell and 2 relievers. Brooklyn wins the nitecap, 4-3 in 10 innings.

How do you score this? In the 4th of game 2, Boston batter Max West picks
up a short passed ball and flips it to Phils C Livingston who throws to P
Tom Hughes who relays back to the catcher to nail Frank Demaree coming in
from 3B. In the next inning, West is hit in the mouth by a foul ball while
sitting in the dugout and taken to the hospital. West has 3 hits in game
1 as the Braves win twice, 17-6 and 10-1.

1942

rear-ended while they are changing a flat tire. The players were returning
home following a series against the New York Black Yankees.

1944
At Comiskey, the Browns score 3 in the 9th to beat the White Sox, 5-4. The
win puts St. Louis in a tie for first with the idle Yanks.

1945
Facing the Brown's Bob Muncrief, Joe Kuhel hits an inside-the-park
HR into the CF corner, the only homer hit by a Senator all season at
Washington's cavernous Griffith Stadium. The Nats hit 26 more on the
road. The Senators win, 3-2, behind Roger Wolff's 4-hitter. Muncrief also
tosses a 4-hitter. George Case scores the 1st run on a steal of home and
also steals 2B and scores just before Kuhel's HR in the 3rd inning.

Detroit stays 1 1/2 games ahead of Washington by beating the Yankees, 5-0,

1947
Starting P Johnny "Ox" Miller of the Cubs hits a 2nd-inning grand-slam HR,
off Kirbe Higbe, in a 4-3 win over the host Pittsburgh Pirates. But Ox
does not go the required 5 innings and Doyle Lade is the victor. For Ox,
these are the only RBIs of his career.

1949
At Yankee Stadium, Allie Reynolds walks the first 3 Red Sox batters before
Bobby Doerr singles home two runs. But that is all the scoring the Sox can
manage. The Yankees come back to take a 3-2 lead and, after Doerr triples in

with the hitting provided by Bobby Brown (2-run homer) and Billy Johnson
with two triples.

1950
At Detroit's Briggs Stadium, Tiger outfielder Hoot Evers hits for the cycle,
collecting five hits (2 triples), 13 total bases and six RBIs. The left
fielder's tenth-inning single completes the accomplishment, and is part of
a two-run rally that ties the game at 13-13 before the game is called due
to darkness. The game leaves Detroit in first place by a few percentage
points ahead of New York. Rosen and Feller both hit early 2-run homers as
the Indians blow three leads in the game.

1951
In an 18-inning game with the Cubs, the Reds' Lloyd Merriman records 12
putouts in CF, tying the NL mark. The Reds prevail, 7-6. The game is tied at

at Washington. He has now homered in each one of the 15 ML parks, including
Sportsman's Park in St. Louis while in each league (Sportsman Park is used
by both the Cardinals and Browns). Mize joins Heath as the only players to
homer in every park in their league in one season. Mize also connected in
each NL park in 1937, 1940 and 1947.

OF Don Grate of Chattanooga sets a record for a long toss of a baseball
in Chattanooga's Engel Stadium, with a throw of just one inch better than
434 feet, breaking a 42-year-old mark set by Larry LeJeune on October 9,
1910. Grate will improve his own record to 443 feet 3 1/2 inches on August
23, 1953. While playing in the PCL, Rocky Colavito attempts to break the
record on July 1, 1956, but tops out at 435 feet 10 inches.

In the Tri-State League playoffs against Anderson, Charlotte's Dean Stone
follows teammate Bob Danielson's no-hitter with one of his own, winning

the year.

1953
Campanella sets the ML record for RBIs by a catcher when he smacks a 3-run

beating the Giants, 9-7 and 5-3. Eddie Pellagrini has 4 hits, including a HR,
to back Bob Friend in the opener. Paul LaPalme is the winner in the nitecap
as the Bucs beat Jim Hearn for the 1st time after 12 straight defeats to
him. His last lost to Pittsburgh was exactly 6 years ago today.

1954

in Griffith Stadium history. The Senators win, 5-4.

1955
Whitey Ford continues his mastery with his AL-record 2nd consecutive
one-hitter, beating the A's, 2-1. Jim Finigan hits a 2-out single in the
7th for the A's only hit. Ford is the 5th ML pitcher to throw consecutive
one-hitters. Arnie Portocarrero is the hard-luck loser. In his last start,
'Slick' held the Senators hitless with the exception of a seventh-inning
bloop by Carlos Paula.

Cleveland's Early Wynn stops the Orioles on 5 hits and wins, 6-0. It is
his 200th career win on the way to 300. Larry Doby supplies the offense

win, 1-0, on Ken Boyer's homerun off Joe Nuxhall.

The Giants and Dodgers split a pair with New York winning the opener, 6-2,
on a pair of homeruns by Willie Mays. Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 3-1,
on Carl Furillo's 2-out homer in the 11th. Don Newcombe wins his 23rd,
the most by a Dodger since Dazzy Vance in 1924. The win gives Brooklyn a
tie for 2nd with the Reds.

1959
At Fenway, the trio of Don Buddin, P Jerry Casale, and Pumpsie Green tie a
ML record by belting consecutive HRs in the 2nd off Bob Turley to pace the
Sox to a 12-4 drubbing of New York. Andy Carey pinch hits a HR in the 3rd,
and Mantle adds one the same inning, but little else happens for New York,
which loses its first season-series with the Sox in 11 years.

In the 2nd of two at Baltimore, the Senators score 7 runs in the 10th to
win, 8-1, and earn a split. The big blow is Ron Samford's 3-run homer off
Ernie Johnson, which comes in his last ML at-bat. He'll get into four more
games, and have a sac fly, but this is his last official appearance. The
Birds win the opener, 7-0, behind Bill O'Dell's 4-hitter.

The Indians win a pair of come-from-behind victories over the Tigers, 15-14
and 6-5. Jim Piersall's 2-run single in the 9th ices the game-1 win. Rocky

the Bengals.

At Comiskey Park, the baseball competition in the Pan Am games finishes
with Venezuela winning the gold, followed by Puerto Rico (silver) and the
USA (bronze). Collegian Lou Brock is 1 for 10 for the US. Dominican Rico
Carty so impresses the scouts that, according to Rob Ruck (The Tropic of
Baseball), he is offered 9 contracts and signs them all. For the record,
Carty signs with the Braves in December.

1960
At Crosley Field, Frank Robinson homers in the 15th inning as the Reds
