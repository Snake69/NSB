1902
In Philadelphia, 17,291 see the Athletics beat Baltimore twice, 9-5 and 5-4,
while 172 watch the Phils play Pittsburgh. With the A's 1902 attendance
almost 4 times that of the Phillies, and the AL planning to oppose the weak
Giants in New York, pressure mounts among NL directors for peace talks. The
A's bring Rube Waddell in for 8 innings of relief in the opening win. Rube
comes back to pitch another two innings of relief in the nitecap to pick
up his 2nd win for the day. It won't happen again until 1915.

Billy Wolfe, half brother of the Reds' Bill Phillips, makes his only ML
appearance pitching for the Phillies. He loses to Pittsburgh and Jesse
Tannehill, 5-1.

1904
The A's Eddie Plank and Boston's Cy Young face each other, with the Athletics
ace prevailing, 1-0, in 13 innings. It is his 3rd 1-0 win this season,
a mark he will match next year.

A crowd of 15,250 cheer the first-place Giants to a pair of one-run wins
over the Phillies. Bresnahan's 9th inning triple scores 2 in the opener,
as Hooks Wiltse earns his 11th straight win. Dummy Taylor wins the nitecap,
6-5, as the Giants finish 4 straight doubleheaders with 5 victories, a loss
and a tie. New York leads the 2nd-place Colts by 17 games.

1906
At Chicago, the Tigers down the White Sox, 2-1. A potential Sox rally is
stopped in the 9th when leadoff batter George Davis seemingly bunts safely
but is called out by ump Billy Evans. Evans' call is greeted with a shower
of bottles.

1907
In a Bowler's Day contest on an off day for the Reds in Cincinnati, a field
day event draws long throwers from around the country, but none top Johnny
Hatfield's 19th Century mark set in 1872. Sheldon LeJeune of Springfield
(Central L) wins the long toss with a throw of 399' 10 3/4". Art Hostetler
of the St. Louis Cardinals is 2nd with a throw of 385' 8". The Bucs' George
Gibson wins the throwing to 2B competition. Jack Thoney of Toronto wins the
'beating out a fair bunt' competition in 3.15 seconds. Mike Mitchell of
the Reds wins the fungo-hitting contest with 413' 8 1/2". Harry McIntire
is 2nd with 411' 1". Ed Walsh, with a travel day for the White Sox, is 3rd
at 385'. Walter Clements of Jersey City circles the bases in 14.15 seconds.

1908
Detroit takes its 2nd straight extra-inning game from the White Sox, 6-5
in 11 innings, and the Indians beat the Browns, 5-2. The AL race leaves
Detroit 75-52, Chicago 72-57, St. Louis 71-57.

Louie Durham of the Indianapolis Browns pitches and wins both ends of a
doubleheader against the Toledo Mud Hens. Historian Fred Schuld notes that
this is the 5th doubleheader this season where Durham has accomplished this
feat. Previously he beat the Milwaukee Brewers (June 14), Columbus Champs
(July 18), St. Paul Saints (July 25), and the Louisville Night Riders
(August 8).

1912
Boston's Smoky Joe Wood wins his 15th straight, with 9th-inning relief help
from Sea Lion Hall, beating the White Sox, 5-4. He scatters 12 hits and
strikes out 5. There is some question about which pitcher should receive
credit for the win, but AL president Ban Johnson will rule in favor of Wood.

Philadelphia A's rookie Stan Coveleski makes his first appearance in the
majors and shuts out Detroit, 3-0.

At St. Louis, Browns starter Earl Hamilton retires the first batter in the
6th against the Yankees then plunks three successive hitters - Ed Sweeney,
George McConnell and Tommy McMillan - to load the bases. Mark Allison then
replaces him and Hal Chase lines into a DP to end the inning. The Yankees
win, 8-3. As noted by Mike Grahek in 2007, the three hit by pitched balls
in an inning is a record in the AL.

1913
Honus Wagner is given a souvenir bat carved from a piece of wood taken from
naval hero Oliver Perry's flagship Niagara, which was sunk in Lake Erie
100 years before. The Giants then sink the Pirates, 5-2. Pittsburgh pitcher
George McQuillan is thrown out at first base after lining a one-hopper to
New York RF Red Murray.

1915
Rogers Hornsby, brought up a week earlier from class D Denison (Western
Association), makes his ML debut for the Cardinals. With the Cards trailing
the Reds, 7-0, after 6 innings, Hornsby plays SS and goes hitless in two
appearances against Cincy rookie Charles "King" Lear, who wins, 7-1.

Boston's Babe Ruth wins his 15th of the year, stopping the visiting A's,
7-2, on six hits. Ruth, 3rd in the AL in hitting, is 0 for 4 at the plate.

St. Louis (FL) pitcher Dave Davenport follows up his no-hitter with a
2-hitter, beating Newark, 3-0.

1917
A red-hot Grover Alexander, chasing thirty wins, beats the Braves, 5-2,
for the Phils.

1918
Players on both sides threaten to strike unless they are guaranteed $2,500
to the winners and $1,000 each for the losers. They back off, however,
when told they will appear greedy while their countrymen are fighting a
war. There are no fines, but no WS rings or mementos are given out this
year. On the field, Hippo Vaughn comes back with 2 days rest and blanks
the Red Sox, 3-0, on 5 hits in game 5.

1919
The Indians' Ray "Slim" Caldwell, struck by lightning 2 weeks earlier,
no-hits his former teammates, the Yankees, 3-0, at the Polo Grounds. He uses
a spitball effectively in facing just 29 batters. Carl Mays takes the loss
giving up 6 hits including a 2-run homer by Joe Harris. In the 2nd game,
the Indians win as well, 3-2. Peckinpaugh accepts another 20 chances in the
twinbill. Caldwell, released by the Red Sox in July, finishes the season
winning five of six starts for the Tribe with an ERA of 1.71.

1920
Cleveland loses, 6-1, to the Yanks as Ruth hits a 2-run homer. Shortstop
Joe Sewell, brought up from the New Orleans Pelicans, makes his ML debut,
filling in for the injured Harry Lunte. Sewell goes hitless, but will then
go 10 for 22 to win the job for the decade. Cleveland now leads by percentage
points over the White Sox, and a half-game ahead of the 3rd-place Yankees.

1921
Catcher Wally Schang has 5 of the Yankees' 21 hits as the New Yorkers wallop
the A's, 19-3. A ML record-tying five Yankees collect two hits in the
9th inning:  Schang, Mays, Miller, Peckinpaugh and Ruth. Ruth's 2nd hit,
a single, hits Peck for the 3rd out. Winning P Carl Mays gives up 13 hits
to Philadelphia in winning his 16th straight over them.

The Indians split a pair with St. Louis, losing 2-0 in game 1 and winning
10-2 in game 2. Bill Wambganss has half the total with 5 runs scored.

1922
The Yankees play their farewell home game in the Polo Grounds. An estimated
40,000 overflow the stadium with another 25,000 turned away. Joe Bush beats
the Philadelphia A's, 10-3, in the opener and Waite Hoyt edges the A's in the
second, 2-1. Plans are in the works to expand the park to 56,000 capacity,
but this is the last regular season AL game at the Polo Grounds. The Yanks
will play their next 18 games on the road, and then open in Yankee Stadium
next spring.

Beals Becker of Kansas City (AA) is 8 for 8 in a doubleheader against
Minneapolis.

1924
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants rip the Braves, 22-1, in the opener of a
doubleheader. Frankie Frisch goes 6 for 6 before grounding out. They let
up a bit in game 2, winning just 8-0, behind George McQuillan.

1925
Bob Meusel, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig hit successive homers in the 4th inning
of game one versus the A's, all off Sammy Gray. New York wins, 7-3. Then,
Ruth and OF Ben Paschal hit back-to-back homers in the 4th of game 2,
but New York loses, 5-4.

Cleveland splits a pair with Detroit, losing the 1st by a 6-1 score, then
taking the 2nd game, 7-2, behind Garland Buckeye. Buckeye hits a pair of
homers to help his cause.

1926
In the Browns' 5-4 win over the White Sox, pitcher Win Ballou stops Harry
McCurdy's consecutive hit streak at 10. Win also wins.

1927
The Yankees win their 21st game of the year against the Browns, but it doesn't
come easy. New York wins, 1-0. Wilcey Moore outduels Stewart. Lazzeri scores
in the 8th after hitting a double, followed by successive sacrifices.

The Cards take advantage of the Giants' loss to Chicago by turning back
the Robins, 5-2, behind Pete Alexander's 19th win. Pete allows just 2 hits
through 7 innings before allowing a score.

At Pittsburgh, Ray Kremer shuts out the Phils, 4-0, to preserve Pitt's slim
lead in the NL. Ulrich is the loser.

1928
The Giants gain 1 1/2 games on the Cards and Cubs by winning two from Boston
while the leaders lose. New York moves into 2nd tomorrow with another sweep
of the Braves. Fred Fitzsimmons wins the opener for the Giants, 4-1, and
Joe Genewich wins the nitecap, 11-0.

1930
Forty-one-year-old Dolf Luque hands the Cubs another whitewash as Brooklyn
wins, 6-0. Chicago's lead over the Cards and Brooklyn is now 1 1/2 games.

Detroit's Vic Sorrell beats the A's, 4-0, for the AL's last shutout this
season. The 41 shutouts is a major league low.

1932
Dodger OF Johnny Frederick hits his record 6th pinch-hit HR of the season. It
is a dramatic 9th-inning 2-run shot that beats Burleigh Grimes and the Cubs,
4-3. Frederick's 6 pinch-hit HRs doubles the previous record of 3 held by
Ham Hyatt in 1913, Cy Williams in 1928, and Pat Crawford in 1929. With just
9 pinch-hits altogether, his HR percentage is a ML record.

1933
The inaugural East-West All-Star game is played at Comiskey Park, the site
of the first major league All-Star game played exactly one month ago. Gus
Greenlee and Tom Wilson's idea to showcase the black talent in the Negro
Leagues draws 20,000 fans helping to relieve some of the burden facing the
financially-strapped club owners. Willie Foster goes the distance in the
West's 11-7 victory.

1934
Dizzy Dean wins his 25th game, beating the Phillies, 4-1. It is the 5th
straight for the Cards, now 4 games behind.

Burleigh Grimes, in his second stint with the Pirates this year, picks up
his 270th win, in relief, as the Pirates beat the Giants, 9-7. It is the
Hall of Famer's last ML win.

A Detroit rabbi solves a dilemma for slugger Hank Greenberg by declaring
that the slugger can play baseball on Rosh Hashanah, because the Jewish
New Year is a happy occasion. It is for the contending Tigers, winners
today over the Red Sox, 2-1. Greenberg performs a mitzvah by belting two
solo homers off Gordon Rhodes. Tomorrow's Detroit Free Press will headline
"happy New Year" in Yiddish.

1935
Washington's Buck Newsom scatters six hits to shut out the leading Tigers,
6-0. Schoolboy Rowe pitches 6 innings to take the loss.

Chicago beat the Braves, 4-0, behind Charlie Root for their 7th straight
win. Freddie Lindstrom is the batting star with a double and single to drive
home a pair as Chicago stays a game behind the Cardinals and 1 1/2 ahead
of the Giants. The Giants win a pair today, 4-3 and 4-2, over the Pirates,
while the Cards score 3 in the 8th to edge the Phils, 4-2.

The Browns triumph, 8-6, over the A's, handing the Mackmen their 13th
straight loss. Foxx is 2 for 3 for the A's, while Carey and Coleman each
have three hits for the Browns.

1936
With his Cards trailing, 2-1, going into the 9th at Boston, manager Frankie
Frisch hits a pinch single to start the inning, Spud Davis drives the pinch
runner home with a pinch double. Mike Ryba, running for Davis, scores the
winning run, and catches the 9th as Dizzy Dean retires the side. For the
slow-footed Davis, it is his 26th double of the year, 2 more doubles than
runs scored. With 32 doubles and 30 runs scored in 1931, Davis is the only
player with more than 100+ games to have more doubles than runs scored. The
only other player with fewer runs than two baggers will be Rusty Staub, in his
pinch hitting days with the Mets ... he racks up 6 doubles and 5 runs in 1983.

1938
Jimmie Foxx of the Red Sox hits 2 HRs in a game for the 9th time this season,
breaking a record held by Babe Ruth and Hack Wilson. Lynn Nelson of the A's
serves up the homers in a 15-7 win at Fenway. The Sox have just a makeup
game at Fenway left with all their remaining games on the road. Foxx has
now hit 35 homers at home, the most ever hit at Fenway.

At Wrigley Field, Frank McCormick has 5 hits to lead the Reds to a 9-1 win
over the Cubs.

1939
Detroit's Bobo Newsom beats the White Sox, 5-1, and, as noted by historian
Lyle Spatz, stops Johnny Rigney's consecutive win streak of 11 games. Rigney's
mark is a club record that will be tied (Gary Peters, 1963) and finally
topped by LaMarr Hoyt (13 in one season) and Wilson Alvarez, both with 15
over 2 seasons.

The Reds' Paul Derringer wins his 20th, beating the host Cubs, 7-2.

1940
Boston's Lefty Grove slows the Tigers, beating Bobo Newsom, 6-5, in 13
innings. It is Lefty's 2nd 13-inning win in succession. The win puts
Cleveland back in first by .001.

Hitting against Washington's Ken Chase, Chicago's Bob Kennedy, with 2 on
and no outs in the 9th, lines into a triple play to end the game, a 5-2 win
for the Nats. It's the Nats' 2nd triple play of the year. In his previous
at-bat in the game, Kennedy hit into a DP, and will do the same tomorrow
in his first at-bat.

In a twinbill loss to the Pirates, the Phils lose catcher Ben Warren when
he suffers a brain concussion after being hit by a pitch from Luke Sewell
in game 2. The Pirates sweep, 11-3 and 11-1, with the wins going to Joe
Bowman and Rip Sewell.

Former ML infielder Sam Crane, serving time for the 1930 murder of his
former sweetheart and her boyfriend, starts parole proceedings.

1941
In Chicago, Johnny Schmitz makes his pitching debut and notches a victory by
throwing only one pitch in the 9th inning, hit for a double play by Cookie
Lavagetto. The Cubs then rally for 3 runs and win 5-4 over the Brooklyn
Dodgers. The Cubs win the nitecap, 5-3, and the two losses, combined with
the Cards sweep of the Phils, cut Brooklyn's lead to one game.

1942
Brooklyn, with a slim 3-game lead in the NL, loses to Chicago's Lon Warneke,
10-2. Across the river at the Polo Grounds, lefty Howie Pollet gives the
Cards a 5-1 win over New York. Hubbell was the announced starter, but in
pre-game warm ups he was hit on the head by an errant throw from Musial. Hal
Schumacher was inserted as the starter but gave up 3 first-inning runs to
earn an early shower.

1944
The Red Sox and Yankees split a pair at Fenway, the Sox taking the opener,
3-2, and the Yankees the nitecap, 4-3. Metkovich has hits in both games
to run his consecutive game hitting streak to 25 games, a new Red Sox
record. Metkovich hit .407 during his streak, but will end the year at
.277. Dom DiMaggio will top Catfish's mark.

The Cubs and Cards split a pair, with Erickson shutting out the Redbirds,
9-0, in the opener. St. Louis takes the nitecap, 4-2, behind Cooper, but
Redbird fans get a score when Garms and Musial collide in the outfield. Musial
leaves on a stretcher and will miss 11 days.

1947
Al Brazle hurls the Cards to their 9th win in 10 games, stopping the Phils,
4-1, on 4 hits, 3 by Adams. Dutch Leonard takes the loss. In the 9th,

flies out.

1948
The visiting Yankees whip first-place Boston, 11-6, on Joe DiMaggio's
10th-inning grand slam, off sidearmer Earl Caldwell. Both DiMaggios have
3 hits, but Joe has 5 RBIs. Boston's lead is cut to 2 1/2 games over New
York, with Cleveland 3 1/2 back of Boston after beating Detroit, 10-1,
behind Gene Bearden.

1949
At Philadelphia, Red Sox lefty Mel Parnell tops the A's, 9-1, for his 22nd
victory of the year.

Stan Musial's 29th homer, coming with 2 on and 2 out in the 9th, gives
the Cardinals a 6-5 win over the Reds, protecting their one game lead. The
Cards collect just 5 hits off Howie Fox, but use 6 walks and 3 errors.

1950
Joe DiMaggio becomes the first player to hit 3 HRs in one game at spacious
39-year-old Griffith Stadium, as the Yanks beat Washington, 8-1. It is the
third time that Joltin' Joe has hit a trio of round-trippers in a game,
but he has never accomplished the feat at Yankee Stadium. Joe also adds an
RBI double, to pass the 100-ribbie mark for the 9th time. The Senators lead
the 2nd game, 6-2, when rain washes it out in the 4th. New York is now a
half-game in back of the leaders with Boston a half-game behind the Yankees.

The Red Sox win their 22nd in a row at home from the Athletics, 6-2,
a streak dating back to 1949. The Red Sox won all 11 games two years in a row.

San Francisco (PCL) lefty Al Lien throws a 17-inning 1-0 shutout over the
Hollywood Stars.

1952
Although errors by Smalley and Jackson account for 7 unearned runs, the
Cubs loose a 15-hit attack to beat the Dodgers, 11-7. Bob Rush wins his 4th
against Brooklyn with no defeats. The Brooks' margin is now 3 1/2 games
over the Giants. Hank Sauer drives in 3 runs with 3 hits, including his
37th homer of the year. Hammerin' Hank is leading the NL, but his homer
today is his last. Ralph Kiner will tie Sauer for the NL homer title.

1953
Giants rookie Al Worthington walks 11 Cardinals to lose, 7-6, his 8th straight
loss since winning his first two games by shutouts. Enos Slaughter's homer
helps the Cards score 3 in the 8th inning to win.

1954
Braves 1B Joe Adcock's HR against the Dodgers in Ebbets Field breaks the NL
mark of 9 HRs hit on the road against one club. Adcock's HR is the Braves'
only hit, as Billy Loes one-hits the Braves, 2-1, in a 4 1/2 inning game
halted by rain. NL prexy Warren Giles rules from his home after 2 AM that
it is an official game, after ump Goetz declined to rule whether the game
was official or suspended. The loss ends the Braves' 10-game win streak,
their 3rd 10-game win skein of the year.

Attempting to handle Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball against the Redlegs, C
Ray Katt of the Giants sets an ML record with 4 passed balls in the 8th
inning. Wilhelm faces just 5 batters in the frame, yielding a single and
two walks, as passed balls allow two runners to score. When Wilhelm winds
up with 2 out and Bobby Adams on 3B, Adams races home, expecting Katt to
make his 5th passed ball. Roy McMillan swings and misses, and Katt holds
on and tags out the red-faced Adams. Cincinnati wins, 8-1.

1955
OF Hank Bauer of the Yankees, pressed into emergency service as a catcher,
permits a passed ball, setting up the winning run in a 9-8 loss to the
White Sox.

1956
The Red Sox sign 2B Gene Mauch after he was released by Los Angeles
(PCL). Mauch hit .348 in 144 games for L.A.

The White Sox sign 16-year-old California pitcher Jim Derrington to a bonus
of $50,000-$60,000. The bonus baby will have to stay on the Sox roster for
2 years and will debut this month.

1957
Tied at the end of regulation, the Cards strand 11 runs in extra innings
before Boyer singles in a run in the 14th. St. Louis wins, 4-3, tagging
reliever Robin Roberts with his 20th loss.

1958
In Cleveland, 50,021 fans turn out for "Back the Indians" night. It is
Cleveland's largest crowd since 1955, but the Yankees dampen the enthusiasm
with an 8-3 win.

Dick Stuart clouts a 10th-inning homer to give Bob Friend his 20th win of
the year as the Pirates beat the Giants, 6-4.

1959
Mickey Mantle goes 5 for 6, including a HR, in a 12-1 romp over Kansas
City's Ray Herbert.

Brothers Jim and Ed Bailey form the battery for the Cincinnati Reds in the
2nd game of a doubleheader against the Cubs. Jim is lifted in the 8th inning
and charged with the 6-3 loss in his ML debut.

1960
In Detroit, Mantle unloads a cannon shot for 3 runs in the 6th inning,
the ball clearing the RF roof and landing in the Brooks Lumber Yard across
Trumbull Avenue. New York pins a 5-1 loss on Paul Foytack that moves them a
half-game in first place ahead of Baltimore, losers today. In June, 1985,
Mantle's blow was retroactively measured at 643 feet, and will be listed
in The Guinness Book of World Records at that distance.

1961
The Yankees sweep the Indians, 7-6 and 9-3, their 12th win in a row at home
and the Indians 20th loss in a row at Yankee Stadium. Mantle gets number 53
in the nitecap, while Maris, homerless, stays at 56. The official scorecard
credits Mantle with 2 runs scored ... it will be discovered in 1995 that
one of the runs should go to Bill Skowron. In the 2nd game, Clete Boyer
sends a Jim Perry pitch into the LF corner that hits the lower deck of the
grand stand and bounces back into play. While home plate ump Joe Linsalata
calls it a HR, the other two umps agree with Tribe CF Jimmy Piersall who
contends the ball is in play. Boyer's home run trot is interrupted at 3B
with a tag out. Piersall's contribution in game one is fighting with a fan
who climbed onto the field.

The Reds' Bob Purkey allows just 2 hits in beating the visiting Cards, 5-2.

At Chicago, the Phillies score 7 in the 7th, including Don Demeter's grand
slam, and notch 6 more in the 8th to beat the Cubs, 14-6. There is some
solace for the Cubs as they introduce a pair of gems:  Ken Hubbs debuts with
2 hits and 2 runs and Lou Brock has one hit, one run and a pair of errors.

1962
Against Hank Aguirre, Mantle clouts a 4th-inning homerun, the 400th of his
career, to tie the game, 1-1. The Yanks score 2 in the 9th off Aguirre to
beat Detroit, 3-1. The victory, combined with a Minnesota loss, gives the
Yanks a 3 1/2 game lead over the Twins. The surprising Angels are in 3rd
place, 4 games back.

The Angels' Dean Chance loses his no-hit bid when Zoilo Versalles singles
in the 8th inning for the only Twins hit. Chance wins, 5-0.

1963
In the first inning of a rout of the Cubs at Sportsman's Park, Cardinals
left fielder Stan Musial becomes the first grandfather in big league history
to hit a homerun. The 42-year-old new grandpa accomplishes the feat in his
first at-bat since the birth of his grandson earlier in the day. Bob Gibson
(17-8) blanks the Cubs, 8-0.

At New York, the Giants trail, 3-0, after 7 innings when manager Alvin Dark
sends up consecutive Alous to bat in the 8th. Pinch hitter Jesus grounds out,
pinch hitter Matty strikes out, and leadoff hitter Felipe bounces back to
P Carlton Willey. The Dominican trio becomes the first three siblings to
bat consecutively in the same inning. The Giants lose, 4-2. McCovey's 38th
homer and Cepeda's 29th account for the SF scoring.

1964
With his office being responsible for all of the costs for teams not making
it into the postseason, MLB commissioner Ford Frick authorizes the Phillies,
Yankees, White Sox and Orioles to print tickets for the World Series. Due
to a historic late-season collapse by Philadelphia, the surging Cardinals
win the National League pennant on the last day of the season, and will
play the Bronx Bombers in the Fall Classic.

The Phils split a 2-game series with the Cards and build a 6-game lead in
the NL on Chris Short's 5-1 win. Short strikes out 12 throwing no curves
to win his 16th. A pivotal play is 3B Dick Allen's stop and throw out of
Javier's sharp grounder with 2 men on in the 2nd.

Baltimore tops the Senators, 12-5, despite Brooks Robinson hitting into his
2nd triple play. Brooks will hit into a record 4 TPs by the time he hangs
up his glove.

1965
Phils rookie Ferguson Jenkins debuts with 4 1/3 innings of relief against
the Cardinals and picks up his first victory. Philadelphia wins, 5-4,
in 12 innings. It is the Phillies 10,000th game decision since 1900.

The Orioles sweep a pair from Kansas City, 5-2 and 10-5. In game 2, the
O's get consecutive HRs by in the 8th from Brooks Robinson, Blefary and Adair.

1966
Cardinal P Dick Hughes tops the Pirates on Tim McCarver's bases-load hit
off the RF wall. Pittsburgh falls a game in back of the Dodgers.

1967
At Candlestick Park, San Francisco hurler Gaylord Perry's 40-inning team
record consecutive scoreless streak comes to an end as the Cubs score an
unearned run in the seventh inning of a 2-1 victory over Fergie Jenkins
and the Cubs. The future Hall of Famer will match his franchise mark with
another string of scoreless innings in 1970.

Joel Horlen revives Chicago pennant hopes with a 5-0 no-hit win against the
Tigers. Detroit hits only two balls to the outfield. Behind the pitching
of Cisco Carlos with help from Wilhelm and Bob Locker, the Sox win game 2
by a 4-0 score to move a game behind the 2nd-place Red Sox.

Minnesota leads the tight AL race after edging the Orioles, 4-2, at Baltimore.

1968
Billy Williams hits 3 HRs in a game for the first time in his career. It's
all the Cubs' scoring, as they beat the Mets, 3-1, behind Bill Hands. Adding
to two HRs on September 8th, Williams has a ML-record-tying 5 over two
straight games.

Don Wilson, who struck out 18 Reds on July 14, fans 16 Reds today while
pitching the Astros to a 3-2 win in game 1. The Reds win the nitecap, 4-3.

1969
The Cubs drop a 6-2 decision to the Phils, and drop to 2nd place, one game in
back of New York. The Cubs are out of first place after 155 days atop the NL
East. Chicago will continue to swoon and finish the month with a 9-17 record.

Meanwhile the Mets sweep the Expos, 3-2 and 7-1. Ken Boswell's single in the
12th wins the opener. Taylor in relief of Jim McAndrew, who pitches the first
11 innings, is the winner. Mike Wegener matches McAndrew for 11 innings,
striking out 15 Mets. In the night cap, the Mets score 6 runs in the 3rd
to knock out starter Reed. The winner is Nolan Ryan (6-1), who gives up 3
hits and fans 11. The Mets' two wins puts them into first place by a game,
the 1st time ever the team has been atop the NL.

Using a ML record 27 players in one game, the Royals lose, 11-4, at
California. Andy Messersmith faces 20 different batters in the complete-game
win, while KC uses 6 pitchers. Bubba Morton plays just 3 innings but drives
in 5 runs.

1970
Cleveland whips the Senators, 13-4. Frank Howard, with no walks today,
hits 2 homers for Washington. Cleveland pitchers will walk Howard 30 times
this season, 12 intentionally.

Lee May hits a 1st-inning grand slam, off Joe Moeller, and the Reds roll
to a 13-4 win over the host Dodgers.

their only other baserunner. He was caught stealing, so Martinez faces just

2008
In a 3-2 Astros loss at Citizens Bank Park, Charlton Jimerson, pinch hitting

history to hit a homerun in his first major league at-bat.

With a 4-2 victory over the visiting Yankees, the Angels clinch the
division flag on the earliest date in the history of the American League
West. The Halos, the first club this season to secure a post-season spot,

2013
With three doubles and a homerun, Mark Trumbo ties a franchise record with
four extra-base hits and becomes the first player in Angels' history to
