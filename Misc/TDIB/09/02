1901
Detroit sweeps a Labor Day doubleheader from Washington, picking up an
AL-record 21 infield assists in game 2. This is still the AL record. SS
Kid Elberfeld has 12 assists to back up Roscoe Miller.

1902
With Harry Bay and Bill Bradley scoring 5 runs each, Cleveland pounds the
Orioles, 23-7, collecting 23 hits off Bird pitcher Jack Katoll, a 10-game
winner with the White Sox last season. Katoll goes the route.

1903
Mathewson walks 3 Superbas in the first inning and all score as Brooklyn

until the 9th.

1906
In Chicago, the Sox edge Cleveland, 2-1, but lose C Sullivan when he is hit
on the thumb with a foul tip. The Sox will journey to Cleveland, losing a
twinbill there tomorrow.

Ty Cobb is back in the Detroit lineup for the first time in 6 weeks. He
has a single and a steal, but he misplays a Charley Hemphill flyball into a
homerun, and the Tigers lose, 1-0, to the Browns' Barney Pelty. Rain stops
the game after 7 innings.

1907
Detroit's Ty Cobb has 3 steals in a 6-5 win in an A.M. game. Detroit loses
the 2nd game, 4-2.

The Giants and Dodgers play a scoreless 12 innings on a wet ball field. Red
Ames and George "Farmer" Bell are the pitchers. They play 2 tomorrow.

1908
In Philadelphia, Frank Corridon goes all the way to defeat Brooklyn, 2-1
in 17 innings. Corridon does not walk a batter.

Pittsburgh's Lefty Leifield pitches a complete-game victory, 8-2, over
the Reds to leave the 2nd place Pirates just percentage points behind New
York. The Bucs steal 6 bases including Fred Clarke's steal of home.

1909
Detroit beats Boston, 8-5, and completes a sweep of every series against
visiting Eastern teams, winning their 14th in a row. The Tigers regain
first place by a half-game enroute to their 3rd straight pennant.

Boston's Cliff Curtis pitches his first ML game and beats the Pirates, 1-0,
to give the Doves their only win against Pittsburgh this year. The Pirates
win the nightcap and will finish the season 20-1 against Boston.

For the 2nd day in a row, Giants outfielder Bill O'Hara is a pinch runner
and swipes two bases. Today's thefts come in the 9th inning of a 5-2 loss
to the Cardinals. Yesterday he did it in the 6th of a 9-6 win over the
Cards. He is the first to accomplish this ML record, and he is the only
one this century to do it twice.

1912
Washington's Walter Johnson goes 10 innings against the A's, who beat the
Big Train, 9-7.

In a rainy doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, Red Sox ace Joe Wood tops
the Yankees in the nitecap, 1-0, for his 30th win and his 13th straight
victory. It is Wood's 8th shutout and 2nd in a row. Boston takes the opening
squeaker, 2-1, to finish the year in New York with 10 wins in 10 tries. With
3 wins last year, and 5 wins in their first 5 road games with New York in
1913, Boston will set the since-tied ML record for most consecutive wins
on the road against one team (18).

At Boston, Mathewson wins both games for the Giants in a 5-2, 6-1 sweep
of the Braves. In the opener, Matty relieves Marquard in the 9th with the
score 2-2 and tosses 3 shutout innings. Larry Doyle ends it with a 3-run
homer in the 12th. Matty coasts to his 19th win in the nitecap after the
Giants chase Ed Doheny with 5 runs in the 3rd.

Brooklyn's Tex Erwin cracks a 9th-inning homer off Alexander to tie, and
the Superbas tip the Phils, 2-1 in 11 innings. In the nitecap, Eppa Rixey
outpitches Nap Rucker to give the Quakers a 2-1 win in 12 innings. Rucker
will lose 20 (18-21) this year after winning 20 (22-18) last season.

1914
The NL lead seesaws. Beaten by Brooklyn, 6-2, while the Braves win twice,
the Giants drop out of first place for the first time since May 30. Tomorrow
they sweep 2 from Brooklyn and retake the top spot.

1915
The visiting Phillies sweep two from the Giants, winning 3-1 and 2-0. Tesreau
and Mathewson take the losses, while Pete Alexander is the shutout winner
in the nitecap.

Ruth is hitless at bat, but pitches the Red Sox to an 8-3 win over the host
Athletics. He strikes out 5.

1917
The first place White Sox take a pair from the Tigers, winning 7-2 and
6-5. The Sox bunch four in the 1st and three more in the 3rd to make
the shine ball's leading proponent, Ed Cicotte, a winner over Willie
Mitchell. In the nitecap, the Sox snap a tie in the 9th when Eddie Collins,
with one stolen base already, swipes 2B and 3B after a walk. Jackson's sac
fly brings him home.

1918
Brooklyn ends the abbreviated season by splitting a doubleheader with the
Phils, losing the 1st game, 4-2, before taking the nitecap, 5-3. Zack Wheat
leads the NL with a .335 average and is only player to ever win a batting
title and hit no homeruns.

In Washington, the Senators end the year on a light note, by splitting with
the A's. Philadelphia wins the opener and the Nats take the nitecap, 8-3. The
2nd game is Washington's traditional year-end laugher, and 43-year-old coach
Nick Altrock finishes in relief, one of his 5 appearances in 1918. Altrock
bats in the bottom of the 8th and Wickey McAvoy, a catcher playing first
for the day, comes in to throw. Altrock finally lines one of his lobs into
the outfield, rambles around the bases and - according to Al Kermisch's
description - neglects 2B and 3B. Ump Billy Evans calls Altrock safe at the
plate for the only homer by a Senator hit at home this season. For Altrock,
it's been 14 years since his last round tripper. The game ends with General
March throwing out the last ball; he'll toss out the first next year.

The Tigers host the White Sox in a pair at Navin Field, winning both. Weaver
is 5 for 5 in game 1, a Sox loss, 11-5. In between games, ex-Tiger Davey
Jones visits with both teams. When Tiger manager Hugh Jennings suggests that
Bill Donovan start game 2 (Donovan last won a ML game in 1912), "Wild Bill"
agrees, but asks that Jones also play. As noted by historian Trent McCotter,
the game is played like an exhibition. The Tigers collect 21 hits off Eddie
Cicotte. Ty Cobb has 3 hits, including 2 bunt singles, then pitches the 6th
and 7th innings (2 walks, 3 hits) before giving way to outfielder Oscar
Veach, who finishes up. Hugh Jennings, who last played in 1912, finishes
up at 1B. Davey Jones' appearance here has been credited to Deacon Jones,
but it was Davey 0 for 2, who made the last putout in the 7-3 win.

The Reds end their season with a 6-3 and 1-0 sweep of the Cardinals. Cuban
rookie Dolf Luque, purchased in July, twirls the shutout.

1919
The National Commission recommends a best-of-9 World Series. The lengthier
WS is seen as a sign of greed and is abandoned after 3 years.

1920
William G. Harding, who will be elected as the next president of the United
States, throws three pitches for the Kerrigan Tailors, a semi-pro team,
in an exhibition game played against the Cubs. The contest, which the
Giants, Reds, and Indians declined to be participants, was arranged in the
presidential candidate's hometown to make him more appealing to the masses.

In Boston, the Red Sox top the Yankees, 6-2, in the opener of a 4-game
series. Ruth, still recovering from his swollen arm, coaches 1B. The Sox
have feasted off the top 3 contenders recently ... in the past 9 games,
Boston took 4 out of 5 from Cleveland, swept 3 from the White Sox, and top
the Yankees today.

1921
In Cincinnati, the Cubs' Pete Alexander outpitches his former teammate Eppa
Rixey to win, 7-0. Chicago is mired in 7th place.

1922
Behind Alex Ferguson and Bill Piercy, the Red Sox twice shutout the Senators,
winning 3-0 and 1-0.

Carl Mays wins his AL-record 23rd straight game over the Athletics,
although the Mackman knock him out of the box for the first time in his
win streak. He leaves with one out in the 6th and the Yankees winning,
7-2. New York prevails, 11-6, in game 1, but the A's win the nitecap, 4-0,
behind Hasty.

At Detroit, the Browns win their 2nd in a row over the Tigers, 5-4. Hub
Pruett allows 3 hits in 4 innings to win in relief. George Sisler hits in
his 30th consecutive game.

1923
After playing 238 games without being shutout, Kansas City is stopped by
Milwaukee's Nelson Potts, who wins 5-0. The string of scoring games ties
the AA record set by Minneapolis between September 1920 and June 1922.

1925
After losing game 1 by a 6-3 score to the Phils, the Giants unload in a
nitecap 24-9 shelling. The hits keep coming - 30 to be exact in a record 58
at-bats - at the Baker Bowl. Four New Yorkers - Southworth, Frisch, Irish
Meusel and Lindstrom - each collect 4 hits apiece, while a ML record-tying
ten batters each collect 2 hits each. Doc Farrell (2 for 3) who takes over
for Travis Jackson at short in the 6th is the 10th. Ex-Phil Meusel drives
home 9 runs, while Rookie Fred Fitzsimmons allows 14 hits, including homers
by Cy Williams, Johnny Mokan and Hal Carlson in the 8th frame. Phils starter
Art Decatur is the loser.

1926
In the first game of a twinbill between Chicago and St. Louis, Pete Alexander
exacts revenge on the Cubs, whipping them 2-0. Charlie Root is the loser. The
Cards take the nitecap, 9-1.

1927
The Cardinals bring Rabbit Maranville back from the minors, buying him from
Rochester (IL).

For the 2nd time this year, Ruth and Gehrig blast back-to-back homers in the
1st inning off the A's Rube Walberg, as the Yanks roll, 12-2. The duo has
connected in the same inning 5 times this year. Gehrig adds another in the
2nd off Rube for his 43rd of the year to leave him one behind Ruth. Trade
rumors fill the NY papers. Speculation has Gehrig going to Detroit or Bob
Meusel heading for Chicago in exchange for Willie Kamm and Bibb Falk. None
of the players change addresses.

At Pittsburgh, Ray Kremer outpitches Pete Alexander to give the Pirates a
5-2 win over the Cardinals. The Waners combine for 7 hits.

1928
The Senators top the Yankees, 2-0, as Fred Marberry does it all, shutting
down the Yanks and driving in both Nat runs. Bob Meusel's hit streak is
stopped at 6 straight, The New York lead is now 1 1/2 games over the A's,
winners of an exhibition game in Lycoming, PA.

1929
The Cubs beat the Cards twice, 11-7 and 12-10, before 81,000 fans at Wrigley
Field. A crowd of 38,000 fans sees the morning game and 43,000 watch the
afternoon game. Rogers Hornsby has 2 HRs and Hack Wilson has one. The Cubs
now lead the NL by 12 1/2 games, and will clinch in two weeks.

Thanks to "the greediness of a careless fan (NY World)," the Giants lose a
homerun when a fan interferes with a fly ball headed for the RF bleachers
at the Polo Grounds. Instead of a two-run homer by Edd Roush, the Giants
come up empty. Carl Hubbell goes all the way, only to lose to the Phils,
4-3 in 12 innings.

At Boston, the Senators and Red Sox split a pair, with the Nats taking the
opener, 10-7, behind Joe Judge and Joe Cronin. Boston takes the nitecap,
7-2, behind Milt Gaston's pitching and Bigelow's 4 hits. Judge has a 3-run
homer in game 1 and Cronin has 5 hits, including the cycle and 4 long hits,
collecting a single, 2 doubles, a triple and a homer.

1932
In St. Louis the Cubs' win streak reaches 13 as Cuyler's 5th homer in 6 games
leads the way to an 8-5 victory. Mark Koenig adds a round tripper for Chicago.

The Yankees keep their scoring streak alive by scoring in the bottom of
the 9th to beat the Senators, 1-0. Gehrig triples off Firpo Marberry to
score Ruth.

After winning game 1, 7-3, the A's shut out the Red Sox, 15-0, behind Lew
Krausse Sr A's SS Eric Mcnair has 3 homers today and Simmons a pair of 3-run
homers. Five days from now Krausse will injure his arm in an exhibition
game against the Stroudsburg Poconos and though only 20 years old, his big
league career is over. As historian Lyle Spatz notes, in 1961, Lew Krausse
Jr pitches a shutout for the KC A's in his major league debut, giving the
Krausses (father and son) back-to-back shutouts twenty-nine years apart.

1935
The first-place Cards open a 30-game home stand by sweeping a Labor Day
doubleheader from the Pirates. Paul Dean wins his 16th game, 4-3, in the
opener, then Dizzy cops his 23rd in the nitecap, 4-1. The Cards are two
games up on the rained-out Giants.

With the Cubs splitting two with the 7th-place Reds at Wrigley, Chicago is
just 2 1/2 in back of the Cards. Chicago wins, 3-1, in the opener as Lon
Warneke tops Tony Freitas, then lose, 4-2, to Gene Schott. Bill Lee takes
the loss.

Veteran P Dick Coffman (5-11) and Browns manager Hornsby get into a shoving
match shortly after their train leaves St. Louis for a road trip. Coffman
is cut from the team and put off the train at Edwardsville, IL, and will
not play again this year.

Boston pitcher Jack Wilson ends a slugfest with the Senators by hitting
an 11th-inning game ending homerun off Phil Hensiek to give the host Red
Sox a 9-8 victory in the first of 2. Joe Cronin helps the run total with
a grand slam. The Senators come back in the nitecap to also win by a run,
3-2. Wilson will hit his 2nd ML homer in 5 years.

1936
Johnny Allen holds the Yankees to 3 hits as the Indians beat New York, 4-3,
in 10 innings. Earl Averill hits a triple and scores in the 8th to tie it
up, then homers in the 10th to win.

George Tkach, a player for Superior (Northern League) dies from injuries
sustained when he was hit by a pitch in a game on August 27.

1937
For the second time this season, the first 2 batters in a game - the White Sox
Boze Berger and Mike Kreevich - hit HRs, victimizing Boston's Johnny Marcum
at Fenway. This is the 1st time 2 AL batters have opened with HRs. Chicago
takes a pair from Boston, winning 4-2 and 10-8.

1939
When Babe Dahlgren strikes out while being given an intentional walk and
George Selkirk and Joe Gordon try to steal home on successive pitches by
trotting to the plate, Red Sox fans throw a barrage of garbage onto the
playing field at Fenway Park to protest the Yankees making deliberate outs
to take advantage of the 6:30 Sunday curfew. Umpire Cal Hubbard rules the
Boston crowd's action makes it impossible to continue the game and awards
the game as a forefit to the Yankees with a 9-0 'official' score.

Nine players hit homers, as the Giants beat the Dodgers, 10-6, in the opener
of a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, falling one short of the record for
two teams in one game set in 1923. Brooklyn wins the 2nd game, 7-2.

1940
With the decision to play all their September games at Municipal Stadium,
the Indians promptly drop a Labor Day doubleheader to the 7th-place St. Louis
Browns. The Tribe loses, 2-1 and 3-0, and now lead the Yankees by 3 1/2
games. Vern Kennedy wins the opener, collecting 3 hits.

Washington's Sid Hudson beats the Red Sox' Lefty Grove, 1-0, in 13 innings.

Recent call-up Danny Litwhiler drives in 8 runs on 6 hits to lead the Phils
to a sweep of the Giants at Shibe Park. Kirby Higbe wins the opener, 11-2,
and Litwhiler has a grand slam. The Phils win the nitecap, 6-5, on Bobby
Bragan's 10th-inning HR.

1943
The Tigers take a pair from St. Louis, winning 5-4 and 8-5. Dizzy Trout racks
up his 16th win in game 1 and Hal Newhouser snaps a personal 9-game losing
streak by winning game 2, though he needs relief help in the 9th. After
driving in a run in each game, Rudy York is the first American Leaguer to
reach 100 RBIs this season.

1944
The Pirates nip the Cardinals' Ted Wilks, 5-4, to give him his first loss
after 11 straight victories. He is now 14-2.

Behind Dixie Walker's 4 for 4 cycle and Bordagaray's 4 hits, the Dodgers
beat the Giants, 8-4, and move out of last place. Curt Davis is the winner
over Bill Voiselle. Walker is now hitting .362.

1946
Red Sox pitcher Boo Ferriss wins his 12th straight game in the opener
and his 24th of the year as Boston sweeps two from the Yankees, 5-2 and
3-1. It is the Bosox' 10th straight win over New York this year and their
14th twinbill sweep. Boston split 13 doubleheaders on the year and lost
none. Dom DiMaggio and Nick Etten have HRs today. Ferriss, who earlier in
the season had a 10-game win streak, joins Walter Johnson (10 and 14 in 1913)
as the only pitchers with 2 winning streaks of 10 or more games in one season.

It's a first as manager Mel Ott lifts himself for a pinch hitter in the 7th
at Boston. Righty Sid Gordon goes in to pinch hit against lefty reliever
Ernie White and grounds out. Ott manages the Giants to an 8-3 win.

The Cardinals win a pair from the Reds, 6-4 and 8-7, as Al Brazle wins
both in relief. He toils 5 2/3 innings in the opener and another 3 in the
nitecap. It is the 2nd time in a month that a reliever has won a pair. Enos
Slaughter leads the attack with a 2-run homer in game 1 and 2 HRs, a double
and a single in game 2. St. Louis now leads the Dodgers by 2 1/2 games.

1948
Commissioner Happy Chandler fines the Pirates $2,000 for violating the NL
bonus rule. Pittsburgh signed M. L. Lynch as a scout while offering his son
Danny a $6,000-a-year contract. Chandler interprets this as an attempt to
influence the young second baseman's decision. Danny Lynch is declared a
free agent and signs with the Cubs.

1950
At Philadelphia, Mel Parnell registers his 9th straight win over the A's
as the Red Sox win, 9-3.

Phil Cavarretta leads off the 9th with a single, the Cubs' lone hit against
the Reds' Ewell Blackwell. The Whip strikes out 10 in winning, 5-1.

1951
Don Mueller hits 2 more HRs, giving him 5 in 2 days, to tie an ML mark. His
2nd homer, again off Phil Haugstad, comes a minute after he learns he is a
new father. Bobby Thomson adds his 25th homer and Jim Hearn beats the Dodgers,
11-2. After Mueller's 2nd homer, Haugstad decks Thomson and hits Mays with a
pitch, evoking a warning from Al Barlick. Barlick had earlier thumbed Branca
and Dick Williams in the 5th inning, Newcombe in the 6th when he objected
to a call, and Jackie Robinson and rookie Clem Labine. Dressen then clears
his bench to avoid any more thumbings. The Giants move to 5 games behind
Brooklyn. The Dodgers are suspicious of the losses at the Polo Grounds,
and later there are revelations about signs being flashed to Giant batters
from the CF scoreboard. Did it happen? Sal Yvars later said, "yes," while
Mueller remarked, "as for my homeruns and the sign stealing, this has been
much talked about and I would prefer not to comment." On the Dodgers' side,
Buzzie Bavasi denied it occurred, but Clyde Walker concluded, "it did happen."

Indians Harry Simpson, Al Rosen and Luke Easter hit consecutive HRs in the
first inning, as Cleveland beats the Browns, 5-1.

Ken Raffensberger fires a one-hitter at the Cubs to win, 7-0, and gain a
split for the Reds. The only hit is a 3rd-inning scratch single by Eddie
Miksis that arguably would have rolled foul. Bob Rush shuts out the Reds
in the nitecap to top Howie Fox, 3-0.

Tony Ponce of the Phoenix Senators (Southwest International League) hurls
his 38th consecutive complete game in beating Yuma, 4-2, for his 25th win
of the season.

1952
In his major league debut, Washington's Miguel Fornieles tosses a one-hitter
beating the visiting A's at Griffith Stadium, 5-0. The Senators' 20-year-old
rookie right-hander, who will be traded to the White Sox in the offseason
for Chuck Stobbs, finishes the season with a 2-2 record posting an ERA of
1.37 in four games.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, Washington's Mike Fornieles makes his
ML debut and pitches a one-hit 5-0 shutout against the A's. Joe Astroth's
2nd-inning single is the only hit off the young Cuban, just brought up from
Havana (Florida International L. class B). Washington takes the opener,
3-2 in 10 innings.

Yankee hurlers Tom Gorman and Ewell Blackwell shut out the Red Sox, 5-0
and 4-0, in a doubleheader.

1953
The Cardinals overcome a 3-run inside-the-park homer by SS Ted Kazanski to
beat the Phillies, 10-7. Rip Repulski hits his 20th HR, breaking the team's
rookie record set by John Mize in 1936. The Cards hammer 10 hits off Robin
Roberts to hand him his 12th loss.

1954
Dodger Russ Meyer beats the Cubs, 10-2, for his 16th consecutive win over
Chicago, dating back to 1950.

Mickey Vernon of the Senators gets his 2,000th hit. He also hits his 19th HR
(he will add one more before the end of the season) for a team record for
left-handers. Teammate Roy Sievers also sets a team record by hitting his
23rd HR. He will hit one more before the end of the season.

Before 39,494 at New York, the Yankees snap Bob Lemon's 11-game win streak
to beat the Indians, 3-2, in the rubber game of the series and move to 3
1/2 games from first place. Mantle's gigantic blast into the RF upper deck
in the 1st starts the Yankee scoring. Whitey Ford picks up his 16th win.

1955
After sitting out since August 7th with a broken rib, SS Alvin Dark of the
Giants falls and breaks his shoulder in a game against the Phillies. The
Phils win, 5-3, as Robin Roberts wins his 22nd.

Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle celebrate Billy Martin's return from the
army. Ford throws 6 innings of no-hit ball against Washington before Carlos
Paula spoils it in the 7th with Washington's only hit. The Yanks win, 4-2,
as Mantle hits his 36th HR, a 3-run shot off Bob Porterfield. Mantle is
10 HRs ahead of rivals Al Kaline and Ted Williams. New York stays a half
game behind the White Sox, winners over the 3rd-place Indians. Billy Martin
will hit .300 in September, and New York will go on a 17-6 tear to win the
pennant by 3 games.

Ernie Banks belts his 40th homer to set a new ML record for shortstops. The
previous record of 39 was held by Vern Stephens. Teammates Randy Jackson and
Walker Cooper also homer to help Paul Minner win, 12-2, over the Cards. Wally
Moon homers for St. Louis and Tom Poholsky is the losing pitcher. 'Mr. Cub'
will finish this season with 44 homers and will hit 48 in 1958 to extend
the record.

1957
At Wrigley Field, the Braves sweep the Cubs, 23-10 and 4-0, collecting a
franchise record 26 hits in the opening win. The 23 runs is also a franchise
mark, as is the 33 runs for 2 clubs. Milwaukee takes the 2nd game, 4-0,
behind Bob Trowbridge's 3-hitter. The Braves' Bob Hazle, who started the
game at .500 (35 for 70) is 4 for 7 in the first game, and teammate Frank
Torre scores 6 runs to tie the ML record. The Braves score 13 in the 1st 3
frames but starter Burdette gets knocked out and the win goes to Johnson. Rush
appears in game 2 after losing the opener with 1/3 inning of work.

1958
At Yankee Stadium, New York snaps a scoreless tie with Boston when Berra
and Mantle crash back-to-back 6th-inning homers off Dave Sisler. Mantle has
hit three this year off Sisler. New York wins, 6-1. Mantle, with 38 homers,
leads the AL. Mantle and Berra will hit back-to-back homers 12 times together,
and homer in the same game 50 times before they are through.

Minneapolis approves a $9 million bond issue to expand Metropolitan Stadium
to 41,000 seats. City alderman Byron Nelson predicts it is a "dead cinch"
that Washington will move there.

1959
Jackie Brandt crashes a homer in the 9th inning against the Cubs to give
the first place Giants a 4-3 win. The Cubs score 2 in the 9th, off Mike
McCormick, to tie. The Giants had lost 5 of 6 before today.

The Dodgers spot the Cardinals a 4-run lead before roaring back for a 9-6
win. Chuck Churn, the last of 4 pitchers, is the winner, as the Dodgers
remain 1 1/2 games in back of the Giants. Ken Boyer's single off Churn
extends his hitting streak to 21 games.

The White Sox jar the Tigers twice, 7-2 and 11-4, to extend their AL lead to
5 1/2 games. Dick Donovan tosses a 4-hitter in the opener, and Sherm Lollar
provides a pair of 2-run doubles. The Sox tuck away the nitecap with an
11-run 5th inning. Foytack gives up a lead-off homer in the 5th to Al Smith,
retires the next 2 batters, and then Aparicio lines the first of 8 singles in
the frame. The Sox tally an AL-record 10 runs after there are 2 outs and the
bases empty. Reliever Joe Stanka, just up from the minors, is the beneficiary.

The Reds dim the Bucs' pennant hopes with a 6-3 and 2-1 sweep. Willie Jones'
3-run homer in the opener, off Elroy Face, gives the win to rookie Jim
O'Toole. The loss goes to Vern Law, who put 2 on before leaving (just before
Jones' homer). Pinson and Robinson also homer. Johnny Temple's 2-out triple
and Vada Pinson's 44th double in the 8th win the nitecap for Don Newcombe.

1960
In the first game of a doubleheader, Ted Williams homers off Don Lee of
the Senators. Williams had homered against Lee's father, Thornton, 20 years
earlier. Boston sweeps, winning the first, 4-1, and the 2nd game, 3-2.

Milt Pappas stops New York on 3 hits - 2 by Kubek - to give Baltimore a 5-0
win in the first of a 3-game showdown. The Orioles now trail New York by .003.

1961
Against Detroit's Frank Lary, Maris doubles and takes 3B on a misplay. Mantle,
hurting from a pulled muscle in his forearm, lays down a perfect drag bunt
to score Roger. Maris then blasts homers his next two trips to the plate,
and Elston Howard adds a three-run homer, for a 7-2 win.

Milwaukee manager Chuck Dressen (71-58) is axed and executive vice president
Birdie Tebbetts becomes the new skipper.

1962
Stan Musial's 3,516th hit jumps him over Tris Speaker and into 2nd place
behind Ty Cobb, but the Mets beat the Cards, 4-3. Although The Man will
continue on to 3,630 hits, he cannot overtake Cobb and, in time, Pete Rose
and Hank Aaron will surpass him as well.

1963
With the Senators ahead, 5-3, on 4th-inning homers by Don Zimmer and Ed
Brinkman, Nats starter Ed Hobaugh hits his only career homerun in the same
frame off Cleveland's Jerry Walker. The Tribe knocks out Hobaugh but the
Senators hold on to win, 8-7. Hobaugh's homer comes on his last official
at-bat ... in his one additional plate appearance, he draws a walk. Hobaugh
joins Buster Narum this year as the first pitchers to have more homers than
wins in a year. It'll be matched this century by Dave Eiland in 1992.

In game 2 of a twinbill at the Polo Grounds, Pete Rose hits the first pitch
of the game from Jay Hook for a leadoff homer. It's the only score as the

During a pregame ceremony at Shea Stadium, the Mets retire Casey Stengel's

the expansion team, never finishing higher than last place.

The Cubs beat St. Louis, 5-3, at Wrigley Field, as Ernie Banks hits his 400th
homerun, a three-run shot off Curt Simmons, in the 3rd. Simmons teed up the
400th HR of Willie Mays in 1963. Banks will end the season with 28 HRs and
106 RBIs. Ron Santo and Billy Williams will also knock in over 100 runs,
the only team with 3 such sluggers, but the Cubs will finish 8th.

win the opener, 6-4, scoring 2 unearned runs in the 8th.

In the first six innings, Rangers starter Sam McDowell walks 6 Nats batters,
5 intentionally. Three of the intentional passes go to Frank Howard in
his first 3 at-bats, twice when he leads off the inning. McDowell moves
to 1B in the 6th inning, with 2 on and no outs, and Dean Chance comes in
allowing both runners to score. McDowell comes back to the mound to finish,
losing 4-1 to Dick Bosman.

That old black magic works for Gary Nolan as he outpitches Juan Marichal
to beat the Giants, 2-0. Before the game Reds teammate Angel Bravo gives
Nolan a rubber ball to carry during the game, assuring him that he'll pitch
a low-hit game as a result. Nolan allows 3 hits.

1971
Cesar Cedeno bloops an inside-the-park grand slam as a result of second
baseman Jim Lefebvre and right fielder Bill Buckner colliding trying to
make the fifth-inning catch. The dropped 200-foot fly ball enables the

pitches his 5th shutout of the season.

1972
Coming to bat in the top of the 8th inning trailing, 8-0, the Mets score
seven runs and add another four tallies in the ninth to stun the Astros,
11-8. It's the Amazins' biggest come-from-behind victory in franchise history.

With his 2,971st hit in a Pirates uniform, Roberto Clemente breaks Honus

Three Rivers Stadium.

In his major league debut, Doug Rau throws a three-hitter beating St. Louis

Dodger southpaw helps his cause with a RBI-triple in the second inning.

Milt Pappas of the Cubs hurls a no-hit game in beating the Padres, 8-0. Pappas
has a perfect game until PH Larry Stahl walks with 2 outs in the 9th inning
on a 3-2 pitch. Pappas and C Randy Hundley both said of the pitches to Stahl,
"They were so close I don't know how Stahl could take them, but they were
balls." Pappas later commented on the plate umpire Bruce Froemming, "He had a
chance to become famous as the umpire in the twelfth perfect game in baseball
history, but he blew it" [Froemming will later call Dennis Martinez' perfect
game in 1991.] Pappas retires former Cub Garry Jestadt to finish the game.

A controversial call against the Reds helps the Astros win, 4-3. Johnny
Bench's single in the 7th scores one run and the 2nd base runner Joe Morgan

safe. The Cincinnati City Council will pass a resolution stating their
shock and dismay at the "atrocious call."

1975
Johnny LeMaster homers in his first ML at-bat for the Giants during a
7-3 win over Dodgers. In 12 years and 3,191 at-bats, LeMaster will hit

homer. Brian Downing two years ago was the first player to hit his first
homer inside-the-park.

1983
Mike Flanagan of the Orioles wins his 13th straight over the Twins, but it

with Frank Viola and gives the Orioles a 1-0 win. The streak goes back to
August 5‚ 1978.

1985

September 3, Greg Maddux makes his ML debut, one of his four relief
appearances. Tied 3-3 after 8, Houston scored once in the top of the ninth,
and then Chicago answered with their own run, pushing the two into extra
innings. After seven shutout innings from each bullpen, the two sides trade
3 run salvos in the 17th to push the game into the 18th. Entering the game
as a pinch runner, Maddux appears on the mound in the top of the 18th,
surrendering a one-out homerun to Billy Hatcher that proves to be the game
winner, 9-8. The two teams use a major league record 53 players in the game.

1987
The parent Phillies don't find Bresnahan's potato gag yesterday funny
either, and release him. Bresnahan, hitting .149, explains, "We were 27
games out, what the hell?" Tomorrow night, their last game of the season,
the Williamsport Bills will admit any fan for a $1 and a potato. On each
potato, Bresnahan autographs, "this spuds for you."

Tom Candiotti pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season, but also walks 7
batters and makes an error as the Indians lose to Detroit, 2-1. Matt Nokes'

by 9th-inning hits. Steib had previously thrown 5 one-hitters. He K's 9 in
beating Bud Black.

1991
Three months after an operation that replaced a vein in his arm with
one from his leg, White Sox pitcher Roberto Hernandez holds the Royals
hitless for 6 innings before Bill Pecota leads off the 7th with a double,
the only hit Hernandez allows in Chicago's 5-1 win over KC. In the same
game, Bo Jackson makes his miraculous return to the majors following a
career-threatening football injury. He hits a sacrifice fly to drive in a
run against his former team. Bo will end the year hitting .225 in 23 games,
with 3 homers and 14 RBIs.

total score.

In his first game back in action since undergoing surgery for an aneurysm
in his pitching shoulder in May, Yankees' P David Cone hurls 7 hitless
innings in New York's 5-0 victory over the Athletics at Oakland-Alameda
County Coliseum. Mariano Rivera gives up 1 hit in 2 innings as he finishes
up for Cone. Cone's remarkable return sends Kenny Rogers to the bullpen.

It's seems like old timers day as the Cardinals whip the Central-leading
Astros, 8-7. Willie McGee, playing for Ron Gant, has 4 hits and 3 RBIs,
while Ozzie Smith has 3 hits, 3 RBIs and 4 runs.

1997
Trailing 12-7, the Rangers score 6 runs in the bottom of the 9th to pull

Fulmer, off Bret Saberhagen, comes in his first ML at-bat.

1998
Slammin' Sammy Sosa hits his 56th homer to tie Hack Wilson's 68-year-old

off Jason Bere contributes to the Cubs' 4-2 victory over Cincinnati.

over the Mariners. Boston's slugging shortstop joins Mark McGwire as one
of only five players to hit 30 homers in each of his first two seasons.

Kent Mercker hits a grand slam, and also picks up the win in the Redbirds'
14-4 rout of the Marlins at Dolphin Stadium. It will be the only career
homerun hit by the Cardinals' left-hander in his 18-year tenure in the
major leagues.

At Pro Player Stadium, Mark McGwire hits 2 HRs against the Marlins for the
2nd consecutive day to set a new major league mark for homers in a season by
a righthanded batter with 59. The Cardinals defeat the Marlins by a score
of 14-4. The previous record was held by Jimmie Foxx with 58 in 1932 and
Hank Greenberg who also hit 58 six years later.

1999
Setting off a very enthusiastic ovation at Camden Yards, Cal Ripken Jr becomes
the 29th major leaguer to hit 400 career homeruns. The Oriole third baseman
connects off Devil Ray right-hander Rolando Arrojo. The Orioles defeat the
Devil Rays, 11-6.

Well drilling in Toronto. Starter David Wells of the Blue Jays is opposed
by Bob Wells of the Minnesota Twins who strikes out Jays rookie Vernon
Wells. Toronto wins, 6-1.

2000
Elvis Pena becomes the first person named Elvis to appear in a major league
game. The 23-year-old Dominican infielder, in his debut for the Rockies,
strikes out swinging as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning in Colorado's
8-3 loss to Milwaukee at Coors Field.

The White Sox defeat the Angels, 13-6, as C Charles Johnson drives home 7
runs on a 3-run homer, a 3-run double and an RBI single.

2001
The Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 1-0, as P Mike Mussina comes within a strike
of hurling a perfect game. PH Carl Everett's two-out two-strike single in
the 9th inning ruins Mussina's gem. It is the 3rd time in his career that
the righty has taken a perfect game into the 8th inning, and his 4th career
1-hitter. The Yankees score the only run of the contest in the top of the 9th
on Enrique Wilson's double. Opposing hurler David Cone, who takes the loss,
is the most recent hurler to toss a perfecto. The Yankees' sweep of the Red
Sox was the first in baseball history by a team that did not score in the
first 7 inning of any of the games. In a move that enrages many players,
Red Sox GM Dan Duquette abruptly relieves pitching coach John Cumberland
of his duties just minutes after the game. A visibly angry Cumberland,
who was promoted from bullpen coach to pitching coach last month when Joe
Kerrigan became manager, said Duquette told him he was being reassigned to
the team's training facility in Fort Myers, Fla. "I'm not going," Cumberland
said. "That's official, that's for damn sure. That's OK. We've had a lot
of good people leave this organization, and now it's going to be me because
I'm not going to be reassigned."

The White Sox outslug the Blue Jays to win, 19-10, on 17 hits. Karim Garcia

for the Sox. Chris Singleton has 4 hits including a homer, and Jose Conseco
connects as well.

Ryan Klesko hits a game ending HR in the 13th inning to give the Dodgers a
1-0 win over the D'Backs. The loser is Byung-Hyun Kim. It is the 2nd time
that Kim has ended a 1-0 game with a homer to the only batter he faces.

In the first game of a DH, New Haven pitcher Jimmy Journall makes his
1st Eastern League start a memorable one, tossing a no-hitter to beat
Bowie. Journall, co-pitcher of the year in the Carolina League, finishes
the year with a 12-game win streak.

In an 11-7 loss to Columbus, Toledo gives up 3 runs on a unusual 4-base error
(as noted by John Lewis). With runners on 1st & 2nd, catcher Dave Lindstrom
pounces on a sacrifice bunt, starts to throw to third, then stops and rushes
a too-high throw to first. The ball goes through the Toledo bullpen area to
the fence about 60 feet from the fair pole allowing Kary Bridges to easily
circle the bases.

2002
The A's defeat the Royals, 7-6, for their 19th straight victory to match
the longest winning streak in AL history. The 1906 White Sox and the 1947
Yankees both reached 19.

The Dodgers pummel the Diamondbacks, 19-1, with only a 9th-inning score
preventing them from tying the team mark for most lopsided shutout ever. The
24 hits ties the mark for the team in Los Angeles. They score 8 of their
runs in the 7th inning, with Beltre and Kinkade homering in the frame. The
last hit for LA is the first ML homer by Dave Ross, and it comes off Mark
Grace, who pitches the 9th inning.

The Cubs beat the Brewers, 17-4, to salvage a split in their doubleheader
after Milwaukee takes the opener by a score of 4-2 on solo homers by Ron
Belliard (2), Eric Young and Jose Hernandez. Glendon Rusch wins his 8th
straight over the Cubs. Chicago P Kerry Wood ties a ML record in the second
game by fanning four Brewers in the 4th inning. Wood also homers off Andrew
Lorraine, one of 5 gophers he serves up. Another is Sammy Sosa's 494th homer,
moving him ahead of Lou Gehrig on the all-time list.

Braden Looper (1-5) in his 66th relief appearance of the year, extends
the Mets home losing streak to 15 in the 12-inning first game of a
doubleheader. Florida wins, 3-2. Preston Wilson ties the game in the 9th
with a HR, and Juan Encarnacion wins it with an RBI double. The Mets take
the nightcap, 11-5, overcoming back-to-back homeruns in the 2nd by Derrek
Lee and Mike Lowell. Mike Piazza drills a pinch 3-run HR. The win snaps the
Mets' home loss streak at 15 games, a NL record set by the 1911 Braves. They
last won at home on July 31.

Jon Rauch (1-1), the tallest pitcher in major league history lowers his
career ERA from 9.82 to 9.72 with 2 ER in 2 IP in his first appearance
since May 2. The White Sox win, 5-4, as Jose Valentin hits a pair of homers,
the 2nd snapping a tie.

Pittsburgh's Salomon Torres (1-0), pitching in the majors for the first
time since July 20, 1997, starts and goes 8 1/3 scoreless innings against
the Braves. He also collects his first hit since 1994 as the Pirates
win, 3-0. Torres, 30, retired as an active player in 1997 and served as
Montreal's pitching coach in the Dominican Summer League before signing
with Pittsburgh in January. Fortunately for the Braves, only 18,931 fans,
the smallest crowd in Turner Field history, see the game.

2003
In an effort to make the perception of the team younger and hipper, the Blue
Jays unveiled their fourth logo in the franchise's 27-year history. The new
look for the 2004 season adds black and silver trimming to a newly stylized
bird while eliminating the red maple leaf backdrop and the word Blue.

The Dodgers down the Astros, 4-1, as Eric Gagne sets a ML record with
his 55th consecutive save. The old mark was held by Tom Gordon of the Red
Sox. This season Gagne has 44 saves with no blown saves, another ML mark.

Sammy Sosa hits a 2-run walkoff homer (his career 9th) in the 15th inning
to give the Cubs a 4-2 win over the Cardinals. It is the opener of a
doubleheader.

2004
The Giants acquire P Dave Burba from the Brewers for minor league P Josh
Habel.

The Yankees score 1 in the 1st and five in the 2nd off Indian starter Cliff
Lee enroute to a 9-1 win. A-Rod homers and Gary Sheffield has 3 hits and 3
RBIs to reach the 100-RBI mark. He joins 19th century star Dan Brouthers who
drove in 100 RBIs for 5 different teams between 1887 and 1894. Sheffield also
drove in 100 for the Padres, Marlins, Dodgers and Braves. Joining him today
with 100 RBIs is Victor Martinez who hits a solo homer off Steve Karsay,
who is making his first appearance since 2003.

2006
At Tropicana Field, the Devil Rays' second triple play in franchise history is
the first ever in the annuals of the game in which the ball never touched the
bat. The 2-6-2 triple killing (a first) occurs when Raul Ibanez strikes out
on a 3-2 pitch, then Adrian Beltre is thrown out attempting to steal second
by catcher Dioner Navarro, with shortstop Ben Zobrist returning the ball to
the plate to nail Jose Lopez trying to score from third. The Mariners shrug
off the first inning triple play and end a 12-game road losing streak, beating
the Devil Rays, 4-3. Cha Seung Baek (2-0) allows one run in 6 2/3 innings.

Joining Jeremy Hermida (Marlins, 2005) and Bill Duggleby (Phillies, 1898),
Kevin Kouzmanoff becomes the third player in major league history to hit a
grand slam in his first career at-bat. The Indians' 25-year-old DH, filling
in for the injured Travis Hafter - who hit six bases-juiced homers this
season tying a major league record - is the first person to accomplish the
feat on the first pitch he ever sees in the big leagues.

The Pirates extend their franchise-record consecutive losing season streak
to 14 as the club drops their 82nd game of the season to Chris Carpenter
and the Cardinals, 3-1. The 1933-1948 Phillies own the big league record
finishing with a losing record for 16 straight seasons.

2008
New York starter Jonathon Niese, who was born on the day the Mets won their
last World Championship, makes his major league debut against the Brewers
in Miller Park. On his second pitch of the game, the 21-year-old southpaw
gives up a homerun to Rickie Weeks making the him only rookie in franchise
history to yield a homerun to the first batter he faces in his career.

2009
Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees collects his 2,500th hit with a
single in the fifth inning against the Baltimore Orioles. He becomes the
89th player in MLB history to reach this mark.
