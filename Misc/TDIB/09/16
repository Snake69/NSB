Emil Batch. McGinnity wins the nitecap, 5-3.

1905
The Highlanders find themselves a little short on infielders so RF
Willie Keeler, who is lefthanded, plays 2B in both games against visiting
Washington. The talented Keeler played two games at shortstop for New York
in 1893. New York splits, winning 5-2 and losing 3-0.

the White Stockings to a 12-2 win over the St. Louis Browns. He's the 2nd
Chicago player to swipe 4 bases in a game this year ... George Davis did
it on June 14.

1906
Against the Pirates, the Cubs win their final home game, 5-1, ending the
match with a muff. A 2-out grounder to Joe Tinker looks like the final out as
he throws to Chance and the crowd surges to the field. But Chance drops the
ball, grabs it late for the out, but sprints for the clubhouse with his team
and fans following. Ump Conway throws up his hands and calls the game over.

1907
In a doubleheader sweep, 3-1 and 3-2, of the Giants, Boston slugger Dave Brain
hits his 10th homer, off the Giants' Red Ames. Brain's ten round trippers
will lead the NL this year, but he will never hit another. The same fate
befell Fred Odwell two years ago. Brain will be sold to the Reds in May,
the same route that will be taken by the 1910 NL homer champion, Fred Beck.

1909

in a 0-0 tie.

1911
Boston's Smoky Joe Wood and rookie Buck O'Brien toss back-to-back shutouts to

who relieved in his last appearance, will finish all of his five starts
going 5-1.

1913
In the first-place A's 8-7 win over Cleveland, LF Rube Oldring pulls off

record for the 6th-place club.

1915
In the first of an important four-game series at Fenway Park, the Tigers
(90-48) and Red Sox (90-44) square off. Detroit knocks out starter Rube
Foster, then rookie reliever Carl Mays keeps throwing at Ty Cobb till he hits
the Tiger star on the wrist. Cobb slings his bat at Mays in retaliation,
and the crowd reacts by throwing bottles at Cobb. The next inning, Cobb
catches a fly ball for the final out and then needs a police escort to
leave the field. The Tigers win, 6-1.

1916
The Reds' Fred Toney pitches 12 innings in the nitecap against Brooklyn
before the game is called at 1-1. Zack Wheat goes hitless to end his hit
streak at 29 consecutive games. He'll put together a streak of 26 in 1919.

At the Baker Bowl, Pete Alexander is coasting with a 2 hit 6-0 lead in the
8th over the Cubs, when weak-hitting Steve Yerkes lines a single followed by
manager Joe Tinker's only hit of the year. On a DP grounder, 1B Fred Luderus
pulls his foot off the bag and Chicago goes on to score 3 runs. Second-place
Philadelphia wins, 6-3, to pull within 1 1/2 games of Brooklyn.

Chicago's Dickie Kerr tops the Yankees, 8-3, the loss dropping New York to
2nd place behind Cleveland.

1922
After listening to excessive bench jockeying from the Giants' dugout, Reds
hurler Adolfo Luque becomes so enraged he throws down his glove and bolts
into the New York dugout. The Cuban native, known for his fiery temper,
punches Casey Stengel on the jaw and is ordered to return to his own bench
by the police, who are busy trying to prevent the Polo Grounds crowd,
which has overflowed onto the field, from rioting.

Pennant fever rages in St. Louis as the Yankees come to town with a half-game
lead. Bob Shawkey outpitches Urban Shocker, 2-1, as Sisler ties Cobb's 1911
record by hitting in his 40th straight game. While chasing a fly ball in the
9th, New York OF Whitey Witt is hit in the head and knocked cold by a soda
bottle thrown from the bleachers. Ban Johnson will initially offer a $1,000
reward for the name of the bottle-thrower. Then, to calm the crowds, the
AL offers the theory that Witt stepped on the bottle and it flew up and hit
him. The incident leads to a ban on the sale of bottled drinks in ballparks.

1923
The Cubs lose, 10-6, to the Giants in Chicago despite the hitting of Hack
Miller who collects 3 doubles and a triple. A riot occurs in the 8th inning
when umpire Charlie Moran makes an out call at 2B on Sparky Adams. Moran is
pelted by hundreds of pop bottles. Judge Landis, in attendance at the game,
shakes his cane at the angry mob, and play is held up for 15 minutes. John
McGraw and the umpires need a police escort at the conclusion.

1924
At Ebbets Field, Cards 1B Jim Bottomley's 3 singles, a double and 2 HRs
(6 for 6) produce a ML-record 12 RBIs in the St. Louis 17-3 win over the
pennant-chasing Robins. Willie Sherdel coasts home for the win. Bottomley
starts the rampage with a 2-run single in the 1st, doubles home a run
in the 2nd, hits a 4th-inning grand slam off Art Decatur, and a 2-run HR
off Decatur in the 6th. He follows with a 2-run single in the 7th, off Tex
Wilson, and a run-scoring single in the 9th, after which he's removed for a
pinch runner. Brooklyn manager Wilbert Robinson, watching from the dugout,
set the previous record with the Orioles in 1892.

1925
In the first of two games, Cubs veteran Grover Alexander wins, 3-0, over
Boston. Boston comes back to take game 2, 8-6.

John Bates of Nashville (Southern) goes hitless ending his 46-game hitting
streak. He hit .371 during the streak.

1926
Enroute to a 23-3 rout of the Phillies at the Baker Bowl, the Cardinals cross
home plate 12 times during the third inning. The dozen runs establishes a
franchise record for the Redbirds.

The Giants clean house early, giving Heinie Groh his release and allowing
Irish Meusel to buy out his. Irish will finish out his career with a season
in Brooklyn.

At Philadelphia, the Cards sweep a pair from the Phils to tie for first place
with the Reds. They open with a 23-3 pasting, a game in which 36 players
are used, 22 by the Phils. The Cards plate 12 runs in the 3rd inning, with
all the Cardinals getting a hit except Billy Southworth, who is robbed of
a double by Freddy Leach's catch. Taylor Douthit has a walk and a single,
2 stolen bases, and 5 runs scored in the game. Flint Rhem is the winning
pitcher. The game is enlivened in the 6th when Bill Klem thumbs C Wilson
and manager Art Fletcher out of the game. Moments later a sign "Catfish
Klem" appears in the clubhouse window and Klem holds up the game until it
is removed. The Cards lighten up in game 2, winning 10-2, behind Art Reinhart.

1927
Despite the A's 6th win in a row - a 6-3 decision over the Browns - A's owner
Connie Mack has a loud-mouthed fan arrested for jeering. Mack contends that
the vocal roarings of Harry Donnelly caused the thin-skinned Billy Lamar
to be released, and injured the nervous systems of Sammy Hale and OF Zack
Wheat. Mack contends that the fans' yelling caused several fielding errors
to be made. Donnelly is held for disturbing the peace. Ty Cobb has three
singles and a steal in the game and now has 13 hits in his last 18 at-bats.

1930
At Ebbets Field, the Cards (82-60) and Dodgers (84-60) square off before
30,000. Cards P Bill Hallahan retires the first 20 batters, before he
fumbles a grounder. A single in the 8th spoils his no-hitter. The Cards
finally score in the 10th on a single by Taylor Douthit after Andy High
hits a pinch double and hold on for a dramatic 1-0 win over starter Dazzy
Vance. (As a leadoff batter, Douthit will knock in a record 84 runs, a mark
that Dom DiMaggio will tie in 1948.) The victory gives the Cards 1st place
by a percentage point over the Brooklyn, losers for the first time in 12
games, their longest win streak in franchise history. The Cubs are in 3rd,
just 1 1/2 out.

At the Polo Grounds, Carl Hubbell sets the 3rd-place Cubs back, winning 7-0,
while striking out 10.

The Phils score 5 runs in the 9th inning to tie the Pirates, 10-10, The
Bucs score 4 runs in the top of the 10th, then the Phils plate another 5
to win, 15-14. The Phils use a triple play in the 8th inning to keep the
Bucs from scoring.

1931
The St. Louis Cardinals beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6-3, behind Bill
Hallahan's 18th win of the year, and prepare for a rematch of the 1930 World
Series. Earlier in the day, the Cincinnati Reds clinched it for the Birds
by sweeping the New York Giants, 7-3 and 4-3. The Cards' victory completes
a six-game sweep of the Phillies, who have gone 5-51 at St. Louis since
1927, a winning percentage of .089, the lowest in history for a club with
at least that many visiting games against a team.

Led by Earl Webb, who hits his 62nd and 63rd doubles of the year, the Red
Sox edge the visiting White Sox, 2-1, and bound out of the AL cellar.

1933
The Giants win two over the 2nd place Cubs, winning the first one, 2-1,
behind Hubbell's 22nd win. New York takes the nitecap, 6-3.

steal in the 7th inning. The second game is called in the 5th with Brooklyn
ahead, 4-2.

1934
The largest turnout in Polo Grounds history, 62,573, suffers as the Deans
take two from the Giants. Diz needs relief from Tex Carleton for a 5-3
opener, but Paul goes 11 innings for a 3-1 win over Carl Hubbell, his 6th
victory over the Giants this year. Pepper Martin homers off King Carl. The
Cardinals leave New York 3 1/2 games behind the league-leading Giants.

Los Angeles (PCL) sweeps a pair from Oakland, 10-1, and 9-0. In the first
game, Jigger Statz of Los Angeles ties a league record with 6 steals,
swiping 2nd base in the first inning, 3rd base in the 3rd inning and both
bases in the 7th and 9th innings. The 37-year-old Statz will finish the
season with 61 steals.

1935
In the opener of a critical 4-game series in Chicago, the Giants lose, 8-3,
to the Cubs' Lon Warneke. The Cubs have now won 12 straight.

Brown versus Brown as Pittsburgh reliever Mace Brown pitches 5 innings of
shutout relief to beat Boston, 5-3. Wally Berger's 3rd double of the game
in the 9th is the only hit he allows. The Bucs' Gus Suhr plays 1B in the
last inning to run his streak of consecutive games played to 619, a new NL
record. The old mark was set by Eddie Brown from 1924 to 1928.

1936
The Cubs sweep a pair from the lowly Bees, winning 3-2 and 4-2. Tex Carleton,
working on 2 days rest, beats Boston in the opener for the 8th time this

Melton wins his 17th, allowing just 6 safeties.

At Wrigley, Boston stops the stumbling Cubs, 7-0, behind veteran rookie
Jim Turner's 18th win. The Bees win the series, 3-1. Starter Bill Lee,
who goes two innings, is the loser.

Cleveland. Gomez has now won 19 games, while the Yankees increase their
lead to 10 1/2 games over Detroit.

Future Hall of Famer Martin Dihigo pitches the first professional no-hit
no-run game on Mexican soil, a 4-0 victory against Nogales at Veracruz. In
1938, Dihigo will lead the Mexican League in 4 categories:  ERA (0.90),
wins (18-2), strikeouts (184) and batting (.387).

At Boston, Gimbel's baseball team will play Filene's, winner of Boston's
Retail Store League. Gimbel's, of the New York Department Store League,
is led by future major-leaguer Sid Gordon.

1938
Johnny Rizzo becomes the first Pirate player in franchise history to hit
20 homeruns in a season. The 25-year-old rookie outfielder from Texas,
who becomes hurt next season never playing regularly for the Bucs again,
finishes the campaign batting .301 with 23 round-trippers and 111 RBIs.

1939
The New York Yankees clinch their 4th successive pennant with a 10-3 win
over Detroit.

1940
Rookie Johnny Lucadello of the St. Louis Browns hits HRs from each side of the
plate versus the New York Yankees in a 16-4 Browns win. Only Wally Schang,
in 1916, had accomplished the same in the AL. Mickey Mantle in 1955 will be
the next AL player to do it. Today's clouts are the only HRs Lucadello will
hit all year, and he will hit just three more homeruns during his six-year
career. The Browns sweep by winning the nitecap, dropping the Yankees to
3 1/2 back of the Indians.

The Indians split a doubleheader with the last-place A's, winning 8-3
and losing 3-2, while the Tigers move to a half-game back by beating the
Senators, 9-2. Bobo Newsom cops his 19th win.

After the Dodgers lose to the Reds, 4-3 in ten innings, a rhubarb at Ebbets
Field results in a suspension and fine for Leo Durocher for "inciting a
riot." Perhaps better known from the game is the photo showing an obese
Brooklyn fan astride George Magerkurth, pummeling the veteran umpire.

Called up from the Eastern League in August, Phillies rookie Danny Litwhiler
singles in both games of 7-1 and 3-2 losses to St. Louis, extending his
hitting streak to 21 straight games. He will be stopped tomorrow by Whitey
Moore at Cincinnati, but will hit .345 in 36 games.

1941
NL Prexy Ford Frick warns the Reds and Dodgers that any repeat of the slowdown
of yesterday will result in fines. The two teams play normally and the Reds
come away with a 4-3 11-inning win over the league leaders. Werber drives
in all the Reds runs.

The Cardinals-Giants game ends in a 1-1 tie called on account of darkness.

A's rookie Elmer Valo hits his first homer, off Johnny Niggeling of the
Browns. The Czech-born Valo, who hit .348 in six games last year, will
improve to .420 in 50 at-bats this September to earn a starting job for 1942.

1942
Bowing to the Cubs in the nightcap of a twin bill, 4-1, the Phillies become

1938 to the end of this season, the team will compile a 227-532 (.299)
record under three different managers.

Ben Chapman, pitcher/manager for Richmond (Piedmont League) punches out

losers to the A's. Ray Schalk's single in the 4th is the only hit.

1945
After 10 straight losses to Newhouser stretching back to 1943, the Senators
finally beat the Detroit ace, 3-2. behind Roger Wolff's 19th win. The Tigers
then win the nitecap, 5-4, to stay 2 1/2 ahead.

At New York, the Browns and Yankees split a pair, the Bombers losing the
opener, 6-2, to Bob Muncrief. Vern Stephens has a 3-run homer and drives
in 4 runs. Leadoff hitter Pete Gray is 1 for 4, collecting his safety off
reliever Tiny Bonham. It is the last major league hit for the one-armed
outfielder as he goes 0 for 3 in the nitecap, a 5-4 win for New York. Spud
Chandler, the winning pitcher, drives in 3 runs.

1948
Larry Doby's first-inning grand slam proves to be the difference as the
Indians hand the Senators their 16th consecutive defeat, 6-3. The bases
full homer extends the rookie outfielder's hitting streak to 21 games.

becoming just the 8th player to hit 300. It's New York's only score as they
lose, 2-1. The Yankees take the nitecap, 8-4, with Joe Page the winner
in relief. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby,
Chuck Klein and Hank Greenberg are the only other major leaguers to have
300 career HRs.

At St. Louis, Cliff Fannin allows 4 Boston hits through 8 innings and hangs
on to beat the leading Red Sox and Mel Parnell, 3-1.

homer, and beat the visiting Reds, 12-6. Marv Rackley has 4 singles and
Jackie Robinson and Carl Furillo combine for 7 RBIs.

bonus baby.

1949

Tebbett's starts for 2nd drawing the throw. Lou Stringer, the baserunner on
3rd, then scores. Stringer has 4 hits, 3 RBIs and 3 runs scored as the Red
Sox roll, 12-4. Mel Parnell is the easy winner at Fenway. With the Yanks
beating the Tigers, Boston remains 2 1/2 games in back.

1950

in Detroit, 8-1, and move them back into first place. DiMaggio hits his

win without a loss. The Red Sox will follow the Yankees into Detroit and
sweep three from the Tigers.

member of the Cubs.

ace stops the Reds, 9-5.

Joe Gordon, former All-Star 2B for the Yankees and Indians and now manager

1953
A special American League committee studying the Browns' financial status
recommends the franchise be transferred to another city.

1954

did it in 1933-37.

In a 9-3 Reds win at Ebbets Field, watched by a chilly rain-soaked 522
paying fans, Ted Kluszewski belts his 49th homer of the year. Joe Nuxhall
wins his 2nd this year at Ebbets Field, the only lefty opponent to do so.

1955
The Yankees, trailing the Indians by a half-game with 11 games to play,
open a critical series with the Red Sox. The Yankees take a 3-0 lead, but
are behind 4-3 in the 9th. Hank Bauer then hits a HR off reliever Ellis
Kinder to tie it, and with 2 outs Yogi Berra cracks the game-winning HR to
win it 5-4. When Detroit beats Cleveland, 3-0, the Yanks move into first to
stay. Slugger Mickey Mantle tears a hamstring muscle running out a bunt. He
will make just 2 pinch-hit appearances in September, and he will go to bat
in the WS just 10 times.

Kansas City scores 7 runs in the first inning and rolls to a 13-7 win over the
faltering White Sox. The 3rd place Sox lose their 10th in 17 games. Hector
Lopez hits a 3-run homer in the first to start the scoring and later in
the game Joe Astroth adds a 3-run homer. George Kell and Chico Carrasquel
homer for the Sox. In the 8th, 16-year-old shortstop Alex George debuts for
Kansas City, handling two chances in the field flawlessly and striking out
in his one at-bat. George will go 1 for 10 in this his only ML season.

1956
At Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, Mantle explodes an 8th-inning shot, his
49th of the year, off the RF upper deck, matching a shot of Ted Williams
earlier in the year, but Early Wynn hangs on for a 4-3 Indians 2nd-game
win. But the Yankees win the opener, 10-3, to clinch a tie and eliminate

The Pirates keep their slim pennant hopes alive as they win a suspended game
from the Cards, 2-1, then take the regular game, 3-1, behind Ron Kline. In the
opener, young George Witt (9-2) picks up where he left off when the game was
suspended 6 weeks ago, winning his 8th straight game. For Witt, plagued with
arm troubles all year, it is his last appearance of the year, as he leaves
on the 24th to finish his senior year at Long Beach State. Witt's 1.61 ERA in
106 innings is the NL's best. Alas, he'll go 0-7 next season with a 6.96 ERA.

Yankee killer Frank Lary is the 3rd pitcher to beat them 7 times in the
same season, as the Tiger star defeats them, 4-2. Ed Walsh (9-1 in 1908)
and Ed Cicotte (7-1 in 1916) were the others. But Lary sets the AL record
for most wins in a season against the pennant winner. The NL record is 8,
by Bob Buhl in 1956.

the year.

the O's just .002 in back of New York. But Lopez and Maris crack homers
to back Whitey Ford's 4-2 win over the Birds. The 2 runs off Ford were the
first the Birds have scored off him at the Stadium in 33 2/3 innings. Shantz
rescues Whitey in the 9th. Three days later, during a doubleheader, the
Yankees will sweep Baltimore. The faltering Birds, now four back, will end
up in second place, eight games back.

1961
At Detroit, Roger Maris connects for #57, off Frank Lary, to stay a game
ahead of Ruth's 1927 pace. But Lary wins his 21st, 10-4, over Ralph Terry,

1965
At Fenway Park in front of only 1,247 fans, Boston right-hander Dave
Morehead, who will lead the league in losses with 18 this season, no-hits
the visiting Indians, 2-0. On the same day, the 100-loss bound ninth-place
Red Sox fire their general manager, Pinky Higgins. Owner Tom Yawkey rewrites
Morehead's contract giving the 22-year-old a $1,000 bonus. Morehead lost a
no-hitter against Cleveland in 1963 on Fred Whitfield's bad-hop single in the

Chicago Cubs, 2-0. The Dodgers will win their next 3, all by shutouts, in
St. Louis. Osteen helps his own cause in the 2-run second inning by lining
a hit off the shoe of Cubs pitcher Bill Faul. Faul, who says he goes into
a trance to make his pitches invisible to batters, exits. Sandy Koufax,
who lost on the 13th, 2-1, on Billy Williams' 2-run HR, earns the save in
the ninth by retiring 3. A crowd of 550 pays at Wrigley Field earning the

with a hit shared by Richie Ashburn (1948, Phillies) and Alvin Dark (1948,

at Shea Stadium.

(the remainder of the season) for violating baseball's drug policy. Nixon,
who had been arrested on charges of cocaine possession in 1987, is

to the suspension. Cincinnati P Norm Charlton is suspended for 7 days and
fined an undisclosed amount for admitting he intentionally threw at Dodgers

Bonehead baserunning almost costs the Dodgers a win over the Reds. With
one out in the 11th, and the score 3-3, L.A. has Jose Offerman on 3B, with
Brett Butler on 1B. When Lennie Harris hits a ground ball, Offerman tries to
score but fails to touch the plate and is tagged out on the throw. Harris is
called out for passing Butler, who inexplicably stands watching the play. But

hitless ball. Edgar Martinez collects his 50th double, just the 5th player

The Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston's grand reopening ceremony for its
Roxbury facility, which underwent a $7-million renovation, has some
community leaders upset with the building's new name to be unveiled at the
event. Although the previous owner of the Red Sox created the charitable
foundation that donated $3 million used to renovate the run-down club,
some in the minority neighborhood believe it would be wrong to name the
clubhouse after Tom Yawkey because his policies were racially motivated as
evidenced by passing up an opportunity to get Jackie Robinson and the team
becoming the last to integrate in the major leagues.

In a 12-6 loss to the Rangers in Texas, Angels center fielder Chone Figgins
triples in the ninth inning to become the fifth player in franchise history to

World Series championship in 1924 and continued to write for the paper

thanking the admiring and supportive fans attending the game at Comerica Park.

2010
Following appeals, Nyjer Morgan will serve an eight-game suspension in place
of the two original bans that totaled 15 games. The Nationals' outfielder

a Philadelphia fan getting hit and then a week later was handed an eight-game
suspension for his instigation and participation in a brawl with Florida.

With his 48th homerun against the Chicago Cubs, Eugenio Suarez set a new
