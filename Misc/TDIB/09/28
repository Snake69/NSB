1901
In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, Boston rookie Jake Volz walks 9 Brewers,
but still wins, 10-9, in a game called after 7 innings. Manager Jimmy
Collins has 2 homers and Hobe Ferris wins the game with a 2-run triple in
the bottom of the 7th. This is the season finale for Boston and it is the
3rd doubleheader in a row shortened because of darkness. Boston takes the
opener, 8-5.

1903
Boston (AL) tops St. Louis, 6-0, for their 20th shutout of the year.

Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss announces that, despite rumors to the
contrary, the Pittsburgh-Boston world's championship will be played as
scheduled. A party of Pittsburgh fans will leave for Boston on the 28th.

1905
In a game that helps decide the pennant, the A's beat the White Sox, 3-2,
as LF Topsy Hartsell scores from 2nd base with the winning run in the 7th
inning. Harry Davis' RBI single to short left hits Hartsell's mitt, which
the left fielder had left in the outfield at the end of the inning. The
A's win tomorrow, 11-1.

1906
At New York, the Giants pepper Fred Beebe while Christy Mathewson coasts
to an 8-1 lead. With the game in hand, Christy leaves after 8 innings, and
his brother Henry Mathewson makes his ML debut. Henry allows an unearned
run in the 9th and the Giants win, 8-2.

After losing and tying yesterday in Cleveland, the Highlanders split today,
winning 2-0 and losing 2-1. Cleveland is just a game behind the Highlanders.

Eli Cates of Oakland (PCL) pitches his second no-hitter of the month,
beating Los Angeles. Cates stopped Fresno without any hits on September
2. He will pitch a 3rd no-hitter next June 25 against Portland to set a
PCL record with three.

1907
In Boston, the White Sox hand the Americans their 14th straight loss as
Nick Altrock outduels George Winter to win, 2-1.

Well, blame yourself. Red Ames forces 4 runs across the plate in the 7th
as the Giants lose to the Cardinals, 6-0. The game is called after 8 on
account of darkness.

The Pirates and Boston Doves split a pair with Pittsburgh taking the first
game, 7-3. The battery of Knott and Boultes prevails to win a tight one in
game 2, 6-5.

1908
Phils C Red Dooin is offered - and rejects - a bribe to lose the final
series with the Giants. The incident is not made public until 16 years
later. Nothing is proved.

1909
Before the start of the game in Pittsburgh, Fred Clarke is feted by
the fans. He is awarded more than $600 in gold and receives a watch from
Pittsburgh mayor William Magee. Against the Giants, Clark walks twice before
removing himself, and Wagner collects two doubles and a single. But the
Giants outslug the Pirates to win, 13-9.

1911
A scant few hundred fans see the worst game in AL history as the Highlanders
trounce the Browns, 18-12. The teams accumulate 29 hits, 20 walks and 12
errors. New York scores in each of 7 innings, steals a record 15 bases - 7
off C Jim Stephens in 2 innings, 8 off Nig Clarke. Hal Chase and Birdie Cree
lead the thieves with 4 steals each. Five Highlander runners are thrown out.

In Chicago, Joe Tinker doubles in 2 runs in the 3rd inning off Christy
Mathewson, and the Cubs make it hold up, winning 2-1.

Behind righty Jack Coombs, the Athletics clinch the AL pennant with an 11-5
victory over the Tigers.

1912
Having recovered from an operation for brain clots, Frank Chance is released
by the Cubs (though his team is heading for a 91-59 record, good for 3rd
place). He will manage the newly named New York Yankees for 2 years.

Boston nips the Giants, 2-1, in the first of a twinbill. The 2nd game ends
in a 6-6 7-inning tie. Cuban C Mike Gonzalez makes his debut for Boston in
the nitecap, going 0 for 2 and having 4 runners steal bases against him.

The Athletics sweep the lowly New York Highlanders, winning 5-4 and 4-2. The
loss in game 2 goes to Russ Ford, who loses his 20th game of the year. It's
been done before, but not until Sam Jones in 1925 and Mel Stottlemyre in
1966 will any other Yankee pitchers drop 20.

1916
In the 4th doubleheader whitewash in the NL this month, the Giants' Jeff
Tesreau tops the Braves, 2-0, in the opener. In the 2nd game, Ferdie Schupp
yields a 7th-inning single to Braves 1B Ed Konetchy, breaking up his no
hitter. Schupp finishes with a one-hit 6-0 win, and will end the year with
an ERA of 0.90 to lead the NL ... last year his 5.90 was last in the NL. For
New York, it is their 25th consecutive win.

At Brooklyn, the Phils close to a half-game behind New York as they beat
Brooklyn, 8-4. Alexander is the victor for the visiting Quakers.

1919
On the last day of the season, in a doubleheader match that draws 20,000,
the Giants beat the Phils, 6-1 and 7-1, at the Polo Grounds. The first game
takes just 51 minutes, a ML record fastest game ever. Tossing just 64 pitches,
Jess Barnes allows 5 hits to win his 25th, over Lee Meadows. The record for
the shortest NL game was set last week by the Reds. In 1912, the Giants played
a pre-World series exhibition with the Phils in just 39 minutes. Hal Chase
bails out and skips the game; his old friend John McGraw covers up saying
that the first sacker with the shady reputation has headed for California.

Against the Red Sox, Senators coach and comedian Nick Altrock starts the
7th inning, but leaves after the first 4 batters hit safely. The Sox score
5 runs in the inning, but Washington prevails, 8-7, with Jim Shaw finishing
up. Altrock will pitch another inning, but wait 5 years before doing so. Ruth
sits out the finale.

At Brooklyn, the Yankees beat the Dodgers, 5-2, in a Sunday exhibition game.

1920
On the strength of Jim Bagby's 30th win, the Indians beat the Browns,
9-5. The Indians now lead the idle Sox by one game and by 3 1/2 over the
New York, which can do no better than tie for the pennant now.

At Cincinnati, the Reds take a pair from the Pirates, winning 2-0 and
5-3. Dolf Luque leaves with a sore arm after one inning of the lidlifter
and Hod Eller throws 8 innings to win. Eller then goes 5 1/3 innings of
game 2 but leaves without a decision.

The Illinois grand jury indicts the 8 Chicago players in the 1919 WS scandal,
and Charles Comiskey immediately suspends the seven players (Chick Gandil
had retired before the season). Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Cap Huston
send a telegram to Chicago owner Charles Comiskey offering to place their
entire team at his disposal, following the suspension of 8 players in the
scandal. Comiskey says he cannot accept the proposal. The eight members
involved in the 'Black Sox Scandal' will be cleared of the charges by the
court, but on the same day, they will be banned for life from baseball by
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's first commissioner.

1923
At Yankee Stadium, three weeks after both pitchers have thrown no-hitters
versus the A's, Sam Jones of the Yankees and Howard Ehmke (20-17) of the Red
Sox clash. It is not Ehmke's day; he is routed after facing an AL-record
16 batters in an 11-run 6th inning, as manager Frank Chance declines to
relieve his ace in mid-inning. The Yankees beat the Red Sox, 24-4, with 30
hits in 55 at-bats, both AL records. Ruth is 5 for 6 with two doubles and
his 28th HR, Wally Schang adds 5 hits and Gehrig 4 hits, including 3 doubles.

In another slugfest, the Tiger maul the Indians, 17-3. Harry Heilmann is
4 for 4 to raise his average to .398.

The Giants beat Brooklyn, 3-0, behind Art Nehf to clinch the NL flag. Bob
Meusel's single off Grimes in the 1st inning scores 2, and he scores on
the front end of a double steal.

1924
Rogers Hornsby finishes the season with a .424 batting average to lead the
National League. The Cardinal second baseman easily outdistances Zack Wheat,
who finishes second in the race batting .375 for the Dodgers.

Dazzy Vance fires a 5-hitter at the Phillies, beating them 5-1, for his 28th
win. He strikes out 9, including 5 in a row, to run his season total to
277. Vance will win the MVP over Rogers Hornsby and his .424 average. One
sportswriter, Jack Ryder, will leave the cranky Hornsby off all 10 spots
on his ballot. Vance also wins a preseason bet with Brooklyn teammate Jack
Fournier. He bet that he would win more games than Fournier would hit HRs;
the first sacker tops the NL in round trippers with 27.

1925
At Yankee Stadium, the Tigers take game 1, 6-2, behind Ken Holloway, and the
Yankees rebound to win the nitecap, 7-6, behind Ben Shields. Shields gives up
a pair of homers to relief pitcher Jess Doyle, his only 2 ML round trippers.

1928
Ruth records his 53rd homer of the year and George Pipgras survives an 11-6
win over the Tigers to clinch the AL pennant for the Yankees. The A's will
finish 2 1/2 games out.

At St. Louis, Browns P Alvin Crowder beats his former teammates the Senators,
4-3, to finish with the AL best record, 21-5. He will later go back to
Washington and win 50 in 2 years for the Nats.

Sparked by Frankie Frisch's steal of home, the Cards score a ML-record 7
runs in the 15th inning to beat the Braves at Boston, 10-3. For Frisch, it
is his 2nd extra-inning steal of home (his first came against the Dodgers in
the 2nd game on July 20, 1927), a major league first and still the National
League record. The Cards tied the game in the 9th on Andy High's 2-out single.

1930
Babe Ruth returns to the scene of his youthful fame, the pitcher's mound at
Fenway Park, and hurls a 9-3 complete game win over the Red Sox. The last
time the 'Bambino' took the mound, he defeated the A's at the end of the 1921
season. Gehrig takes Ruth's LF position, ending his streak of 885 consecutive
games at 1B, and is 3 for 5 to finish the year at .379. Al Simmons, who sits
out the last game, leads the AL with a .381 mark. The third-place Yankees
are the first team in history to score more than a 1000 runs in a season
(1062). Next year they will set the all-time mark at 1067, but finish 2nd.

The Cubs bring down the season's curtain as Wilson has his 189th and 190th
RBIs in a 13-11 victory over the Reds. Wilson's major league RBI record will
remain untouched except to revise it upward by 1 in 1999 after baseball's
historian Jerome Holtzman finds a missing RBI in a game played in July
of 1930. With Riggs Stephenson and Kiki Cuyler each driving in 100 runs,
the Cubs repeat as the first all-100-RBI outfield this century. The Boston
outfield in 1894 also had the same credentials.

Bill Terry goes hitless as the Giants edge the Dodgers for 3rd place with a
10-inning win over the Phillies at the Polo Grounds. He finishes at .401,
and is the last NL player to hit over .400. The Giants set a 20th-century
single season batting average record of .319 (the Philadelphia Phillies
hit .349 in 1894).

The Cards' Dizzy Dean scatters 3 hits for a 3-1 victory over the Pirates'
Larry French in his ML debut. The 19-year-old rookie, fresh from the
Texas League, pitches the final game of the season for the pennant-winning
Cardinals. Diz adds a bunt single and eventually steals home. Backup OF Ray
Blades is 0 for 2 to drop his average below .400 (40 for 101). The Cards end
the season with 1004 runs scored and join the 1930 Yankees as the first teams
to score more than 1000 runs. No NL team will match that mark this century.

The major leagues end the season with an attendance record of 10.1 million
(8,200 per game). It won't be matched till 1940 when the majors reach
10.281 million.

1932
Connie Mack begins dismantling the Athletics by selling Al Simmons, Jimmy
Dykes and Mule Haas to the White Sox for an estimated $100,000.

In the opening game of the WS, Lou Gehrig's HR leads the Yankees to a 12-6
win over the Cubs.

1933
The AP announces its All-Star team, voted on by sports editors and writers,
and the top vote getters are Jimmie Foxx, Joe Cronin and Carl Hubbell. Gehrig
is on the second team behind Foxx, but Ruth did not make the squad.

In the Yankees' 11-9 win over visiting Washington, Gehrig plays the first
three innings, then leaves to prepare for his wedding tomorrow. Ruth takes
over 1B.

1934
At St. Louis, the Cardinals gain a tie for first before a crowd of just
6,500. The Giants are idle, as Dizzy Dean, on 2 days rest, shuts out the
Reds, 4-0, for his 29th win in the 2nd game. It is Diz' 6th shutout. In
the opener the Cards are victorious, 8-5.

1935
With nothing on the line, the pennant-winning Cubs finally lose to the
Cardinals, 7-5, on Medwick's 11th-inning homer off Fabian Kowalik. The
loss snaps Chicago's 21-game win streak, the longest in the majors since
the Giants of 1916, when New York won 26 games and tied one. However,
Chicago's win streak is the longest without a tie since 1880.

Before a paid crowd of 174 fans at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers win their 6th
in a row, beating the Phils, 12-2. Junior Frey is 2 for 5 with a three-run
HR before turning the shortstop job over to Rod Dedeaux, making his ML
debut. Rod will play just 2 games but will make his mark as a college coach.

The Indians sweep the Browns, 3-0 and 7-3, with Joe Vosmik (.350) going
1 for 7 at the day's end. He still leads Buddy Myer by 2 points, but will
lose the AL batting title by a point.

1938
At Wrigley, 34,465 fans show up for one of the most dramatic games in
history. The Pirates take a 3-1 lead in the 6th on Johnny Rizzo's 2-run
homer, his 21st of the year. Chicago ties it in the 6th, but the Bucs
score twice again in the 8th for a 5-3 lead. A weary Bill Lee relieves,
gives up a run, but gets starter Bob Klinger to hit into a DP. Klinger
then gives up a single and is lifted for little-used Bill Swift, who gives
up two runs, and the game is knotted at 5-5. Then, with two outs in the
9th inning, Cubs manager Gabby Hartnett hits the "homer in the gloaming"
against Mace Brown to break the tie and put the Cubs in first place ahead
of the Pirates with their 9th straight win. With 2 outs and none on base,
the umpires intended to call the game because of darkness after Hartnett's
turn at-bat. Rizzo ends the year with a ML record having homered in 9 parks,
including Baker's Bowl and Connie Mack Stadium.

In Detroit's 12-0 win over St. Louis, Birdie Tebbetts clubs a grand slam
for the Tigers, Detroit's 10th of the year. Five of the grand slams have
been hit by Rudy York, and the ten is a ML team record breaking the mark
set by the 1929 Cubs. George Gill (12-9) is the winner. St. Louis will like
what they see, acquiring Gill next spring in the Newsom trade.

1939
Starting the day with a 2 1/2 game lead, Cincinnati clinches the pennant
with Paul Derringer defeating 2nd-place St. Louis, 5-3, despite allowing
14 hits. It is Derringer's 25th win. He also drives in the go-ahead run in
the 6th with a single. Harry Craft adds an 9th-inning HR.

The Giants and Phillies combine for a record-setting 13 double plays in
their double header. The mark will be tied on September 6, 1948. New York
sweeps, winning 4-3 and 8-3.

1940
At Fenway, A's starter Chubby Dean goes all the way against the Red Sox
despite giving up 19 hits. The Sox fatten their averages, winning 16-4. Boston
will end the season with 5 consecutive wins and start the 1941 season with
another 5 consecutive wins, their longest streak over 2 seasons.

1941
Batting .399955, Ted Williams elects to play in a doubleheader against the
A's on the final day of the season rather than to back into the coveted
.400 average because the number is rounded up. Williams collects 4 hits
in 5 at-bats in the 12-11 first-game slugfest victory in Philadelphia to
bring his average to .404. He goes 2 for 3 in game 2 against rookie Fred
Caligiuri, who beats Lefty Grove, 7-1. Grove gives up 4 hits in the 1st
inning and leaves the game, his last ML appearance. Williams will finish
the season with a .4057 (.406) batting average, the first .400 hitter in
the AL since Harry Heilmann in 1923. Joe Cronin estimates that Williams hit
14 sacrifice flies in 1941, one of the years in which any fly advancing a
runner is charged as a time at-bat. Bobby Doerr drives in 3 runs in game
1, giving him 8 RBIs in his last 4 games, and 93 RBIs for the year. The
Red Sox finish with all 4 infielders over 90 RBIs (Foxx, 105; Tabor, 101;
Cronin, 95), 2nd to the 1934 Tigers and just the 2nd and last team this
century to reach the mark. All four infielders have hit 20 homeruns, the
only time this century that this has been accomplished. The Texas infield
of 2004 will be the second team to reach this.

A jubilant crowd at Ebbets Field watches as the Dodgers beat the Phillies,
5-1, handing the Phils their 111th loss, a club record. For Brooklyn, it is
their club-record 100th win. The crowd sets a new season attendance record
at 1,215,253.

1942
In a City Series battle between the Cubs and Sox, 41-year-old Ted Lyons
(14-6) shuts out the Northsiders on 3 hits and no walks in just 1 hour 18
minutes. Lyons then leaves to enlist as a private in the Marine Corps.

1945
Four bases on balls give Eddie Stanky of the Dodgers 147 walks for the season,
tying the mark held by Jimmy Sheckard of the Cubs in 1911. Brooklyn beats
the Pirates, 5-2, as Olmo adds a homer and 2 doubles.

1946
Brooklyn shells Braves 20-game winner Johnny Sain and wins, 7-4. Meanwhile,
Cardinal P Harry Brecheen quiets the Cubs, 4-1, to leave St. Louis tied
for 1st place with a game to play.

1947
As a benefit for the Babe Ruth Foundation, the first Old-Timers' Day game
is played at Yankee Stadium. The event, which will become a prestigious
tradition in the Bronx, is the brain child of Larry MacPhail, the club's
general manager.

Harry Walker hits .363 to win the National League batting title during the
season he is traded to the Phillies, after appearing in just ten games with
the World Champion Cardinals, a team in which he played a pivotal role. "The
Hat's" older brother, Dixie, also won a batting crown in the Senior Circuit
with a .357 BA for Brooklyn in 1944.

On the season's last day, the Browns, desperate for a ticket seller,
bring announcer Dizzy Dean in to pitch against the White Sox. Diz gives
up only 3 hits in 4 innings and laces a clean single in his only at-bat,
but a pulled leg muscle forces his retirement. The White Sox score all their
runs in the 9th to win, 5-2. Even with Diz, the game draws less than 16,000,
and the Browns finish the year with only 320,000 attendance, less than half
that of 1946. Three days before the finale a Browns' game drew only 350.

1948
In Cleveland, 60,405 fans are on hand for "Joe Early Night." Early, a
night watchman, had written Bill Veeck asking why the average fan is never
celebrated and Veeck took advantage of the promotional opportunity. The
first 20,000 female fans at the stadium receive a Princess Aloha orchid
flown in overnight from Hawaii, while Early (a WW II vet) receives a host
of gifts including a convertible, appliances, easy chair and a cocker
spaniel. The Indians then take advantage of the White Sox, winning 11-0,
behind Gene Bearden's 18th win. Dale Mitchell hits his 4th homer of the
year, and Allie Clark has a homer and three singles. With the Yankees and
Red Sox losing, the Indians now lead by two games with four to play. The
Tribe have now won 17 of their last 20.

In Philadelphia, the A's Carl Scheib outpitches Vic Raschi to beat the
Yankees, 5-2. The 4th place A's will finish the season at 84-70 and become
the first AL team to finish above .500 and score fewer runs (724 to 735)
than their opponents. The 1987 Twins will be the next and only AL team to
do it. In the NL, the 1930 Pirates were the first team to accomplish the feat.

Meanwhile, at Fenway, the Red Sox lose, 4-2, as Washington's ace Ray
Scarborough (14-8) allows six hits. Because of injuries, Scarborough has won
just one game in a month. After striking out in the 3rd, Williams answers
the Fenway Boo Birds by letting his bat fly towards the end of the Boston
dugout. In the 5th, Williams raises both index fingers after catching a fly.

Hank Arft's 8th inning homer - the 32nd given up by Detroit's Fred Hutchinson
this year - enables the Browns to win, 5-3. Fred Sanford (12-20) wins
despite giving up homers to rookie Johnny Groth and Hutchinson.

The Phils switch "bonus kids" Hugh Radcliffe (a $40,000 signee), Stan
Hollmig ($25,000) and Rudy Rufer ($10,000) to Toronto, thus exposing them
to the draft.

The Brooklyn football Dodgers ask waivers on Pepper Martin because of a
leg injury. The former major league star had been signed as a place kicker.

1949
The Yankees take a 4-run lead over the A's on homers by Bobby Brown and
Jim Delsing, but the A's come back to take a 5-4 lead in the 7th. New York
scores three runs in the last of the 7th, the go-ahead run on Phil Rizzuto's
squeeze bunt, and reliever Allie Reynolds holds on to beat Alex Kellner,
7-5. DiMaggio, down 18 pounds because of pneumonia, takes batting practice.

In Washington, the Red Sox score a run against Ray Scarborough, the Nats'
top pitcher, and lead 1-0 going into the 9th. But Washington scores twice
to win, the second run coming in when reliever Mel Parnell, facing Buddy
Lewis, bounces a 1-2 wild pitch in the dirt past C Birdie Tebbetts. The
Red Sox drop into a tie for first place.

Called up from Toronto in mid-September, Eddie Sanicki of the Phils gets
his 3rd hit of the season. All 3 are homers as he goes 3 for 13 with a .924
SA. On September 14 Sanicki homered on his first big-league at-bat with 2
men on, against Rip Sewell of the Pirates.

1950
The Phils lose their 2nd doubleheader in a row at the Polo Grounds. Sal
Maglie tops them in the opener, 3-1, and Sheldon Jones outmatches Roberts
to win, 3-1, in the 2nd game.

The Tigers win 3 out of 4 game in their series with the Browns, but only
have one winning pitcher - Hal White. He relieves in all 4 games, winning
three straight. The Tigers lose game 1 on the 26th, 4-1, with the defeat
going to Newhouser. White relieves Trout in the nitecap and wins, 5-3,
after hurling one inning. He replaced Art Houtteman yesterday in the 9th
and threw one pitch and won, 5-4. Today he relieves in the 10th and the
Tigers score in the 12th to win, 4-3.

1951
Allie Reynolds pitches his 2nd no-hitter of the season (on American Indian
Day), defeating the Red Sox in Yankee Stadium, 8-0. It is his 7th shutout
of the year. With 2 outs in the 9th, Ted Williams hits a foul pop that
catcher Yogi Berra drops. Williams then hits another foul fly in the same
spot that Berra grabs for the last out. The Chief (Reynolds is 1/4 Creek)
is the first AL hurler with two no-hitters in a season; Vander Meer's pair
in 1938 is the only other time a pitcher has thrown two in a season. In the
2nd game, the Yankees clinch their 3rd straight pennant under Casey Stengel
as Vic Raschi wins, 11-3, for his 21st victory. Mantle drives home three
runs with a pair of doubles and Joe DiMaggio belts the final homer of his
career - a three run shot. The Yankees are 3 1/2 games ahead of slumping
Cleveland with 2 to play.

In Philadelphia, Campanella belts his 33rd homer but Brooklyn blows a 3-0
lead to lose, 4-3, as the Phils score the winner in the 9th inning. The
Phils tie the game in the 8th on Andy Seminick's 2-run homer, his 1st in
7 weeks. The race is now tied (94-58) between the Giants and the Dodgers.

1952
On the last day of the season at Ebbets Field, the Braves' 77 years of
representing Boston is extended by three innings when Eddie Mathews'
ninth-inning two-out double ties the game. The contest is called due
to darkness and ends in the 12th inning in a 5-5 tie with the Dodgers.
The Dodger pitching staff sets a NL record for most strikeouts in a season
with 773 when Jim Hughes fans Sid Gordon in the 12th.

Stan Musial makes his only ML pitching appearance. With his 6th batting
title wrapped up, he takes the mound against the Cubs' Frank Baumholtz,
the runner-up in the batting race in a confrontation agreed upon before the
game. Baumholtz, batting righthanded, reaches base on an error by 3B Solly
Hemus, and Harvey Haddix, who had shifted to RF, comes back for Musial. The
Cubs win, 3-0, behind Paul Minner. Musial has one hit to finish the year
at .336 ... a hitless Baumholtz closes at .325.

The Phils' Robin Roberts wins his 28th game, the most in the league since
1935, a 7-4 win before 5,933 at the Polo Grounds. It is Roberts' 30th
complete game. Roberts is backed by homers from Willie Jones and Swish
Nicholson, while the Giants' Hank Thompson goes deep.

1953
The owners unanimously agree on moving the Browns from St. Louis to Baltimore
where the franchise will become known as the Orioles. The last place team,
who finishes the season with a 54-100 record, also finished last in attendance
averaging only 3,860 fans a game at Sportsman's Park.

1954
Two days after firing Bucky Harris, the Senators sign Chuck Dressen to a
2-year deal to manage in 1955.

1955
The Yanks win the first game of the WS, as Whitey Ford beats Don Newcombe,
6-5. In a controversial play with Frank Kellert at-bat, Jackie Robinson
steals home in the 8th to bring the Dodgers to within a run of a tie. Films
later disclose that Robinson is out by a whisker, but Yankee C Yogi Berra
actually balked on the play, receiving Whitey Ford's pitch before Kellert
could swing at it. In the bottom of the second inning, Elston Howard,
in his first World Series at-bat, knots the score at two to two when he
homers off right-hander Newcombe. The round-tripper to deep left field at
Yankee Stadium marks the first time a black batter has hit a homerun off
a black pitcher in the history of the Fall Classic.

In the last game at Minneapolis' Nicollet Park, the Millers (American
Association) clip the Rochester Red Wings (International League), 9-4, in
the 7th game of the Junior World Series. The win gives the Millers their
first-ever Jr WS Championship.

1956
In the opener of 3 games with visiting Boston, the Yanks top the Sox,
7-2. Williams is 0 for 3, and needs 6 at-bats to qualify for the batting
title. Mantle goes 1 for 4, but his one hit is a homer off Bob Porterfield. It
is Mantle's last homer - and last hit - of the season.

1957
Ed Roebuck gets the last Brooklyn victory, an 8-4 win over the hometown
Phils. Randy Jackson hits the last Brooklyn Dodgers homerun. Phils backup
1B Marv Blaylock gets his first hit since June 15th, a pinch homer in the
6th against Brooklyn's Rene Valdez. The HR comes in Marv's last ML at-bat.

City. New Trier High School star Chuck Lindstrom, son of Fred, walks his
first time up, then triples in his only ML at-bat after being tipped off

ML appearance, relieves in the 6th for the win. It is the last appearance
for both players.

1959
The Braves, who ended the National League regular season in a first-place
tie with the Dodgers, lose game 1 of the three-game series, 3-2, in front
of a spare crowd of 18,297 at County Stadium in a cold drizzle. Rookie
Larry Sherry pitches 7 2/3 innings of scoreless relief. Milwaukee will lose
tomorrow's game in L.A. spoiling their chance for a three-peat as NL Champs.

Cubs manager Bob Scheffing (208-254) resigns and is replaced by Charlie
Grimm, making his 3rd appearance in the dugout for the Cubs. Grimm managed

1960
At Fenway, in his final ML plate appearance, against Baltimore's Jack Fisher
(12-11), Ted Williams picks out a 1-1 pitch and drives it 450 feet into the
right-CF seats behind the Boston bullpen. It is Williams' 521st and last
HR, putting him 3rd on the all-time list. Williams stays in the dugout,
ignoring the crowd's cheers, but when he trots out to LF in the 9th, he
is replaced immediately by Carroll Hardy. The Splendid Splinter retires
as a standing crowd roars. The Sox rally for 2 runs in the 9th, featuring
a double by Vic Wertz, to give the 7th-place Red Sox a 5-4 victory. Wertz
ends the year with 103 RBIs, and just 49 runs scored ... this is the fewest
runs for anyone with 100 RBIs.

Sox, 7-3, spoiling Early Wynn's bid for his 300th win.

off Joey Jay to move into 1st place by a game over San Francisco.

1966
Larry Jaster (11-5) blanks the Dodgers for the 5th time this season,
pitching the Cards to a 2-0 win against Don Sutton at St. Louis. Jaster is
the first pitcher to accomplish this feat since Grover Cleveland Alexander
whitewashed the Reds 5 times in 1916. Senator Tom Hughes also did it
against the Indians in 1905. Jaster twice beat the Dodgers, by 2-0 and 4-0
scores. The Dodger whitewashings are Jaster's only shutouts of the year,
but they are enough to lead the league. He will pitch another five years
in the majors, recording just two more shutouts.

defeat ties an American League record, matching the mark established by
the 1914 Yankees.

Although the future Hall of Famer gives up 16 hits, Giants right-hander
Gaylord Perry goes the distance earning a 10-4 victory over the Reds at
Crosley Field. Cincinnati's 14 singles and two doubles cannot overcome
their two errors and a three-run poke by Willie McCovey.

Seeking his 32nd win, Denny McLain pitches 7 scoreless innings against
Washington and leaves with a 1-0 lead. But the Senators score 2 in the 9th

in a 4-1 win versus Houston.

relay throw, and is forced to leave the game. His pinch runner scores and
the Mets go on to win, 6-3, on 2-run homers in the 9th and 10th by Clendenon
and Garrett. Hoyt Wilhelm is the loser in his only Cub decision.

Jack Billingham strikes out 12 and shuts out the Giants, 3-0. Billingham

In his last start of the year, Nolan Ryan pitches his 3rd (of 7) career
no-hitter, victimizing the Twins, 4-0. In the process, the Angels hurler
strikes out 15 batters for the 6th time this season. Ryan also walks 8 to run
his season total to 202 base on balls, joining Bob Feller in 1938 as the only
pitcher to walk more than 200 in a season. Ryan will also top 200 in 1977.

Astro Don Wilson 2-hits the Braves, 5-0. It will be Wilson's last ML game,
followed barely 3 months later by his suicide.

The Pirates move a game ahead of 2nd-place St. Louis by beating the Mets,
7-3. Richie Zisk and Richie Hebner sock HRs.

1975

the on Saturday.

Put me in, coach! Two hours before game time, Milwaukee fires manager
Del Crandall. Harvey Kuenn fills in as the Brewers win their finale, 7-0,

Diego Padres. Jack Billingham (12-10) is the winner. Randy Jones takes
the loss but sets a NL record with 112 errorless chances. The ML record
is held by Frank Owen of the 1904 White Sox, who did not commit an error
in 151 chances (121 assists, 30 POs). Jones finishes the year with 12 DPs,
tying the NL record. He also finishes with the NL lead in wins (22), games
started (40) and completed (25), IPs (315 1/3) and hits allowed.

1978
Mike Torrez wins his 1st game in a month, stopping the Tigers on 3-hits
to win, 1-0. There are only two putouts by the Sox outfield. Boston's lone

he faced before Bush singled, and settles for a 3-0 one-hitter. In game 2,
the Twins stake starter Terry Felton (0-13) to a 3-0 lead but the Jays tie it
up, knocking Felton out of his last ML game. The Jays win it, 4-3. Felton's
no-decision leaves the 24-year-old right hander with a lifetime mark of 0-16,
a major league record for most career losses without recording a victory.

Phillies clinch the NL East championship at Wrigley Field. Bo Diaz goes 5

the month. The clincher is Philadelphia's 7000th win in franchise history.

1984
Bruce Sutter ties the ML record with his 45th save of the season in the
Cardinals' 4-1 10-inning win over the Cubs. Starter Joaquin Andujar (20-14)
allows 2 hits over 9 innings to win his 20th game.

Kansas City clinches the AL West title with a 6-5 win over Oakland. The

pitcher who had just beat them.

In his last start of the regular season, Orel Hershiser pitches 10 shutout
innings to extend his consecutive-scoreless-inning streak to 59, breaking
Dodger Don Drysdale's ML record by one. San Diego's Andy Hawkins also
pitches 10 shutout innings and the Padres eventually win 2-1 on Mark Parent's
homerun in the bottom of the 16th. Hershiser's streak gets some help when
umpire Paul Runge makes an interference call at 2B on a run-scoring double
play. Hershiser ends the month with a 5-0 record and an ERA of 0.00. His
streak started on August 30th with 4 shutout innings against Montreal.

In a 5-2 loss to Oakland, Minnesota's Bert Blyleven plunks 3 batters in

victory over the Athletics.

bullpen for the 75th straight time, surpassing the record set by the 1977
Padres. Reliever Greg Cadaret takes the loss, while Eric Bell (3-0) wins
in relief to also set a record - most wins without a loss on a team with

in a game, as they rally to defeat the Astros, 12-11 in 11 innings. Craig

a grand slam, as the Mariners top Texas, 6-2. The M's hold a 2 game lead
over the Angels.

The Reds defeat the Expos by a score of 9-7, as Expos reliever Greg Harris
switch-pitches the 9th ambidexterously. The Reds don't score against him as
he faces two with his (normal) right arm and two with his left. After Harris
(right-handed) retires Reggie Sanders on a grounder, manager Felipe Alou
permits him to do what he had wanted to try for 10 years. Following a wild
lefty toss to the backstop, he walks Hal Morris. Remaining as a southpaw,
though, he gets Eddy Taubensee to ground out. Finally, returning the ball to
his right hand, he retires Bret Boone on a ground out. Harris uses a special
six-finger glove, which is sent to the Hall of Fame. Before Harris, Bert
Campaneris was the last pitcher to use both hands in a professional game,
doing it in 1962 for Daytona Beach in the Florida State League. The only
major leaguers to toss with each hand are:  Tony Mullane (July 18, 1882),
Larry Corcoran (June 10, 1884), John Roach (May 14, 1887), Elton "Icebox"
Chamberlain (May 9, 1888) and Tony Mullane again (July 14, 1893).

the loss on Roger Clemens (10-13) in his last appearance in a Boston
uniform. Clemens strikes out 10 and allows homers to Mike Aldrete and
Bernie Williams. The Sox are reluctant to grant the Rocket's request for
a 4-year contract.

1997
With his 40th homerun, catcher Mike Piazza sets a single season Los
Angeles Dodger record. Duke Snider holds the franchise record slugging 43
round-trippers for Brooklyn in 1956.

Toronto's Roger Clemens goes 8 1/3 innings against his former team, but
doesn't get a decision when the Blue Jays score two runs in the bottom of the

will finish the season with a 21-7 record, the best winning percentage for
a starting pitcher on a team that will finish last.

Colorado hands Los Angeles a 13-9 defeat, as Neifi Perez leads the way with
5 hits and 3 runs batted in.

a 2-hitter. Raul Casanova has both hits for the Brewers. Young is 4 for 4,
including 2 triples, with 4 runs.

44th playing the hot corner breaking the league record for homers by a
third baseman set in 1953 by Al Rosen.

The Orioles roast the Blue Jays, 23-1, to eliminate Toronto from any possible
spot in the playoffs. The 23 runs scored is an O's team record. The Orioles
score 10 runs in the 4th inning, highlighted by Brady Anderson's 200th
career HR. Darrin Fletcher hits his 20th homer of the year for Toronto,
giving the Blue Jays 7 players with 20 or more HRs on the season. That ties
the AL record set by Baltimore in 1996.

Angels infielder David Eckstein breaks Frank Robinson's rookie record for
getting hit by a pitch. The Halos' shortstop is struck by Rangers hurler

plunked this season.

On a night he hits his 68th round tripper of the season in quest of Mark
McGwire's single season homerun record, Barry Bonds is walked for the
163rd time breaking "Big Mac's" 1998 National League record for bases on
balls. The major league record is 170 walks held by Babe Ruth.

Kevin Millar's 10th-inning HR gives the Marlins a 6-5 win over the Phils
and drops them 2 games behind the Braves in the NL East.

Ron Santo, the team's radio color commentator joins Hall of Famers Ernie Banks
and Billy Williams becoming the third player to have his number retired by

15-year career with the Chicago (1960-73), will have his uniform #10 below
Ernie Banks' on the left-field foul pole.

At Turner Field in Atlanta, Jose Reyes becomes the second Mets player to
hit a homerun from both sides of the plate in one game. Lee Mazzilli was the
first when he went yard twice against the Dodgers in LA on September 3, 1978.

Following an emotional closing ceremony, the Braves beat the Phillies,
5-2, in the final game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. The two-hour

the introduction of the All-Vet team and a eulogy given by Hall of Fame
broadcaster Harry Kalas, who receives a standing ovation from the 58,554
enthusiastic fans in attendance.

The Yankees win, 3-1, over Baltimore as David Wells (15-7) goes 7 2/3 innings
for his 200th career victory and last win as a Yankee. Acting manager Roger
Clemens removes him in the 8th. Drew Henson hits a seeing-eye single for

he gives up baseball and $12 million for NFL football.

homeruns by a right-handed batter. The third baseman's 47th homer proves

With the lowest winning percentage ever compiled by a division champion
during a non-strike year, the Padres (79-79) win their fourth division flag
in the 37-year history of the franchise. San Diego, which needs to win three
of their last four games just to finish above .500, accomplish the feat by
surpassing the Mets, who previously possessed the dubious record by going
82-79 (.509) to win the NL East in 1973.

2006

franchise in big league history to accomplish this dubious feat.

At Coors Field in Colorado, James Loney (filling in for Nomar Garciaparra)
collects four hits, including two homers, and drives in nine runs in a

the franchise RBI mark set by Gil Hodges in his 1950 four-homer game and
breaks the Los Angeles club mark held by Ron Cey.

2008
On the last day of the season, 39-year-old Yankee right-hander Mike Mussina
(20-9) becomes the oldest pitcher to win 20 games in a season for the first
time. The 18-year career veteran tosses six shutout innings against the
Red Sox in New York's 6-2 Fenway Park victory.

With a 4-2 loss to the Marlins, the Mets play their final game at Shea Stadium
disappointing a sell-out crowd by failing to qualify for the post-season
on the last day of the season for the second consecutive year. After the
contest, former Mets, including Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Yogi Berra
and Tom Seaver, as well as Darryl Strawberry, Dwight 'Doc' Gooden and Mike
Piazza, but not any of the club's current players, take part in a ceremony
to celebrate the history of the 45-year-old ballpark in front of the subdued
spectators gathered to 'Shea Goodbye'.

Pitching on a day's short rest, CC Sabathia tosses a complete game,
defeating the Cubs, 3-1. The victory, along with the Mets' loss to Florida
an hour later, makes the Brewers the NL Wild Card and puts Milwaukee in
the postseason for the first time since 1982.

The Astros set a new National League mark for the fewest errors committed
in one season. The 67 Houston miscues are one less than the record shared
by the 1999 Mets and 2007 Rockies.

2009
The Angels clinch their fifth AL West title in the last six years with their
11-0 win over Texas. Although the team has been very successful reaching
the postseason, Los Angeles has won just one playoff series since winning
game 7 of the 2002 World Series for their only championship. The Angels
acquire left-hander Scott Kazmir (8-7, 5.92) from the Rays in exchange for
two prospects, left-hander Alex Torres and infielder Matt Sweeney, as well
as a highly touted minor league player to be named later. The Rays deals
the 25-year-old talented southpaw, who is in the first year of a three-year
$28.5 million contract, due to restrictions in the organization's payroll.

2010
David Wright sets the all-time Mets record for strikeouts in a season with
157. The third baseman passes the infamous mark shared by Dave Kingman
(1982) and Tommie Agee (1970).

2011
With their season-finale extra-inning victory over Atlanta, the Phillies
set a team record with their 102nd win of the campaign. The 4-3 victory
also moves skipper Charlie Manuel (646-488) past Gene Mauch for the most
wins by a manager in the history of the franchise.

The Braves become the first team in major league history to blow a lead
of at least eight games in September when the team is eliminated from
the playoffs on the last day of the season, losing to Philadelphia in 13
innings, 4-3. On August 26, Atlanta was 10 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis,
the eventual Wild Card team.

On the final day of the season, the Brewers beat the Pirates, 7-3, for
their 96th victory of the season to break the franchise record for victories
established in 1979 and tied in 1982. The National League Central Division
champs finish the season 96-66, the second best record in the circuit
trailing only Philadelphia.

Trailing 7-0 going into the eighth, the Rays complete their storybook
finish on the final day of the season with a ninth-inning two-out two-strike
game-tying pinch-hit solo homerun hit by Dan Johnson, and Evan Longoria's
walk-off round-tripper in the 12th. The victory, along with the Red Sox'
4-3 loss to Baltimore minutes before, gives Tampa Bay the AL wild-card berth,
after being down by nine games at the beginning of the month.

The Marlins attract 34,615 fans to their finale at Dolphin Stadium, now
known as Sun Life Stadium, but will still post the poorest attendance
in the National League for the sixth consecutive year. The last place
club, which has played in its current venue during the first 19 years of
the franchise's existence, will play next season's home games in a new
ballpark with a retractable roof located on approximately 17 acres of the
historic 42-acre Orange Bowl site in the Little Havana section of Miami.
Ozzie Guillen, who signed a four-year $10 million deal with Florida, is
introduced before the season's finale as the club's new manager, replacing
80-year-old interim manager Jack McKeon. The outspoken former White Sox
skipper is expected, in addition to bringing a better product on the field,
to help spark enthusiasm for the team as they start a new era playing in
a new ballpark as the Miami Marlins.
