1901
The White Sox sweep a doubleheader - and the 4-game series - with Boston by
topping the Somersets, 4-3 and 6-4. Boston's Buck Freeman belts his 12th homer
of the year. Chicago (75-46) now has a seven-game lead over Boston (67-52).

1904
Cold weather keeps the crowd to 1,844 in New York as the Giants' Joe
McGinnity allows 12 Philley hits but wins his 31st, 6-4. The nitecap is
called after 5 innings and no score.

1907
Boston's Cy Young and the A's Rube Waddell battle to a 13-inning scoreless
tie. Neither pitcher walks a batter.

The Giants play their 5th doubleheader in a week, splitting shutouts with
Boston. New York takes the opener, 10-0, then Irv Young outpitches Christy
Mathewson, 1-0, in the 7-inning nitecap.

1908
In a 7-3 New York win, the Giants steal 9 bases off Brooklyn's Billy Maloney,
an outfielder pressed into service as a catcher. That's enough to make him
quit the game. Following the game John McGraw makes his stage debut in a
show at the Hippodrome. He has a small part in the show "Sporting Days."

1909
The Pirates beat the Reds, 3-1. Charles "Moon" Gibson of Pittsburgh catches
his 112th consecutive game, breaking Chief Zimmer's 1890 record. His streak
will end at 140.

Chicago's Orval Overall tops the St. Louis Cardinals, 2-1 for his 15th
straight win over the Birds. He started the streak on June 6, 1906. It is
the longest Cub winning streak by one pitcher over a single team.

Bill Dinneen, winner of 3 games in the first WS, is released by the St. Louis
Browns and becomes an AL umpire, a position he will hold through 1937.

1911
Red Sox rookie Buck O'Brien shuts out the A's, 2-0, in his first major
league start. He won't be scored upon for 20 innings.

Detroit's Pat Mullin pitches a 1-0 shutout over the White Sox, and gets
some help when Lee Tannehill's liner is caught by LF Delos Drake who turns
it into a triple play, throwing to Donie Bush who relays to 1B Del Ganier.

1912
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants sweep two from Brooklyn, 2-1 and 7-2. Jumbo
Jeff Tesreau takes the opener and Mathewson the nitecap.

1913
The Red Sox collect 21 assists against Detroit in a 3-2 win.

1914
In the opener at Boston, the Phils win their only game in the series,
10-3, behind Pete Alexander. In game 2 of a doubleheader, George A. Davis,
a Harvard law student, pitches the only shutout of his brief career, a 7-0
no-hitter for the first-place Braves over the Phils. The spitballer walks
the bases loaded with no outs in the 5th, but "he rose to the occasion to
prove his perfect candidacy to a niche in the hall of stars," writes the
Boston Post. Released by the Highlanders in 1912, Davis will be 3-3 this
year and next, then hang up his glove to start a law practice. Only Bumpus
Jones (2) and Bobo Holloman (3) have fewer career victories for pitchers
that have thrown no-hitters than the 24-year-old right-hander.

At Washington, the Senators' Jack Bentley shuts out New York, 1-0. Jack
Warhop takes the loss, his 5th 1-0 loss of the year, which ties the AL
record set by Bill Donovan in 1903. It won't be topped by any pitcher. Also
not topped, or tied, is Warhop's loss today to the Senators, the 3rd time
this year they've beaten him, 1-0. No pitcher will tie Warhop's ML record.

1915
Boston's Lefty Tyler allows just one Brooklyn hit, but loses 1-0. Jeff Pfeffer
is nearly as perfect, allowing 2 hits for the win. Brooklyn scores the lone
run on a walk by Hy Myers, Gus Getz' single, a double steal, and a sac fly.

1916
Hippo Vaughn and Jimmy Lavender shut out the Pirates, 3-0 and 2-0, for a
Cubs' doubleheader victory.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

In Washington, Boston's Babe Ruth tops the Senators and Walter Johnson,
2-1. Ruth gives up 4 hits while Johnson allows 8. It is the Babe's 4th win
this season versus Johnson. Washington wins the nitecap, 4-3, in 10 innings.

1917
Grover Alexander beats New York's Jeff Tesreau, 4-1. Ferdie Schupp takes
the nitecap, 2-1, for New York, beating the Phils' Eppa Rixey.

In Chicago, with the score tied 3-3 in the 10th inning between the Sox
and the Indians, umpire Brick Owens forfeits the game to Chicago, 9-0,
because of the 'dilatory tactics' of the Tribe. Chicago now leads the AL
by 7 games. The Cleveland players protest Owens' ruling in the 10th when,
with two on and no outs, he calls Jack Graney out on a close play. The
ensuing argument delays the game ten minutes with several Indians rolling
on the ground and tossing their mitts. When Chicago's first hitter, pitcher
Dave Danforth, strikes out to open the bottom of the inning, Indian catcher
Steve O'Neill fires the ball into CF, whereupon Owens calls the forfeit.

The Cubs' Phil Douglas stops the Pirates on 3 hits to beat Wilbur Cooper, 1-0.

1918
In game 4, Ruth bats in 2 runs on a triple in the 4th and pitches 7 scoreless
innings before the Cubs tie it in the 8th, ending Ruth's WS record of 29 2/3
scoreless innings. Shufflin' Phil Douglas relieves Lefty Tyler for Chicago
in the last of the 8th and throws away the game, first by a wild pitch,
then with an error. Ruth is the winning pitcher, but Mays relieves with 2
on and no out in the 9th.

Finners Quinlan, an OF who last played in 1915, is wounded fighting in a
battle at Argonne Wood, France. He loses an eye and his right leg.

1920
In the opener of the pivotal 3-game series, Cleveland blasts the Yanks,
10-4, behind the pitching of Stan Coveleski and the hitting of Doc
Johnston. Johnston has 4 hits, two of them triples, and a steal of home. Ruth
hits his 47th homer in the first, then receives 3 intentional walks.

1921
An AL record for total runs and hits is made when Chicago beats Detroit
20-15. Each team has 20 hits. Earl Sheely has 5 runs for Chicago.

1922
Danville's Otto Pahlman (III League) has his 50-game hitting streak
stopped. Now in 2nd place, he'll end the century with the 4th longest streak
ever in the minors.

At Sportsman Park, Baby Doll Jacobson collects 3 triples to lead the
Browns to a 16-0 whitewash of the Tigers. The victory, the most lopsided
in Browns' history, goes to pitcher Elam Vangilder. St. Louis totals
20 hits with Ken Williams hitting a homer in his 5th straight game, his
37th of the year. Sisler has 3 hits to keep his hit streak alive, as the
Browns keep pace with New York, winners in 10 innings against Washington.
Jacobson will hit 94 three-baggers during his 11-year career

1923
In an IL game, the Syracuse Stars are leading, 3-2, in the 7th and final
inning when ump George Magerkurth calls a Baltimore runner safe, giving the
Orioles a last chance at-bat. Stars manager Frank Shaughnessy protests and
the fans agree with him by pouring out onto the field, and the ump awards
the forfeit win to the O's.

1926
Trailing 6-3 at the end of 8 innings, Brooklyn then makes 9 hits and adds two
walks to win going away, 12-6. A NL record five Brooklyn pinch hitters all
deliver, including pinch hitter Dick Cox, who gets 2 hits, scores twice,
and has 2 RBIs in a 9-run 9th inning. Pinch hitter Moose Clabaugh bats
twice in the 9th, collecting a hit. The six pinch hits sets a ML record
and the 3 pinch runners scoring ties a ML mark set in 1900. The Phils use
a record-tying 5 pitchers in the 9th with Waylon Dean taking the loss. The
Phils are again paced by Cy Williams, who clubs two homers in his first
two at-bats (three in a row), before striking out in his next.

1928
A total of 85,265 jam Yankee Stadium to watch the Yankees sweep 2 from the
A's, 3-0 and 7-3, to move back into first place to stay. George Pipgras is
the winner in the first game while the Yankee star of the nitecap is Bob
Meusel, who takes an Ed Rommel knuckler out of the park for a grand slam
in the 8th. Waite Hoyt is the winner.

At Ebbets Field, the Robins come from behind to edge the Giants, 3-2, behind
Dazzy Vance. Harvey Hendrick dinks a 2-run homer in the 8th off Larry Benton
to tie, and Jake Flowers singles with 2 out in the 9th to drive home the
winner. The ecstatic fans respond by covering the field with straw hats.

The Cards blow a 7-3 lead and lose to Pittsburgh, 8-7. Their lead is cut to
2 1/2 games. Pete Alexander blows the lead, but the loss goes to reliever
Art Reinhart. Hafey and Bottomley homer for the Cards, but the Bucs answer
with 7 hits from the Waners. Paul, leading the NL with .381, has 4 of them.

Chicago's Alex Metzler breaks up a pitching duel between Ted Lyons and
Willis Hudlin by cracking an 8th-inning pinch homer to tie Cleveland,
1-1. The Sox get one more, then explode for 8 runs in the 9th inning to
coast, 10-1. This is Metzler's 3rd and last roundtripper of the year and he
will tie Bill Barrett for the team lead. His 55 RBIs will be 2nd on the Sox.

At age 38, Yankee P Urban Shocker dies of pneumonia in Denver, where he had
gone for his health. Only now does it become known that he had suffered from
an enlarged heart and was unable to sleep lying down for 2 years. Shocker,
who never had a losing season, was 18-6 in 1927 but appeared in only one
game in 1928.

1929
Chicago drives Sam Jones to the showers with three runs in the 7th, as the
White Sox beat the Senators, 7-4. Young Ed Walsh is the winner, allowing
six hits. Cissell hits for the circuit while Willie Kamm adds two triples
and a double.

The Cubs win their 90th, beating Boston, 4-3. Following two rain delays,
Hack Wilson hits his 37th homer in the 7th to tie the game at 2-2. After
Charlie Root walks in a run in the 9th, Riggs Stephenson's homer ties it
at 3-3, and two more hits hand Percy Jones the loss. Wilson and Chuck Klein
are now tied for the NL lead in homers.

At Cincinnati, the Giants' Fred Fitzsimmons beats the Reds, 10-4, in game 2

paying regular prices, raise $59,000 in the first matchup, as Babe Ruth
homers and the Yankees beat the Giants, 7-2. At Comiskey Park, a crowd of
34,865 raises $45,000 for Governor Emmerson's unemployment relief fund and
watch the Cubs trim the White Sox, 3-0, behind Charley Root. Root twirls
a 6-hitter and drives in all the runs.

1932
The Tigers beat the Yankees, 14-13, in a 14-inning game in which Lou Gehrig
hits a grand slam and drives in 8 runs. He has reached this RBI feat twice
before. Frankie Crosetti strikes out 4 times in the game, including twice
in one inning. Detroit also tops the Yanks, 4-1, in 5 innings to finally
complete the protested game of August 1st, and the tie of yesterday. The
Yanks score their lone run in the 3rd inning off Buck Marrow with their
only two hits of the game.

1936
The Yankees sweep the Indians, 11-3 and 12-9, to clinch the pennant on the
earliest date ever. Gehrig smashes a grand slam as does Cleveland's Bill
Knickerbocker. Gehrig will hit a career high 49 homers this year, 14 against

for the Browns and accounts for the only St. Louis run with an 8th-inning
homer. Ed Lopat goes all the way for the win.

The 4th place Red Sox put themselves 3 games from the top with a 7-1 win over
the visiting Yankees. Rookie Rex Cecil allows just 5 hits. Catfish Metkovich
has a HR and single to run his consecutive game hitting streak to 23 games,
tying the Red Sox record held by Del Pratt, George Burns and Ted Williams.

The Cubs score 6 runs in the last 2 frames to beat the Cardinals, 6-1. It
is Chicago's first win of the year over the league leaders. Cubs SS Len
Merullo handles 17 of 18 chances and has 12 assists, 2 short of the NL mark.

1945
Dick Fowler of the Philadelphia Athletics returns from 3 years with the
Canadian Army and pitches a no-hitter, walking 4 and beating the St. Louis
Browns, 1-0, in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. A triple by Hal Peck leads
to the winning run in the 9th. It is the Canadian Fowler's first start
since his return and his first ML shutout. The no-hitter is the first by
an Athletic since 1916. This is Fowler's only victory of the season. He is
the first Canadian to throw a major league no-hitter. The A's 24-year-old
right-hander from Toronto will compile a 66-79 record during his ten-year
tenure with the A's.

Philadelphia and the Pirates split, with Pittsburgh winning, 4-3, and losing,
14-3. Philadelphia's Jimmie Foxx hits a HR in each game, his 6th and 7th

delay plus showers in the 6th, 8th and 9th innings and hurls a no-hitter,

the NL with baserunning, Jackie Robinson is picked off base by Dave Koslo,
the 4th time the Giants pitchers have nabbed Robby.

homer in the 9th is the Bucs' only score.

At Yankee Stadium, Ellis Kinder wins his 19th game and his 9th straight as
Boston wins, 7-1. The Yanks manage just 4 hits, while Johnny Pesky and Bobby
Doerr pound homers off Ed Lopat. Pesky has hit two homers this season, both

record, and beats the Dodgers, 2-0. Alvin Dark's 2 HRs provide the runs.

The Red Sox advance to within a half-game of the 2nd place Yankees by
walloping the A's, 8-3 and 11-3. All the Boston runs in the opener are
unearned. In game 2, a 7-run 2nd inning allows Walt Masterson to coast
home as Zarilla, Stephens and Doerr all homer. Dom DiMaggio steals his 15th
... his 15 stolen bases will lead the AL, the lowest total in history.

The Tigers and White Sox finally finish a game that started in April. The
game was originally scheduled as the nitecap of a Doubleheader, April 30,
but was halted by darkness after 9 innings deadlocked at 7-7. Rescheduled
for August 10, the contest was halted in the 7th with the score 1-1. Art
Houtteman finally ends it with a 1-0 12-inning win. Hoot Evers triples and

throws to first for a DP. The Dodgers still lead the Giants by 5 1/2 games.

The Yanks hit 5 homers - 4 off the Nats' Dick Starr - to win, 7-5. Mantle's
leadoff homer on the first pitch, which starts the scoring, slams against
the bottom of the flag holder on the top of the right field stands. Vic
Raschi then wins the nitecap, 2-0, in a game called after the 6th inning
because of "darkness." Though Yankee Stadium has lights, unlike the NL,
these cannot be used on Sunday. The Yankees (88-49) remain virtually tied
with the Indians (88-51).

The Indians use three 9th-inning bunts to edge the Browns, 4-3. Hegan

the Cubs. Bob Rush and 2 relievers then combine on a 3-0 win in the nitecap
to keep the Giants 4 games ahead of the Braves. Giants rookie Bob Lennon,
who hit 64 HRs at Nashville, is 0 for 1 making his ML debut as a pinch
hitter in game 2.

1955
After losing the opener to the Cubs, 11-4, the Dodgers win the nitecap,
16-9, as pitcher Clem Labine gets his 3rd HR of the year. Labine has just
3 hits all year, but all 3 are dingers. The Dodgers' lead is now 16 1/2 games.

1956
The Hollywood Stars (PCL) sweep a pair from the LA Angels, 6-4 and 12-3,

in 1925, is ahead of Bilko.

1958
Athletics 1B Preston Ward hits 3 HRs in a row in an 8-6 win against Baltimore.

deep right field, comes off Jim Perry in the fifth inning of a 6-3 loss to
the Tribe at Cleveland Stadium.

1961
On Whitey Ford Day at the Stadium, Roger Maris hits his 56th homerun
of the season, off Mudcat Grant, in an 8-7 comeback Yankee victory over
the Indians. The Fargo native and roommate Mickey Mantle (52) now holds
the record for most single-season homeruns by a pair of teammates (108),
previously set in 1927 by another pair of Bronx Bombers, Babe Ruth (60)
and Lou Gehrig (47). New York scores 4 in the 9th to enable Luis Arroyo to
pick up his 12th relief win in a row.

1962

at Connie Mack Stadium tied at five. An error by Dick Allen leads to three
unearned runs as the Cards score five in the eleventh for a 10-5 victory.

1965
In LA, a duel between Dodger Sandy Koufax and Bob Hendley of the Cubs is
perfect until Dodger LF Lou Johnson walks in the 5th. Following a sacrifice,
Johnson steals 3B and scores on C Chris Krug's wild throw. Johnson later
gets the game's only hit, a 7th-inning double. Koufax' 4th no-hitter in 4
years is a perfect game. One hit by 2 clubs in a completed 9-inning game
is also a ML record, as is the one runner left on base. The 2 base runners
in a game is a ML record. For Chicago pitchers, it is the 2nd one-hitter
they've thrown against LA this year and lost. Ellsworth lost on May 15, 1965.

The Angels waive Lu Clinton and both the Indians and the Athletics claimed
him. Since the rule on waivers is that the team lowest in the standings gets
first dibs, Clinton join the Athletics (as noted by Merritt Clifton). He
arrives in mid-game and appears as a pinch-hitter, striking out, as
California beats the A's, 7-2. He and the Athletics then learn after the
game that Clinton has been awarded to the Indians because the Athletics'
claim was filed after the 24-hour claiming period had expired. Charlie
Finley knew this before Clinton reported to the Athletics, but manager
Haywood Sullivan, fed up with Finley's second-guessing, didn't answer the
telephone during the game, and therefore didn't find out.

1967
Sox starter Gary Peters takes a 3-0 lead into the 9th inning, but a 7-run
9th keeps Detroit tied for first place with the Twins with a 7-3 win at
Chicago. Chicago is now in 4th place, two games in back, with the Red Sox
in 3rd place just a half-game behind.

1968

the six-team AL West Division, finishing the season with a 69-93 record.

With a 3-2 win, Tom Seaver hands Chicago its 6th straight loss, giving the
Mets a sweep of 2 games. New York now trails the Cubs by one-half game.

Atlanta's Phil Niekro joins the 20-win circle for the first time with a
2-1 defeat of the Dodgers. The victory pulls the Braves into 3rd place,
1 1/2 games from the NL West lead.

1970
Bowie Kuhn hands Denny McLain his third suspension of the year, this one
is for carrying a gun, plus other unspecified charges, and ends McLain's
season with a 3-5 record.

California's Alex Johnson becomes the 3rd player in history to put one into
the CF bleachers at Comiskey when he connects in the 6th against Chicago's
Billy Wynne in a 2-1 loss in 8 innings. The Sox also win the opener, 11-4,
to break their 8 game losing streak. Bill Melton leads the 5-homer offense
with a pair and 5 RBIs.

pitcher in 48 years to win 20 in both leagues as he defeats the Red Sox,
2-1, in 10 innings. Cleveland 3B Nettles homers with one out in the 10th
off Gary Peters. The last hurler to win 20 in each league was Carl Mays,
who did it with the Yankees in 1921 and the Reds in 1924.

1973
The Rangers fire future Hall of Fame manager Whitey Herzog. The White Rat,
who compiled a 47-91 record during his six-month tenure in the Texas dugout,

Hall of Famer and beloved Phillies announcer Richie Ashburn, an excellent
contact hitter who once fouled off 14 pitches in one at-bat, passes away

major leaguer during the decade of the 1950's.

before someone in the Montreal dugout points out the problem to home plate
ump Jerry Layne.

for RBIs by a 2B.

feat also ties the 'Big Unit' with Nolan Ryan having a total of six 300
strikeout seasons.

Barry Bonds' 610th career homerun is the longest dinger ever hit in the
three-year history of Pac Bell Park. The 491-foot homer sails over fans'
heads who are waiting in a food line in the center field bleachers.

clinch the National League East for the eighth consecutive season. Atlanta

Mark DeRosa and Julio Franco.

2004
Lino Urdaneta's first major league appearance results in an unearned run
average of infinity when the Tigers rookie does not retire a batter, giving
up five hits, one walk and six earned runs. Fortunately for the right-hander,
the Mets will give him the opportunity to appear in two games in 2007, in
which he allows one run in one inning of work, to bring down his ERA to a
much more respectable 63.00.

The Royals score a team-record 26 runs on their way to a 26-5 win over
the Tigers in the 1st game of a DH. KC scores in 7 of their 9 times up,
including plating 11 runs in the 3rd. Joe Randa strokes 6 hits and scores

and Placido Polanco, leading off the game and go on to beat the Braves,

The Tribune Company, owners of the Cubs, misses the Mark with a check. Mark
Guthrie, 43, a former newspaper carrier for the Hartford Courant, which
is owned by the Tribune, receives a check meant for former pitcher Mark
Guthrie. A year ago, the Tribune's payroll department mixed the two men
up and deposited $301,000 of the baseball player's pay into the newspaper
carrier's bank account. It took five weeks for the company to detect the
error. The deliveryman noticed the money, but didn't touch it. He knew it was
a mistake, and cooperated with Tribune. But Guthrie of Connecticut stopped
the last $26,000 from being taken out of his account until the company proved
to him that he would not suffer any tax ramifications over the company's
error. Guthrie, the baseball player, didn't get picked up by the Cubs and
is now a free agent. Guthrie the newspaper carrier was also dropped by the
media conglomerate due to the lawsuit, and is presumably also a free agent.

2006
At Coors Field in Denver, Alfonso Soriano hit his 45th homerun of the season
to set the Nationals' single-season franchise record. The previous club record
was established in 2000 by Vladimir Guerrero playing for the Montreal Expos.

Brandon Webb one-hits the visiting Cardinals at Chase Field, 3-0. The
Diamondbacks' right-hander improves his record to 15-6.

2007
In the first inning at Detroit's Comerica Park, Curtis Granderson steals his
20th base of the season to become only the third major leaguer to belong
to the 20-20-20-20 club. The Tigers' center fielder joins Frank Schulte
(1911 - Cubs) and Willie Mays (1957 - Giants) as the only players to record
20 homeruns, 20 triples, 20 doubles and swipe 20 bases in a season.

The Brewers become the third team in big league history to begin a game with

contest with a bang.

2008
Derek Jeter passes the legendary Babe Ruth on the Yankees' all-time hits
list adding a first-inning single during the 7-1 victory over the Angels
in Anaheim to his career total of 2,519 hits. Lou Gehrig (2,721) is now
the only Bronx Bomber with more hits than the club's current shortstop.

Removed from the starting lineup when his cab is stuck in traffic enroute
to Fenway Park, Dan Johnson, called up today from the Triple-A minor league
Durham Bulls, pinch hits in the ninth inning with the Rays trailing 4-3,
and belts a game-tying homerun off closer Jonathan Papelbon. The homer,
which comes in his first at-bat with the team and his first pinch hit in 16
major league attempts, is believed to be the turning point of Tampa Bay's
season as its helps to snap a four-game losing streak and prevents the Red
Sox from taking over first place.

2010
Ichiro Suzuki becomes the first major leaguer with ten consecutive seasons
with 200 hits. The Mariner right-fielder extends his own record with a
fifth-inning single to center in the Mariners' 1-0 loss to Toronto at the
Rogers Centre.

The Astros became the first team in Major League history to hit six homeruns
in the first two innings of a game, against the Oakland Athletics.
