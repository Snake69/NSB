1903
In the absence of an official sanction, the presidents of the
pennant-winning clubs sign an agreement to meet in a best-of-9 series for
the championship. The Pirates clinch the pennant tomorrow.

The Cubs beat the Phils, 6-5, in the first game of a twinbill. In the
second game, Chick Fraser no-hits Chicago, 10-0. Peaches Graham, normally
a catcher, is the loser in his only major league decision, while Fraser
K's 5 and walks 4.

Mathewson relieves Dummy Taylor with the score knotted at 5-5 in the 7th. The
Giants then push across 2 runs off Jack Sutthoff and Matty wins his 29th
of the year.

Bill Dinneen wins his 20th as Boston defeats Cleveland, 7-6.

1905
Nearly fifty years before Eddie Gaedel makes his appearance, midget Jerry
Sullivan pinch hits in an Eastern League game for Buffalo. Bison manager
George Stallings, who met Sullivan, a vaudeville performer, in their Baltimore
hotel the night before, invites him out to the game against Baltimore. He even
provides a small uniform. Sullivan takes pre-game practice and coaches at 3B
for two innings, as Baltimore takes a 10-2 lead into the 9th inning. After C
Frank McManus singles for Buffalo, Sullivan goes in as a pinch hitter. Fred
Burchell's first pitch is high and his second is a lob that the diminutive
Sullivan loops for a single. Jake Gettman then singles and Burchell fires
a wild pitch advancing both runners. Frank LaPorte singles and Sullivan
scores on a crowd-pleasing head first slide. The final is 10-6 and Sullivan
ends his pro career hitting 1.000.

1906
In Boston, William Soden says, "The Boston National League club is still on
the market. We have made no changes at all in our stand on the sale of the
club. Our price is $75,000 cash. We would have made a deal with president
Pulliam of the National League had we cared to make it."

1908
Outdueling Frank Arellanes, the only Mexican-American playing in the majors,
Bob Rhoads tosses a no-hitter beating the Red Sox at Cleveland's League Park,
2-1. Four years ago, the right-hander held Boston hitless until Chick Stahl
singled with two outs in the ninth inning.

The White Sox stay close to the top when Ed Walsh tops Walter Johnson to win,
1-0. The Sox manage just 3 hits off the Senators' ace.

The largest crowd in the history of the NL - 35,000 - cheer as the Giants
shove the Pirates to 5 games off the pace by sweeping a doubleheader. Christy
Mathewson shuts out the Bucs in the first game, 7-0, for his 11th shutout
and his 33rd win. Then the Giants collect 18 hits to take the nitecap, 12-7,
as Wiltse and McGinnity combine for the win. The other hitting occurred in
the first game when Mike Donlin tired of a heckler and punched him in the
eye. Police quickly moved in.

The Reds tally 11 runs in the 4th inning to beat host Boston, 13-6, for
their only double-digit score of the year.

1909
Before 35,409, the largest paid baseball attendance ever, Chief Bender
beats Bill Donovan and the Tigers, 2-0, at Philadelphia to keep the A's in
the pennant race. The A's are 14-8 against Detroit this year, setting an AL
record for most wins against a pennant winner. Ty Cobb is the Triple Crown
winner with a .377 BA, 9 homeruns (all inside the park), and 107 RBIs. He
also will lead the AL with 216 hits, 116 runs and 296 total bases. His 76
stolen bases make him the only player ever to win a quadruple crown.

In Pittsburgh, Vic Willis stops Brooklyn on just one hit, a topped roller
in the 3rd inning by Zack Wheat. It will be the closest ever to a no-hitter
by any pitcher at Forbes Field. Pittsburgh wins, 6-0.

1911
The Giants beat Pittsburgh, 7-2, as the Giants steal 8 bases with Larry
Doyle swiping home twice, matching the ML mark. Mathewson is the winner on
a 4-hitter over Howie Camnitz, increasing the Giants lead to 5 games.

With a triple steal on, the Highlanders' Cozy Dolan singles in 3 runs in
a 9-4 loss at Detroit. The 3 RBIs are half of Cozy's season total.

1912
Despite being rained out in Cleveland, the Red Sox (97-41) clinch the pennant
when the A's lose the first game of a doubleheader with Chicago. Red Sox
president McAleer informs the Yankees that Boston will not play a rained-out
game with them.

1915
In one of the best pitched games of the year, Ernie Shore goes all the way
to give Boston a 1-0 win over Detroit in 12 innings.

1916
The Giants extend their win streak to 11 games by topping the Pirates in the
opener of two. The nitecap is called after 8 innings with the score tied 1-1.

Ernie Shore tops the White Sox, 4-3. The win, coupled with Detroit's loss,
allows the Red Sox to reclaim first place by .003. Boston will win three
in a row from Detroit.

Washington's Claude Thomas makes his first major-league start and shuts
out the A's, 1-0.

1917
For the 2nd time this month, a pitcher beats Brooklyn twice in one day, as the
Cardinals' Bill Doak wins, 2-0 and 12-4. With his 14th and 15th victories,
Doak picks up a bonus check as well. In a salary dispute in the spring,
the Cards and Doak agreed upon a bonus if the pitcher reached 15 wins,
and another bonus if he won twenty. He'll win just one more.

The Giants suspend team captain Buck Herzog for refusing to accompany the
team on its western trip. Herzog will be traded after the season.

1920
The White Sox complete a 3-game sweep of New York, beating the Yanks and
Bob Shawkey, 15-9. The Babe manages just a 9th-inning single, off Eddie
Cicotte. The Indians stay in first with a 7-5 win over Washington, despite
3 errors in one inning by rookie Joe Sewell. The White Sox trail by 1 1/2
games with New York two games back. Today's Chicago Tribune features a letter
on the front page of the sports section by businessman Fred Loomis. The
headline over the letter blares:  IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE SOX? 1919
WORLD SERIES SCANDAL REVIVED.

1922
Whitey Witt, his head bandaged from being hit by a bottle, drives in 2 in the
9th for a 3-2 New York win, and they leave St. Louis 1 1/2 in front. They
will finish one game on top, clinching the pennant on the 30th with a 3-1
win in Boston. Sisler's 41-game hit streak is stopped by New York's Joe Bush,
the same pitcher he had started the streak against on July 27th.

1924
Dazzy Vance, in his only relief appearance of the year, notches his 15th
straight win in a 7-5 victory over the Cardinals. Vance comes in for the
9th inning and pitches 4 innings, winning in the 12th on Zack Wheat's 2-run
homer. Bill Doak then gives Brooklyn a 4-2 win in the nitecap. The Robins
trail by just a half-game.

1925
At Pittsburgh, the Pirates stop the Braves, 9-7. Kiki Cuyler is 4 for 4
with a double and a triple and 2 runs to start a hit streak.

Five days after making a start in a 4-3 loss to the Browns, White Sox pitcher
Dickey Kerr loses his only decision this year, 11-6, to Washington. It's
the last decision of his brilliant but short career. Kerr (21-17 in 1920,
19-17 in 1921) turned down a Sox offer of $4,500 in 1922 and signed with a
Texas semi-pro team for $5,000. Commissioner Landis suspended Kerr, and he
didn't return to the ML till this month. Kerr was the winner of two games
in the 1919 series.

1926
At Dunn Field, the Indians win their 4th in a row, defeating the Yanks,
3-1, behind George Uhle. The win cuts the Yankees' AL lead to 2 1/2 games
over the Tribe.

1927
At Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Bombers sweep two from Chicago, winning 2-1 and
5-1. In the 2nd game win against Ted Lyons, Ruth unloads his 54th and Gehrig
connects for his 3rd grand slam of the season. A 10-year-old runs on to
the field with Ruth's homerun ball and the Babe obligingly signs it for him.

1928
The Braves and Cubs combine to ground into a NL-record 8 double plays
between them, but the Cubs win the game, 8-2 on 17 hits. Sheriff Blake is
the winner over Johnny Cooney. Cubs 2B Freddie Maguire is in the middle of
5 DPs and is 4 for 4 at-bat.

1929
A Pirates' 5-4 loss to the Braves in game 1 clinches the NL pennant for
the Cubs, losers today to the Giants, 7-3. Carl Hubbell outguns Sheriff Blake.

Washington's Bump Hadley and Lloyd Brown whitewash the Tigers, winning
2-0 and 1-0. Hadley strikes out 11 in the opener to beat Earl Whitehill,
and the Nats win the nitecap on a 9th-inning single by Joe Judge.

1930
The Yankees edge the Browns at Sportman's Park in ten innings, 7-6. New
York starter Red Ruffing helps the cause by hitting two homeruns in his
seven innings of work.

The Philadelphia Athletics clinch the AL championship for the 2nd year
in a row, defeating the White Sox, 14-10. Al Simmons contributes 4 hits,
including a HR, in the win.

a 4-3 win over Brooklyn and a sweep of the series. The Birds now lead the
NL by 2 games.

has 4 hits for the Phils, including homers #35 and #36.

1931
In a 4-3 loss to the Cardinals, the Giants' Mel Ott is beaned by Burleigh
Grimes in the 5th inning. Ott suffers a brain concussion and, with the
Cardinals clinching the pennant, he sits out the rest of the season.

Lefty Grove wins his 30th game, beating the White Sox, 3-1, on 5 hits. He
is the first to win 30 since Jim Bagby of Cleveland in 1920 and will be
the last AL hurler to do so until Denny McLain in 1968.

1932
The Athletics sweep the White Sox, 4-3 and 7-4, behind the hot hitting of Foxx
and Simmons. Foxx is 5 for 9 with 5 RBIs and a HR, and Simmons is 7 for 10.

1933
The Cards put off the Giants flag conquest, by attacking Carl Hubbell in
the 8th to win, 4-3. Tex Carleton is the winner when Leo Durocher drives
home the last run with a triple.

The 2nd-place Yankees split with the White Sox, winning 6-1, on Johnny
Allen's 2-hitter, before falling, 4-3. Les Tietje, in his ML debut, stops
the Bombers in the nitecap. Lou Gehrig clubs HRs #28 and #29. Foxx leads
the AL with 45 and has connected in every AL ballpark, the 1st American
Leaguer besides Ruth to do it. The Babe did it 11 seasons.

1934
At St. Louis, Buck Newsom of the Browns continues the unusual, losing a
no-hitter with 2 out in the 10th inning. Two walks and a single by Roy Johnson
produce the game's only earned runs as Boston wins 2-1. Bosox starter Wes
Ferrell strikes out with the bases full in the 2nd inning, and protests the
call so vehemently, umpire Kolls tosses him. Catcher Rick Ferrell continues
the protesting and he too follows his brother out of the game. The unrelated
relief battery of P Rube Walberg and C Gordie Hinkle then finishes for Boston.

Chick Hafey hits a 2-run homer in the 10th to give the Reds a 2-0 win over
New York at the Polo Grounds. Benny Frey is the complete game winner. In
game 2 of the twinbill, the Giants win, 4-2.

Schoolboy Rowe stops the Yankees, 2-0, driving in a run himself with a
single in the 5th, off Red Ruffing to stretch Detroit's AL lead to 7 1/2
games. The Tiger's other run comes on Hank Greenberg's 25th homer in the
4th. It's the 5th time this year that Rowe has beaten the Yanks.

1935
With 30,000 fans watching at Wrigley, first-place Chicago tallies 20 hits
in thrashing the Giants, 15-3. Charlie Root picks up the win. The win is
Chicago's 15th straight and drops the Giants 6 1/2 games behind the Cubs.

1936
Larry MacPhail abruptly quits as the Reds GM. He will be replaced tomorrow by
Warren Giles, head of the Rochester Red Wings and prexy of the International
League.

1937
With 3 hits, Pittsburgh OF Paul Waner establishes a 20th-century NL record
with his 8th year of 200 or more hits. Cy Blanton beats the Dodgers, 3-2. Bert
Haas has a pinch double for Brooklyn and will pinch hit a double on the
19th and 20th, establishing a NL record ... it's never been done in the AL.

The Reds hand Carl Hubbell his 9th loss in beating the Giants, 4-3. The
Giants lead by 2 1/2 over the Cubs, winners today over the Phils.

1938
Although they drop a Sunday doubleheader to the Browns, the Yankees clinch the
pennant as second-place Boston is rained out. The Browns take the lidlifter,
4-3, and in game 2 edge the Yanks, 8-7. Harland Clift has a triple and 2
homers in game 2, including a grand slam, to drive in 6 runs.

After pitching on the 16th, Pittsburgh's Russ Bauers tops the host Phillies,
1-0, on 4 hits as Paul Waner drives in the only run. The Pirates are now
3 1/2 games in front of the Cubs.

Brooklyn beats the Cubs, 4-1, in the opener of 2, with the 2nd game ending
3-3 as darkness descends. Billy Herman snags a line drive with the bases
full to keep Brooklyn from scoring. Hartnett turns down MacPhail's offer
to return to Brooklyn next Friday to replay the tie game.

1940
The A's are mired deep in the cellar, but Connie Mack hits all the right
buttons today. He sends 4 pinch batters to the plate in the 9th inning versus
Detroit, and all 4 deliver hits, with an ML-record tying 3 scoring. Hank
Greenberg matches that for Detroit with a grand slam as the two teams split
a doubleheader. Detroit wins the opener, 14-0, and the A's take the second
game, 13-6.

Cleveland tops the Senators, 3-1, in game 1 as Johnny Allen picks up the
victory Pitching on two days rest, Bob Feller wins his 26th in game 2,
2-1. Sid Hudson takes the loss. The sweep moves Cleveland to a half-game
ahead of Detroit.

The Reds clinch the NL flag, outdistancing the Dodgers and the late-rushing
Cardinals. The Reds win in Philadelphia, 4-3 in 13 innings.

1941
The Pirates, losing 5-4 in the 8th against the Dodgers, score 2 runs to win,
6-5. Hugh Casey balks in the tying run on a questionable call by George
Magerkurth, then gives up a game-winning triple to the weak-hitting SS Alf
Anderson. Durocher is tossed by Magerkurth for arguing too ferociously, and
the ump will later be verbally accosted by five Dodgers. The fivesome and The
Lip will all receive fines from the NL. Starter Freddie Fitzsimmons leaves
in the 4th after allowing 4 runs, but does not get the loss, preserving
his streak of 13 straight wins over the Pirates.

Meanwhile, the 2nd place Cards, with Musial batting cleanup, not only
lose, 4-1, to the Braves but lose slugger Johnny Mize again. Big John
tears ligaments in his right arm and will be sidelined for the rest of the
year. The Cards are still just a game out.

1943
The Cardinals clinch the NL pennant with a double win over the Cubs, 2-1
and 5-0. Max Lanier wins the opener, scattering 7 hits as Lou Klein drives
home both runs. Klein will play every inning of every game this year. Howie
Pollet, Max Lanier and Mort Cooper will rank 1-2-3 in NL ERA, and Al Brazle
at 1.53 and Harry Brecheen at 2.27 are near the same level. For hitting, the
Redbirds prime with George Kurowski, Walker Cooper and Stan Musial, who in his
2nd season hits .357 and has 220 hits, 347 total bases, 48 doubles 20 triples.

1945
The Senators score 4 in the 1st inning against Dizzy Trout, pitching for
the 6th time in 10 days, and beat the Tigers, 12-5, on a muddy field. The
2 teams tie a ML record by using 35 players. Detroit returns home 1 1/2
games ahead of the Senators.

In the Reds' doubleheader split with Boston, Hank Sauer hits 3 homers, one in
the first game and pair in game 2. The Reds lose the opener in 11 innings,
3-1, as Harrist and Wright each allow just 4 hits. Cincy 2B Kermit Wahl
makes 3 errors in the 11th, a NL record-tying effort (but the only one to
do it in extra frames). Howie Fox is the nitecap winner, 6-2.

The Cardinals give the Cubs 2 runs in the 1st on 2 hits and 2 errors, then
hold on to win, 3-2, shaving the Cubs' NL lead to 2 games over St. Louis. Red
Barrett wins his 22nd game.

1946
Brooklyn P Ralph Branca wins his 3rd game of the year, a 3-0 shutout over
the Pirates.

Washington's Sherry Robertson leads off with a homerun against Cleveland. It
is his 2nd consecutive leadoff HR, having connected yesterday in
Detroit. Robertson has 3 hits and scores 3 as the Nats win, 8-1, behind
Mickey Haefner. The mark was last accomplished by Harry Hooper in 1913.

1948
Pitching with just 2 days rest, Spahn allows just 1 hit - a Johnny Hopp
bounce single - through 8 innings in besting the Bucs' Fritz Ostermueller,
2-1. Spahn and Bob Elliott score the runs, the latter coming home on Frank
McCormick's triple. The Bucs bunch 3 hits in the 9th for a score.

Eastern League playoffs. Maury K's 18 Blue Sox.

1949
The injury-plagued Yankees receive another blow when Joe DiMaggio is stricken
with a form of pneumonia. He remains in Elysee Hotel while the Yankees win,
7-3, with Joe Page tossing the last 3 innings against Cleveland. Bauer has
a single, double and triple to pace the Yankees.

The Red Sox remain 2 1/2 behind the Yankees with an 11-5 route of the visiting
White Sox. Ellis Kinder wins his 21st and 11th straight as he is backed by
two homers (39th and 40th) and six RBIs from Ted Williams. Ted now has 153
RBIs. Vern Stephens clouts his 40th as well, giving him 150 RBIs for the year.

The Cardinals unload 18 hits in winning, 15-3, over Philadelphia and maintain
their 2 1/2 game lead over Brooklyn. Ron Northey, with a grand slam, and
Musial, with a 3-run HR, pace the attack.

1950
At Ebbets Field, Dodgers Tommy Brown hits 3 HRs in his team's losing
effort. He is the 3rd Dodger this year to clout 3 homers in one game. The
Cubs' Ron Northey hits his 3rd lifetime pinch grand slam - a ML record -
to give Chicago a 9-7 win.

Musial and Slaughter pull off a double steal with Stan scoring.

touched for 13 hits. Mays has 2 of the 3 Giants errors, but George Spencer
saves the game in his 55th appearance.

slam off the Senators' Sid Hudson in the 9th inning to ice the game,

Byrne cracks a 10th-inning pinch single to give the Browns a 3-2 victory,

Cleveland beats Boston, 6-4, as Mike Garcia wins his 20th. With the Yanks
losing to Billy Pierce and Chicago, 7-1, the Indians and Yankees are tied
for first place. This is the 10th time the 2 teams have been in a tie for
first place, surpassing the ML record of 9 set in the NL race of 1889 and
the Fed League race of 1914.

1954
With a 3-2 victory over Detroit, the Indians clinch the American League
pennant. The Tribe, who will set an American League record with 111 victories,
will be swept in the World Series by the Giants.

The Giants' Don Mueller collects his 200th hit, an inside-the-park HR,

Chicago's Billy Pierce, as New York wins, 3-2, to clinch another pennant. The
Yanks had tied it in the 9th when Berra knocked in Billy Martin. New York has
now hit 182 homers to tie the AL record set by the 1936 Yankees. Stengel
will now bench Mantle, who pulled a muscle, for four days to rest the
slugger for the Series.

Cleveland sweeps a doubleheader from Washington behind Herb Score and Mike
Garcia, 1-0 and 6-0. Tribe pitchers applied the double calamine on July 29
to the Orioles.

makes a spectacular catch to preserve the win with 2 on.

there, and adds another, both off Washington starter Tom Cheney, to pace

Aspromonte of the Colts sets an NL record for 3B with his 57th straight
errorless game.

At LA, the Aaron brothers lead the Braves to a 10-5 pounding of the Dodgers,
and cut the Dodger lead over the idle Giants to 3 1/2 games. Hank hits his

at-bats with the Dodgers.

The last ML game at the Polo Grounds draws 1,752 fans to see Philadelphia
beat New York 5-1. Jim Hickman hits the final New York HR in the historic
park, and Chris Short beats Craig Anderson. The historic stadium, which

(1962-63), first opened its doors on June 28, 1911.

1965
On Mickey Mantle Day at Yankee Stadium, 50,180 fans see Mantle play his

a barbecue grill in the shape of a prairie schooner and a six-foot Kosher
salami weighing 100 pounds. In Mantle's first at-bat, Detroit's Joe Sparma
comes off the mound to shake his hand. Mick then flies out. Detroit wins,

Larry Jackson of the Cubs beats the Mets, 4-3, for his 11th straight win
over New York.

1966
Kansas City and Washington battle with Washington winning behind Phil
Ortega, 1-0. John "Blue Moon" Odom blanks the Senators for 8 1/3 innings

set by Cleveland in 1948.

The Twins beat the Yankees, 5-3 in 10 innings, on Bob Allison's pinch

leaps off a couch and sprains his left ankle. He will not pitch until the
last game of the year.

Minnesota keeps pace by beating Kansas City, 2-0, behind Jim Katt's
6-hitter. The White Sox lose, 3-2, to the Angels when Rick Reichardt hits
a 9th-inning RBI single. Boston, Detroit and Minnesota are now tied for

by hurling a 2nd consecutive no-hitter in one park. Run-scoring hits by
Mike Shannon and Curt Flood at Candlestick down the Giants, 2-0.

along with Bill Denehy, to the Tigers in the off-season in exchange for right
hander Jerry Robertson, who will never pitch again in a major league game.

The Cubs sweep a pair from Montreal, winning 3-2 and 5-4. Fergie Jenkins wins
his 20th in game 1, helped by Billy Williams' 40th homer of the year. Phil
Regan is the victor in game 2.

1971
At Candlestick Park, San Diego's Clay Kirby allows just one hit - a wind-blown
homer in the 8th by Willie McCovey - in beating the Giants, 2-1. Despite
the loss, the Giants retain their 2-game edge over the Dodgers. The Padres
score their first run on a triple by Barton in the 3rd and a squeeze
by Enzio Hernandez, and score the winner on an unearned run in the 8th
off Perry. For Hernandez, his bunt gives him 12 RBIs: his 12 RBIs in 549
at-bats is the fewest in history by anyone with 500 at-bats. Kirby lost a
no-hitter 5 days ago when Houston's Johnny Edwards doubled in the 8th with
one out. He then lost the game, 3-2, on an unearned run in the 9th.

1973
The Brewers reach 70 wins for the first time in franchise history, besting
the Tigers. Jim Colborn goes all the way for his 19th win and Dave May hits
his 25th homerun of the year.

1974
Rick Reuschel is lifted after 3 scoreless innings and Steve Stone takes the
5-2 Cubs win over the Phillies. Jim Lonborg is the losing pitcher as Gene
Garber and Erskine Thomason combine for 4 scoreless innings. Thomason's
8-pitch one inning of work is his only ML appearance.

1975
In a 7-5 victory over Chicago at Shea Stadium, Mets slugger Dave Kingman
hit his 35th homer to set a new franchise record for round-trippers in a
season. The previous mark was set by Frank Thomas in 1962, the team's first
year in existence. Rusty Staub becomes the first Mets player in the 14-year
history of the franchise to drive in one hundred runs in a season. A two-run
blast accounts for the 'Le Grand Orange's' 100th RBI.

1976
In the first of two, the Indians top the 2nd-place Orioles 5-1. In the
nitecap, Cleveland manager Frank Robinson makes his final ML appearance
as a player when he pinch-hits in the 8th and singles against the Orioles'
Rudy May. The O's holds on to win, 3-2. The 41-year-old future Hall of Famer
ends his 21-year career with a batting average of .294 and 586 homeruns,
the fourth-best in baseball history at the time of his retirement.

Tom Seaver cuts down the Pirates for the 2nd time in 6 days, this time
winning, 6-2, at Shea. Dave Kingman belts his 35th homer and Ed Kranepool
adds another for the Mets.

The Phillies finally win, topping the host Cubs, 4-1, as Jay Johnstone leads
with 4 hits. It is the first-place Phillies' 6th win in their last 24 games.

1977
In front of a sell-out crowd of 51,798 at Memorial Stadium on 'Thanks Brooks
[Robinson] Day', Red Sox designated hitter Ted Cox goes 4 for 4 in his
major league debut tying the big league mark for most hits in a first game
along with Casey Stengel, Willie McCovey, Mack Jones and Forest Jacobs. The
performance is also the start of a historic two-game hitting streak as the
rookie designated-hitter will start tomorrow's game with two hits becoming
the only player to start his career with six consecutive hits. The Red Sox
win today, 10-4.

After losing 5 of his last 6 decisions, Chicago's Rick Reuschel notches
his 20th victory beating the Mets, 6-5. Reuschel leaves after 6 innings
because of a blister, but racks up two hits and three ribbies at the plate.

1979
Yanks manager Billy Martin reportedly pays rookie P Bob Kammeyer $100 to
hit former Yankee Cliff Johnson with a pitch in Cleveland's 16-3 rout of the
Yankees. Johnson belts two homers as does Toby Harrah and the 2 combine for
9 RBIs. The loss goes to Paul Mirabella but Kammeyer gives up all 8 Tribe
scores in the 4th inning without recording an out.

1980
Willie Wilson steals 2B and 3B in the 2nd inning of Kansas City's 5-2 win
over the Angels, giving him an AL-record 28 consecutive stolen bases without
being caught. Ron LeFlore had set the previous record in 1978.

At Milwaukee, the Twins lose, 9-8, to the Brewers, wasting Gary Ward's
hitting for the cycle.

1981
The Brewers top the Orioles, 5-1, to move into 1st place in the AL East by
1/2 game.

1984
The Tigers clinch the AL East championship with a 3-0 win over the Brewers
as starter Randy O'Neal records his first ML win. Detroit becomes the 4th
team this century to be in first place every day of the season, joining
the 1923 Giants, the 1927 Yankees and the 1955 Dodgers.

Tim Raines becomes the first player in ML history with 4 consecutive
70-stolen-base seasons by stealing 4 in Montreal's 7-4 win over St. Louis.

1985
Catcher Rich Gedman hits for the cycle and drives in 7 runs as the Red Sox
rout Toronto, 13-1.

1986
For the second time in his career, Reggie Jackson belts three homers in a
game in a 18-3 laugher over Kansas City. At the age of 40 years 4 months,
Reggie joins Musial and Ruth as the only 40+ players to accomplish the
feat. Reggie scores 4 times and has 7 RBIs

1987
In Detroit's 7-6 win over the Brewers, Darrell Evans belts his 40th homer
of the year. He is the first 40-year-old to hit 40 homers.

1988
Baltimore's Bob Milacki allows one hit over 8 innings in his ML debut and Tom
Niedenfuer pitches the 9th to complete a 2-0 one-hitter against the Tigers.

1990
In Toronto, the Red Sox beat the Jays, 6-3, to cut Toronto's lead to 2
games over Baltimore. Boston has now won 4 out of 5 in the Dome, but has
a 15-game losing streak to the Blue Jays at Fenway.

1991
In Toronto's 5-3 win over Seattle, Toronto's Rob Ducey is knocked unconscious
in a collision at the plate with Seattle C Scott Bradley. Unlike most
catchers, Bradley keeps his mask on for throws from the OF, and Ducey hits
his head on the mask.

San Diego's Tony Gwynn undergoes arthroscopic surgery to repair cartilage
damage in his left knee. Gwynn has missed 11 of the Padres' last 17 games. He
has just 4 hits in his last 27 at-bats and has fallen behind Hal Morris in
the batting race.

Despite Cal Ripken's 30th homer of the year, Baltimore loses to Boston,
7-5. With 42 doubles already, Cal is the first SS in ML history to top 30
HRs and 40 doubles in the same year.

1992
Pittsburgh's Barry Bonds hits his 30th HR of the season off Philadelphia's
Terry Mulholland in the Pirates' 5-2 win over the Phillies. Bonds thus becomes
the 5th player in history to have a pair of 30-HR 30-SB seasons. The others
include his father, Willie Mays, Howard Johnson and Ron Gant.

1993
The Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 4-3, because of a fan who runs out on the
field. With NY trailing, 3-1, with 2 outs and a man on 1st in the 9th inning,
Mike Stanley hits a fly ball to left that apparently ends the game. Umpire
Tim Welke, however, had called time when the fan bolted onto the field,
giving Stanley a second chance. He singles on the next pitch. That's followed
by a hit by Wade Boggs, a walk to Dion James, and a single by Don Mattingly
which drives home the tying and winning runs.

1995
Gary Sheffield follows up his 5 for 5 performance of yesterday with 3
hits in 3 ABs - 8 straight hits - for 7 RBIs, in Florida's 13-10 loss to
Philadelphia. Sheffield, who was on the DL, will hit 10 homers and have a
club-record 27 RBIs in September.

The owners hire NYC labor commissioner Randy Levine as their chief labor
negotiator.

1996
Boston's Roger Clemens fans 20 Detroit Tigers, without walking a single
batter, to tie his record for most strikeouts in a 9-inning game. The Rocket
holds the Tigers to 5 hits enroute to a 4-0 shutout. He first achieved the
feat a decade earlier against the Mariners.

Cincinnati OF Kevin Mitchell is suspended by the Reds for the final 13
games of the season. After receiving permission to stay behind in San
Diego on an off day, Mitchell did not show up in Pittsburgh, as expected,
yesterday or today, precipitating the suspension.

1997
In a game in which the Braves become the first franchise to clinch six
consecutive postseason berths, the team establishes a new major league
record for grand slams. In the first inning of a 10-2 rout over New York,
Ryan Klesko blasts the club's 12th bases-juiced homerun of the season
surpassing the mark set last year by both the Orioles and Mariners.

At San Francisco, Brian Johnson homers in the 12th inning to give the Giants a
6-5 win over the Dodgers and a tie for the lead in the NL West. Rod Beck gives
up 3 singles in the 10th, but K's Todd Zeile and gets Eddie Murray on a DP.

1998
Mark McGwire hits HR #64 as he leads the Cardinals to a 5-2 win over the
Brewers.

Frank Thomas notches his 100th RBI - the 8th straight year he's reached that
level - by clouting a 2-run HR in Chicago's 11-9 win over Boston. Thomas'
HR is one of 7 in the game in which 32 hits are registered. Thomas will
also rack up 110 walks this season, the 8th straight season he's carded 100+
passes. This sets the ML record.

Houston's Randy Johnson loses his no-hit bid in the 7th but improves his
NL record to 9-1, beating the Pirates, 5-2. The Big Unit allows 4 hits.

The White Sox sell C Chad Krueter to the Angels.

1999
Slammin' Sammy Sosa becomes the first player in major league history to
hit 60 homers twice. The Cub outfielder, who hit 66 homeruns last season,
blasts his milestone round-tripper off Milwaukee hurler Jason Bere.
The Brewers beat the Cubs, 7-4.

The Rangers defeat the Devil Rays, 6-1. Tampa Bay P Jimmy Morris makes
his ML debut by fanning Royce Clayton in the 8th inning. At 36, he becomes
the oldest rookie pitcher since Diomedes Olivo (age 40) with Pittsburgh in
1960. Morris was a high school baseball coach and science teacher just 4
months ago when he tried out at the urging of his team.

2000
Pitching a one-hitter against the Yankees, Indian hurler Bartolo Colon
nearly ends the longest streak in major league history of a team being held
hitless by its opponents. The Bronx Bombers have not been denied a hit in
a game since Hoyt Wilhelm did it on September 9, 1958 spanning total of
6,637 contests. The Indians defeat the Yankees, 2-0. Luis Polonia's 8th
inning single is the New Yorkers' only safety.

Behind the Guerrero brothers, Montreal beats the Marlins, 11-4. Wilton hits
a homer and Vlad hits two, including his 41st of the year.

The Braves defeat the Mets, 6-3, as Greg Maddux extends his scoreless streak
to 29 innings.

2001
The Rockies come back from a 6-0 first-inning deficit, in which they make
5 errors, and pound Curt Schilling to defeat the Diamondbacks, 10-9. The
Rocks win it on dramatic back-to-back homers by Helton and Cirillo off
Byung Hyun Kim in the bottom of the 9th. The DBacks' lead over SF is now
just 1 1/2 games.

2002
Not too fleet-of-foot Greg Colbrunn hits an improbable triple in his last turn
at-bat to complete the cycle. The Diamondback infielder had five hits which
included two two-run homers in the 10-3 victory over the Padres. Colbrum
has 4 RBIs. He is the first player to hit 2 HRs in a game while hitting
for the cycle since George Brett (May 28, 1979).

Major League Baseball teams across the nation celebrate the first annual
"Roberto Clemente Day". Each home team's recipient of the John Hancock's
Roberto Clemente Award will be recognized (the balance will be given when
the road team arrives home) and the national recipient of the award, chosen
from among the 30 club honorees, will be announced during the World Series.

2003
The Astros defeat the Rockies, 6-0. It marks the 1st time Colorado has been
shut out at home since July 5, 1999, a span of 361 games which is a ML record.

The Blue Jays hand the Tigers their 114th loss of the season, defeating
Detroit by a score of 10-6. Mike Maroth becomes the 1st pitcher in 29 years
to lose 21 games.

Major League Baseball asks players to shift about a quarter of the Expos'
home games next year from Montreal to San Juan or Monterey.

2004
For the first time in seventy years, Professional Japanese baseball players
go on strike to protest the Nippon League's threat to merge two teams. The
work action lasts for only two days as the merger proposal is withdrawn by
team owners.

The Cardinals knock off the Diamondbacks, 7-0, to lower their number to
2 games to clinch a division title. It is a costly win as starter Chris
Carpenter leaves in the 4th with an injury that will prevent him from
pitching in the post season. Reggie Sanders has a RBI and 2 steals to give
him his 4th 20-HR 20-SB season.

For the second day in a row, the Orioles score in double digits to beat the
Twins, 12-3. Rookie Daniel Cabrera (12-7) notches the win with 6 IP. Miguel
Tejada homers twice, has 5 RBIs, and leads the AL with 131 RBIs. Brian
Roberts breaks the Orioles' 103-year-old franchise record for most doubles
by a switch hitter when he connects for his 47th two-bagger ... in 1901,
John Anderson of the Milwaukee Brewers hit 46. Roberts ties Cal Ripken's
club mark of 47 doubles set in 1983.

2005
The Rangers establish a new major league record for homeruns hit at home when
David Dellucci, Alfonso Soriano and Rod Barajas all go yard as Texas beats
the Mariners, 8-6. The power surge gives the team 150 homers at Ameriquest
Field, one more than the Rockies' output at Coors Field in 1996.

2006
Having done it with the Indians and Phillies, White Sox DH Jim Thome becomes
only the second big leaguer in baseball history to hit 40 homeruns with three
different teams when he goes deep in an 8-2 loss to Detroit at U.S. Cellular
Field. Alex Rodriguez also accomplished the milestone with the Mariners,
Rangers and Yankees.

In front of an enthusiastic crowd of 46,729 at Shea Stadium, the Mets
capture the NL East title for the first time since 1988 by beating the
Marlins, 4-0. It was the team's fifth attempt to clinch the division, but
a road loss in Florida and being swept in Pittsburgh brought the champagne
celebration home to New York.

The Dodgers, who are last in the National League in homers, hit four
consecutive homeruns in an inning when Jeff Kent, J.D. Drew, Russell Martin
and Marlon Anderson all go deep in the bottom of the ninth to tie the
Padres, 9-9. The improbable feat, which had only been accomplished by the
1964 Twins, 1963 Indians and the 1961 Braves, leads to Nomar Garciaparra's
walk-off two-run homer in the tenth and sole possession of first place as
Los Angeles beats the Friars, 11-10. Marlon Anderson has five hits for LA,
including a triple and two HRs.

The Tigers clobber the White Sox, 8-2. Rookie Josh Fields hits a HR in his
1st ML at-bat for Chicago, as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning.

Despite being outhit by just 4 hits (19 to 15) the Giants are walloped at
Coors Field, 20-6. Garrett Atkins and Jeff Baker each drive in 6 runs. Atkins
has a pair of doubles and Baker a pair of homers.

2007
With the Yankees' 12-0 defeat of the Orioles at the Stadium, Mike Mussina
becomes the first American League hurler to win 10+ games in 16 consecutive
seasons. 'Moose' joins Hall of Famers Steve Carlton (18), Warren Spahn
(17), Nolan Ryan (16), Don Sutton (17), Cy Young (19), and future inductee
Greg Maddux (20) as one of only seven players in baseball history to have
victories in the double-digits over a similar span of time.

2008
Greg Maddux breaks Cy Young's major league record by geting his 13th win
for the 20th consecutive season. The Padres veteran right-hander's streak of
not issuing a base on balls for 59 2/3 innings, however, ends as 'Mad Dog'
walks Jason Bay on a full count in the third inning of a 5-3 victory over
the Pirates at PETCO Park.

2010
At Citi Field, Luis Hernandez falls to the ground in obvious pain when
he fouls a ball off his right foot, and after a lengthy discussion,
dismisses the team trainer to resume his at-bat. The Mets second baseman
hits a homerun on the next pitch he sees, but severely limps going around
the bases, reminiscent of Kirk Gibson, barely making it home due to the
broken foot that will end his season.

With two round-trippers in the Rockies' 12-2 rout of LA, Troy Tulowitzki
ties a major-league record with 14 homers in a 15-game span. The Colorado
shortstop, who has four multi-homer games in the previous ten contests,
joins sluggers Albert Belle (1995) and Barry Bonds (2001) as the third
player to accomplish the feat.

After finishing a victory short of the milestone twice during his
distinguished career, CC Sabathia becomes a 20-game winner for the first
time when the Yankees beat the Orioles, 11-3. The left-hander, who leads
both leagues in victories, is the fourth Bronx Bomber since 2000 to reach
the plateau, a list that includes Roger Clemens (2001), Andy Pettitte (2003)
and Mike Mussina (2008).

2013
In his first start in the majors, Reds' rookie Billy Hamilton gets on base
five times, going 3 for 4 with two walks, two runs scored and an RBI. The
Cincinnati speedy center fielder, who stole 155 bases in the minors last
season, becomes the first major leaguer since 1920 to steal four bases in
his first major league start.

Yadier Molina strokes his 41st double of the season in the Cardinals' 4-3
victory over Colorado, breaking the mark for two-baggers by a catcher. The
St. Louis backstop, who will finish the year with 44 doubles, surpasses the
record established in 1978 by Ted Simmons, who also played for the Redbirds.

2019
Gerrit Cole became the 18th pitcher in Major League history to notch 300
strikeouts in a season when he struck out Shin-Soo Choo of the Texas Rangers
in the sixth inning.

Bruce Bochy became the 11th manager in Major League history to record 2,000
career victories during the Giants' 11-3 victory against the Boston Red Sox.

2022
Jacob deGrom of the Mets set a new Major League record by recording his 40th
straight start with three earned runs or fewer allowed against the Pittsburgh
Pirates, breaking the record held by Jim Scott in 1913-14. deGrom's streak
was snapped on September 24 by the Oakland Athletics as deGrom gave up four
earned runs in the first inning.

The Mets tied the Major League record for most strikeouts in a nine-inning
game with 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jacob deGrom started and struck
out 13; Seth Lugo (1), Joely Rodríguez (5), and Trevor May (1) also pitched.

With his six-inning two runs allowed performance, Framber Valdez of Houston
set the Major League record for most consecutive single-season quality starts
with 25, breaking the record that was set by Jacob deGrom in 2018. The record
for most consecutive quality starts is 26 held by deGrom (2018-19) and Bob
Gibson (1967-68). The streak was stopped on September 24 by the Baltimore
Orioles as Valdez only went 5 1/3 innings giving up four earned runs.

Spencer Strider of Atlanta became the fastest pitcher in Major League history
to amass 200 strikeouts in a season. Strider accomplished this feat in 130
innings, breaking the record set by Randy Johnson in 2001 in 130 2/3 innings.
