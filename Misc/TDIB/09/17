1903
The Boston Americans clinch the AL pennant, beating Cleveland, 14-3, but
their record of scoring in 17 consecutive innings is stopped in the 7th
inning. George Winter coasts to the win today, helped by homers from Hobe
Ferriss and Jimmy Collins.

1904
More than 23,000, reputedly the largest crowd in Boston history, show up for
the showdown twinbill with the New York Highlanders. New York scores 3 runs
in each of the first 2 innings against Bill Dinneen. Jack Chesbro (35-8)
holds on for a 6-4 win, his 7th win in a row. But Cy Young tops New York,
4-2, in the nitecap, beating Ned Garvin, recently acquired from Brooklyn. The
2 teams split their three doubleheaders and at the end of the day New York
(80-50) has a half game lead over Boston (81-52).

1906
Playing as "Sullivan," Columbia University junior Eddie Collins makes his
debut at SS with the Athletics. He gets one hit off Ed Walsh and strikes
out twice, as the White Sox win, 5-4. Collins will play 25 years in the ML,
bat .333, and become a member of the Hall of Fame. Walsh strikes out 12 in
the win, while loser Rube Waddell whiffs 11 in 11 innings.

The Giants roll over the Phillies' rookie Walter Moser, 13-2 to make
Mathewson's 20th victory an easy one. Matty leaves after 7 innings with
a 10-2 lead. Mike Donlin makes his first appearance for the Giants since
breaking his leg in May, striking out in his only at-bat.

In a 7-2 loss to Boston at Detroit, pitcher George Mullin pinch hits for Ty
Cobb, and triples. This is the 3rd time that Cobb has been pinched hit for
(4-24, 5-30) this season, and each time the batter has hit safely.

1907
The Giants drop their 3rd straight in Boston, losing 6-3 at the South End
Grounds. Losing, 3-1, to Christy Mathewson, Boston makes 5 hits, including a
triple by Fred Tenney, off Matty in the 7th, and scores 5 runs. Pittsburgh's
lead in the NL is now 4 1/2 games.

1910
Detroit pitcher Ed Summers, a notoriously poor hitter, bounces 2 HRs into
the stands in a 10-3 victory over the A's. He adds a single his last time
up. The two homers, both off Harry Krause, will comprise his career total.

The White Sox combine 2 hits, 2 errors, 2 walks and a triple steal in the
1st inning to beat the visiting Red Sox, 4-3. Choinard, Collins and Payne
pull off the triple steal.

At Atlanta, Mobile and Atlanta finish their Southern Association season
by breaking the "world's time record" for a 9-inning game, completing the
match in 32 minutes. Mobile wins, 2-1. Both teams run in after each inning,
hitters run to the plate and swing at the first pitch, though there is one
walk, no strikeouts, and 4 stolen bases in the game. There are 35 assists
by the 2 teams.

1911
In St Louis, the Braves win the opener of a twinbill, 4-3, then the Cards
and Braves battle to a 0-0 tie in the nitecap. Lefty Tyler gets his first
career shutout in game 2, as does Cards Grover Lowdermilk who finishes the
year with a 0-0 record and a shutout.

off Claude Hendrix - a walk, 2 SBs and 2 RBIs in the 7-3 win over Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh rookie Carmen Hill makes his mound debut with a 5-0 win over
the Giants.

1916
George Sisler outduels the Senators' legend Walter Johnson, 1-0. It will
be Gorgeous George's last Major League pitching victory, but the former
Browns hurler will become a member of the Hall of Fame as a first baseman
in 1939. Sisler will also play 2 games as a left-handed 3B.

At Comiskey Park, Boston lefty Babe Ruth wins his 20th, beating Red Faber
and the White Sox, 6-2. A crowd of 40,000 is on hand, the largest turnout
to date in Chicago history.

1917
At Boston, the Braves whip the Pirates, 4-1. Honus Wagner makes his last
appearance of the year and is pinch hit for by Bill Wanger. Wanger strikes
out. Wagner has played sparingly since being spiked by Stengel on July
14. At the Polo Grounds on August 29, Wagner played SS, the only game of
the year at that position.

1919
The Tigers split with the host Red Sox, winning the opener, 7-6, after Cobb
and manager Hugh Jennings are tossed by umpire George Moriarty. Boston manages
just 3 hits in the nitecap, but beats former teammate Dutch Leonard, 2-1.

1920
The Tigers' Bobby Veach and the Giants' George Burns hit for the cycle,
the only time it has ever happened twice in the same day. The Giants
beat Pittsburgh in 10 innings, 4-3, as Burns adds a 2nd double to his
cycle. Detroit, behind Veach's 6 for 6, outlasts Boston, 14-13, in 12 innings,
despite a major-league record 20 Bosox batters receiving walks. Eight Tigers
walk off to set another ML record of 28 walks in an extra-inning game. Veach's
hits come off Bosox hurlers Sam Jones, Harry Harper and Ben Karr.

The first place Indians top the A's, 9-3, while the White Sox, behind
Red Faber, are again beating the Yankees, 6-4. Faber gets first-inning
help from Eddie Collins, Joe Jackson and Happy Felsch who all hit two-out
triples ... Collins and Jackson triple later as Chicago totals an AL record
6 triples. The 3rd-place Sox are 1 1/2 games back.

The Cards set a NL record by cracking out 12 consecutive hits in the 4th
and 5th innings against the Braves. Ten of the hits occur in the 4th inning
when St. Louis scores 8 runs. The last 2 outs come as Milt Stock tries to
stretch a single and Austin McHenry tries the same on a double. Both are
thrown out. In the 5th inning, Doc Lavan opens with a double and Cliff
Heathcote singles before a Redbird finally makes an out. St. Louis wins, 9-4.

1921
The Giants win their 10th in a row over the Pirates, and their 10th straight,
6-1. They will go on to finish 4 in front of the Pirates.

Spitballer Allen Sothoron runs his record to 12-4 as Cleveland beats
Washington, 8-4. Sothoron, with his 3rd AL team this year, pitches 178 innings
allowing no homers, the only post-dead-ball pitcher to accomplish that. The
Reds' Eppa Rixey almost matches him, allowing one homer in 301 innings.

1922
Browns southpaw Hub Pruett, who has fanned Ruth 9 of 10 times over the
season, is reached for a HR by the Bambino, but he still beats the Yankees,
5-1. Whitey Witt receives an ovation but the partisan crowd in CF is quick
to wave white hankies in the 8th inning for Yanks PH McMillan. Police make
them stop. George Sisler has a single to extend his streak to 41 games.

A's catcher Ralph Perkins has his 2nd consecutive game with no putouts
or assists, a ML record. Today, he catches Bob Hasty in a 4-2 loss to
Cleveland's Dan Boone. Yesterday, he caught Eddie Rommel in a 6-1 win over
Cleveland. Perkins also had no POs or assists in a 13-inning game on May 17.

1923
The Giants' George Kelly sets a ML record by homering in the 3rd, 4th and
5th against the Cubs' Vic Aldridge as New York rolls to a 13-6 win. Kelly
adds a single and a double to run his total bases to 15 for the game. Kelly
has now hit a record 6 homers off cousin Aldridge this year, a mark off
one pitcher that will be tied by Ted Williams (in 1941, off Johnny Rigney)
and Ted Kluszewski (in 1954, off Max Surkont). Kelly is the first player
to homer in 3 successive innings.

At Washington, Walter Johnson notches two wins against the Browns, winning
one game in relief, and the other as a starter. Game 1 is 5-4 in 10 innings
and game 2 is 12-2 in 7 innings.

1924
With the Senators and Yankees deadlocked at 83-59, Johnson edges the Indians,
3-2. Washington will win tomorrow to sweep the three game series.

1925
The Tigers beat Walter Johnson, handing Washington a 12-9 loss.

Behind hurlers Ted Wingfield and Paul Zahniser, the Red Sox shut out the
Browns twice, winning 2-0 and 4-0.

1926
The Cardinals regain the NL lead in a 10-1 win over the Phils. Light-hitting
Tommy Thevenow bangs his first ML homer, an inside-the-park liner off Jack
Knight. The Reds continue to nose-dive, dropping a 5-4 decision to the Giants
on Frankie Frisch's 10th-inning HR. The Reds will lose 7 of the final 9.

1927
At Pittsburgh, the relentless Pirates sweep a pair from Brooklyn, winning 2-1
and 6-0, to run their win streak to 11 games. Ray Kremer wins the nitecap,
his 3rd shutout in 4 starts, allowing just 3 hits. Lloyd Waner collects his
200th hit in the nitecap, the first ML rookie to reach that mark this century.

The Red Sox send pitcher Ted Wingfield to Nashville.

1928
Wilcy Moore, the Yankee pitching hero of 1927, goes home with an ailing
arm after working just 60 innings.

In the 9th against Chicago, Braves reliever Ray Boggs plunks 3 Cubbies,
walks 2 and tosses one wild pitch. Chicago manages to score just one run
off Boggs, but they win the away game, 15-5. Pat Malone picks up the win.

1929
In the first of two, the Cubs' Kiki Cuyler belts a grand slam, the 9th of
the year for Chicago, but the Robins win, 8-7. This is a major league record
that will be topped by the Tigers (10) in 1938. Brooklyn uses the slam in
game 2 when Babe Herman clouts one in the 8th in Brooklyn's 9-6 win. In
game 1, Brooklyn rookie Johnny Frederick hits his 51st double, breaking
the NL mark for doubles set by Paul Waner last year. He'll hit one more.

1930
Earl Averill, Cleveland OF, hits 3 HRs in succession and narrowly misses
a 4th when the umpire rules a long drive foul. The Indians take the
opener, 13-7. He hits another HR the first time up in the 2nd game of
the doubleheader, which Washington wins, 6-4. Earl tallies a since-topped
major-league record 11 RBIs for the afternoon.

The Braves' Wally Berger adds 3 HRs in a doubleheader against the Reds
enroute to a rookie record. Berger now has 37. The Braves and Reds divide
today's games, 6-3 to the Braves in game 1 and 6-4 to the Reds in game 2.

Flint Rhem, missing for 24 hours, returns to the Cardinals' hotel with
an improbable story that he was kidnapped by gamblers, taken to New
Jersey, and forced to drink bootleg whiskey. With Rhem unfit, Syl Johnson
starts. The Cards rally to win, 5-3, and take a game lead over Brooklyn
at Ebbets Field. For the 2nd straight game, Andy High hits a pinch double,
this time in the 9th to drive in 2 runs. Years later Rhem sets the record
straight, saying he went to a small party, had several drinks and woke up
the next morning in his hotel "sicker than I have been in my life." When
Branch Rickey showed up the following day with some newspapermen, Rhem was
still sick. "'Shad,' Rickey asked me. 'What's the matter with you? I guess
someone kidnapped you.'" Rhem said, "Those writers outside the door took
that little conversation and built up the story."

Hack Wilson hits his 51st and 52nd HRs, each with man on, to break Gehrig's
RBI record of 175 set in 1927. The Cubs beat the Giants, 5-2, at the Polo
Grounds.

1931
On his 34th birthday, OF Earl Webb of the Red Sox ties and then sets the
still-standing ML record for 2-base hits at 65. Earl doubles in the lidlifter,
a 9-2 win over the visiting Indians, to tie George Burns' double record at
64. Burns set his record in 1926. In game 2, a 2-1 Sox loss, Webb doubles
off Jablonowksi to set the record. He doubles tomorrow and will finish the
season with a ML-record 67. He would have had 68, but on August 4th the
league corrected a May 1st boxscore, turning what had been credited as a
double into a single.

In the first of two, the Yankees and Red Ruffing rough up the Browns and
George Blaeholder, 17-0. Bill Dickey's grand slam is the big blow. The
Yanks take the nitecap, 6-1, behind Lefty Gomez' three hitter and Babe
Ruth's 41st and 42nd homers of the year. Ruth connects for a homerun in
every park in the AL, a feat he's accomplished every year since 1919,
except 1922. No other American Leaguer has homered in every park in a season.

1933
The Giants spoil Dizzy Dean Day at Sportsman's Park 4-3, but the popular
pitcher drives home in a new Buick, given to him by St. Louis fans.

1934
The Yankees reach Detroit for a last-chance series and lose the opener,
as veteran Al Crowder beats Lefty Gomez with a 3-0 shutout.

shutout, beating St. Louis, 3-0. He's the first Red Sox rookie in twenty
years to debut with a shutout.

At Cleveland, 18-year-old Senators rookie Reese Diggs stops the Indians,
13-6. Pete Sosko leads the 21-hit Nat attack with 5 hits. Diggs allows 8
hits, including homers by Averill and P Bob Weiland to win the complete
game. It'll be Diggsy's only ML win.

1935
Dodger OF Len Koenecke, dropped by the team, and put off an American Airline
flight for drunkenness in Detroit, hires a private plane to fly him to
Buffalo, where he had played previously. During the flight he tries to take
over the controls and gets into a fight with the pilot. He dies after the
co-pilot hits him over the head with a fire extinguisher.

With Terry Moore sidelined after fracturing his foot yesterday, the Cards top
Brooklyn, 4-2, behind Jess Haines. Paul Dean saves the game in relief. In
the 2nd game of the doubleheader in St. Louis, a tired Dizzy Dean again
fails in relief, giving up 3 runs, as Brooklyn wins, 8-7. The Cards are
now trailing the Cubs by 2 1/2 games.

The Giants take a 2-1 lead against the Cubs, but when Hal Schumacher injures
his arm in the 5th inning, the Cubs jump on reliever Allyn Stout to win,
5-3. Larry French is the victor.

Phils rookie Hal Kelleher makes his first major league start, shutting out
the Reds, 1-0.

1937
Beating the Red Sox, 4-1, Cleveland's Johnny Allen wins his 12th straight
without a loss, equaling Tom Zachary's 1929 record of 12-0. Odell Hale's
3-run HR in the 7th off Bobo Newsom is the margin.

1938
Bill Lee pitches the visiting Cubs to a 4-0 win over New York, allowing 13
Giants hits in the game, one short of the record number in a shutout. Lee's
performance, his 3rd straight shutout, combined with the Cubs' 7-inning 4-2
win behind Clay Bryant in the nitecap, leaves the Cubs 2 1/2 games behind
the leading Pirates. General Lee topped the Pirates, 3-0, and the Reds,
2-0, and in between tossed 1 1/3 innings of shutout relief.

In the opener of a pair in Chicago, White Sox reserve Merv Connors hits 3
consecutive HRs and a double off A's P Jim Renninger. The White Sox win,
8-4 and 7-4. Connors will end up with eight homers for his career.

Hank Greenberg connects for his 52nd and 53rd homers, off Monte Pearson,
to lead Detroit to a 7-3 win over the Yankees. Hank is now two games ahead
of Ruth's 1927 pace.

1939
American League President Will Harridge overturns the umpires' decision to
call the September 2 Yankee-Red Sox game a forefit and orders the contest to
be replayed from the seventh inning as a 5-5 tie. After the Red Sox fans had
thrown a barrage of garbage onto the playing field at Fenway Park due to the
Yankees making deliberate outs to take advantage of the 6:30 Sunday curfew,
umpire Cal Hubbard ruled the Boston crowd's action made it impossible to
continue the game and awarded the game to the Yankees, 9-0.

The Dodgers pull within one game of the 3rd-place Cubs, taking a pair at
Wrigley Field. The yellow-dyed ball is used in the first game, as Brooklyn

pitching of Schoolboy Rowe (15-3). Rudy York hits his 29th homer.

21-game hit streak, the longest of the year. The Reds are a game away
from clinching.

1941
In Pittsburgh, the Dodgers win, 6-4, behind Curt Davis.

Before just 3,585 fans in St. Louis for a double header with the Braves,
the Cards take the opener, 6-1, behind Howie Pollet. In game 2, another
rookie makes his debut as 20-year-old Stan Musial goes 2 for 4, hitting a
2-run double off knuckler Jim Tobin. St. Louis wins, 3-2, on Estel Crabtree's
homer. Musial, who started the season in the Western Association (Class C),
will hit .426 in 12 games. 'Stan the Man' will collect a total of 3,630
hits during his 22-year Hall of Fame career, 1815 hits at home and 1815 on
the road.

1942
Pete Coscarart slaps a two-run single to give the Pirates a 3-2 win over
the slumping Dodgers. The Cardinals score 5 runs in the 9th inning to beat

1944
After homers by Vern Stephens and Don Gutteridge back Nels Potter in
St. Louis' 5-1 win in the curtain raiser, the Browns drop the nightcap.
8-2, to Chicago. Chicago works successive double steals in the 7th and
8th innings, with winner Joe Haynes swiping home in the 8th. Haynes is the
first AL pitcher in 21 years to steal home. Taking advantage of the split,
the Tigers move into 1st place.

1945
At Wrigley Field, Brooklyn's Art Herring holds the Cubs to 3 hits in stopping
the league leaders, 4-0. Ed Stevens has a 2-run double and an inside-the-park

The Cards' Howie Pollet wins his 20th, 10-2 over the Giants, despite
scattering 11 hits.

1947
Jackie Robinson is named Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News 2 weeks
before the season is over. At the year's end he will hit .297, and lead
the league in stolen bases and sacrifices. He has 14 bunt hits, and in a
game against the Cubs in June he scored from 1B on a sacrifice.

Second place Boston splits with the Browns, losing 9-4 then winning 4-0 on
Joe Dobson's 1-hitter. Judnich's single is the only hit.

1948

the 2nd-place Pirates, 6-2. For Sain, it is his 5th win of the month and
21st of the year.

The Red Sox beat the Browns, 9-3, to hang on to first place. Bobby Doerr
handles 10 chances to set a ML record of 396 consecutive chances without
an error. Doerr, who returned to the lineup 2 days ago, adds a 3-run
homer. Boston picks up a half-game on New York, losers to Detroit.

Cleveland beats the Senators, 4-1, as Feller takes over the AL lead in Ks
with 11 strikeouts.

1950
With relief help from Kinder in the 9th, Mel Parnell wins his 9th in a row
to give the Red Sox a 3-2 win over the Tigers. With the Yankees splitting
with St. Louis, Boston is now 1 1/2 games behind the league leaders, and
a half game behind 2nd place Detroit.

The A's take a 9-0 lead on Cleveland, then finally defeat the Indians,
10-9 in 11 innings, when rookie OF Jim Lemon throws to the wrong base. The
throw allows Wahl to score from 1B on Mike Guerra's single.

1951
In Chicago, ex-Dodger Gene Hermanski clouts a pinch homer off Clyde King as
the Cubs rally for a 5-3 win over Brooklyn. The Dodgers also lose Campanella,

pitch from Turk Lown. Campy will remain in a Chicago hospital when the
Dodgers leave for St. Louis. He will rejoin the team in Brooklyn Friday night.

loaded, Rizzuto squeezes home DiMaggio with the winning run. The score,
off Cleveland's Bob Lemon, gives Eddie Lopat his 20th win of the year. The
Yanks now lead Cleveland by a game and Boston by 2 1/2 games. The Bronx
Bombers will stay in front for the rest of the season.

1952
Behind Mantle's two doubles and a homer the Yanks win, 12-3, at Detroit,
for New York's 6th straight win. Mantle, hitting lefty against Bill Wight,

3-run homer by Bob Nieman, in routing the Red Sox, 10-4. Sox manager Lou

HR, his 13th since returning on August 6.

wins by a Nats pitcher since Crowder (24) and Whitehill (22) for the 1933
pennant winners.

Ernie Banks becomes the first black player for the Cubs but goes 0 for 3
and makes an error in his first ML game, as the Phillies win 16-4. Banks

2-run HR off Pedro Ramos gives Boston a 2-1 win. Muffett allows just 3
hits, including Jim Lemon's 38th HR, in a quick 1 hour 40 minute win. A
late collapse - 15 losses in the final 18 games - will drop Washington to
5th place, but that will still be the club's best finish in 7 years. The
club will continue its improvement in Minnesota.

1961
In Detroit, Roger Maris triples off Terry Fox in the 7th to put the Yanks
ahead. Detroit ties it and, then in the 12th, Maris faces Fox again with

his 58th homer of the year.

1963
Dodger ace Sandy Koufax tosses a four-hitter blanking St. Louis at Sportsman's
Park, 4-0. The southpaw's scoreless effort establishes a National League
record for shutouts thrown by lefties in a season with 11, five shy of Grover
Cleveland Alexander's major league mark set in 1916 with the Phillies. Koufax'

a 2-percentage-point lead over the idle White Sox and Orioles. Roger Maris
and Mickey Mantle each have 3 hits. Mantle's include his 2,000th career

row and will run their win streak to 11 games.

10 innings in Houston, loses to the Colt 45s, 6-5. Bunning had won 8 in a row.

1965
In front of a capacity crowd at the ballpark in the Bronx, the Yankees pay
tribute to Mickey Mantle in the first of three special days held in his
honor. Prior to appearing in his 2000th career game, 'The Mick' tells the
fans that he hoped to play another 15 years, but in reality will play his
last major league contest in 1968.

record with a 2.49 ERA before WW I ended his playing career. Hoff struck
out the first batter he ever faced - Ty Cobb.

Cleveland OF Manny Ramirez ties a major league record by hitting his 6th

so was Gus Zernial in 1951. The Indians defeat the Minnesota Twins, 9-1.

Denny Neagle pitches 6 shutout innings as the Braves win, 1-0, over
Arizona. Neagle wins his 15th and joins Millwood, Smoltz, Maddux and Glavine,

An incident that will help speed the firing of Orioles GM Wren occurs as
the Orioles travel. Cal Ripken is delayed in traffic and calls the team's
traveling secretary to assure him that he'd be arriving at the airport
within the next 10 minutes. At Wren's order, however, the plane takes
off without Cal, who arrives at the gate a few minutes later and has to
make his own travel arrangements. When Wren is fired after the season,
part of the announcement reads:  "In the opinion of management, there was
no need for such an arbitrary and inflexible decision. In the meeting,
Wren defiantly dismissed our concerns, characterized them as 'silly'
and insisted he would invoke the same takeoff order no matter what the
extenuating circumstances. The Orioles management cannot and will not
abide having a GM operate in such an unreasonable, authoritarian manner
and treat anyone this way, especially someone such as Cal who has done
so much for the Orioles and for baseball." The O's defeat the Twins, 8-3,
as Jesse Orosco preserves Mike Mussina's 15th win. For Orosco, it is his
ML-record 1,072nd appearance. He had been tied with Eckersley.

during the seventh-inning stretch of all six scheduled contests.

Marlins. Florida comes back with 8 runs of its own in its next at-bat and

was late for a scheduled workout on Sunday and got into a shouting match
with manager Joe Kerrigan after being told to go home.

Bud Smith follows up his no-hitter with a 2-1 win over the Milwaukee
Brewers. The only run in 7 innings against the Cards' budding young ace is
unearned. Jeromy Burnitz of the Brewers comes within one fielding chance of
joining Harry "Silk Stocking" Schafer (1877), Greasy Neale (1920), Casey
Stengel (1920), Bill Nicholson (1945) and Bake McBride (1978) as the only
NL right fielders to register 11 chances in a game. The major-league record
is held by Tony Armas who handled 12 chances in an AL game in 1982.

2002
Alfonso Soriano gets 5 hits, including a 2B and a HR, as the Yankees fall to

tie the ML record for consecutive years for teammates both having 100+ runs.

at Tiger Stadium, 6-0. 'Doc' will finish the season 22-7 with eight of the

2004
Connecting off a Jake Peavy third-inning slider at SBC Park, Barry Bonds
hits his 700th career homerun. The historic homer touches off a fireworks
display and the unfurling of a gigantic lighttower banner featuring
Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, the two other players to reach the milestone.
The Giants defeat the Padres, 4-1. Barry will end the season with more
homeruns than strikeouts (45 to 41), just the second player since 1959 to

native also steals his 33rd consecutive base which is an American League
single-season record.

For the first time in thirty years, the Red Sox sweep a doubleheader from

time they did it as the visiting team.

At Turner Field, Marlin infielder Dan Uggla hits his 26th homerun of the
season off Atlanta hurler Chad Paronto to break Joe Gordon's record for
most homeruns by a rookie second baseman. Gordon established the record

all 6 batters he faces in 2 innings of relief, falling 1 shy of the NL
record for consecutive strikeouts by a reliever.

2007
Marc Ecko, who made millions from his brand of clothing, announces on the
Today Show he is giving the public the opportunity to vote on the fate of
Barry Bonds' record-breaking homerun ball. The 35-year-old fashion designer,
who paid $752,467 for the ball at an online auction, has set up a website,
www.vote756.com, which gives the fans the option of voting to (1) send
the ball directly to Cooperstown, (2) branding it with an asterisk before
sending it to the Hall of Fame or (3) putting the ball on a rocket ship
and launching it into outer space.

2008
Jesse Carlson earns the victory as the Blue Jays rally from a 6-0 deficit to

victory in relief, the most by any Toronto reliever since Paul Quantrill
won 11 in 2001.

Derek Jeter becomes the all-time hits leader at Yankee Stadium, which will

history, joining Al Downing (1967), Ron Guidry (1984), A.J. Burnett (2009)
and Ivan Nova (2013) in accomplishing the feat.

2018
