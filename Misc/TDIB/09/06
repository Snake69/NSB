The National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues is formed to help
the minor leagues protect their interests.

1902
The New York Giants borrow catcher Jack Robinson from Bridgeport and
he makes his debut catching Christy Mathewson. As noted by Cliff Blau,
Robinson, in just 7 innings, lets 5 pitches get by him resulting in runner
advancement. Blau notes that the Evening Telegram and the Times, disagree
on the scoring, one giving Robinson 4 passed balls, while the other blamed
only 2. He also allows 4 stolen bases in as many tries. The last place
Giants tie the champion Pirates with a run in the 5th, but Mathewson gives
up 13 hits and allows 8 runs in the last 4 innings, for a 9-3 finale. The
game is enlivened a bit when in the 4th inning a small fire starts behind
the Giants bench but it is quickly extinguished by buckets of water handed
to the fans by the players.

Martin Glendon, reaches on an error in the 10th and comes around to score
the winning run.

but leaves the Chicago game to the players.

1904
In the first of two, Boston beats the lowly Washington Senators, 4-1,
the 16th straight victory this year for the Americans over the Nats. They
have now beaten Washington in 22 straight games (6 in 1903, 16 in 1904)
over 2 seasons. The Nats take the nitecap, 6-3, to snap the streak. The Sox
have won a ML-record 20 straight home games at Boston against Washington -
10 in 1903 and 10 in 1904.

1905
After 6th-place Detroit beats the White Sox 4 times in 2 days, Chicago
turns the tables by whitewashing the Tigers twice today. The Sox win the
opener, 2-0, behind Doc White, then Frank "Piano Mover" Smith, who threw
two one-hitters earlier in the year, tosses a 15-0 no-hitter in the 2nd
game. This is the most lopsided no-hitter in history and also the 2nd
time that the Sox have no-hit the Tigers with Jimmy "Nixey" Callahan also
accomplishing the feat in 1902. Callahan plays LF and bats cleanup in today's
gem, collecting 2 hits. The two wins today keep the Sox 4 games in back of the
leading A's. Smith will toss another no-hitter in 1908, beating the A's, 1-0.

Sheehan's 5th-inning safety. The Tribune reports that Cubs prexy Murphy
has sold a tenth interest in the team to manager Chance in appreciation
for Chance breaking a late inning tie in a game against the Reds. Chance
stole second and then stole home all the way from second base.

1907
At the Baker Bowl, the Giants sweep the Phillies, winning 6-5 and
2-0. McGinnity relieves in the opener with runners on 2nd and 3rd and no
outs in the 9th and retires the side to preserve Taylor's win. Mathewson
then beats Lew Moran in a 7-inning nitecap for his 20th win. Moran's wild
throw in the 3rd accounts for the scores.

Boston sweeps a pair from the Senators, beating Washington in game 1,
9-2, behind Cy Young's 21st and last win of the year. Game 2 is a 3-2
Boston victory.

1908

game ahead of the White Sox and 1 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis.

short of the record set by Wiltse in 1906.

1912
At the Baker Bowl, Jeff Tesreau pitches a 3-0 no-hitter over the Phils,
the first modern rookie (and third overall) to perform the feat. Eppa Rixey
takes the loss. New York wins the nitecap as well, 9-8.

In one of the more dramatic matchups in history, Walter Johnson, who had won
16 straight games before losing 2 games, takes the mound in a doubleheader
nightcap against Joe Wood, who is seeking his 14th straight win. Wood
strikes out 9 and beats the visiting Senators, 1-0, for his 30th win (Wood
will finish the season with 34 wins). Boston's lone run comes in the 6th
on back to back doubles by Tris Speaker and Duffy Lewis. Speaker's double
would normally be an easy fly out, but the ball drops into the overflow
crowd cordoned off by ropes.

2-1 to Rube Marquard. Benton gives up 14 hits in the two games. Fletcher is
the offensive star of game 1 hitting a homer and stealing 2B, 3B and home in
the 3rd. The steal of home is on the front end of a double steal with Holke.

At Philadelphia the Red Sox trim the meek Mackmen, 5-2. It is the A's 100th
loss of the season.

At Detroit, Ty Cobb's speed is too much for St. Louis and the Tigers win,
4-3. In the 10th inning, Cobb beats out a hit to short, steals 2B and
continues to 3B on a low throw. Veach then grounds sharply to Sisler at 1B,
forcing Cobb to return to 3B. But when Sisler jogs over to touch the bag,
Cobb dashes for home beating the throw.

to retain first-place in the AL by a thin margin (.623) over Chicago (.614)
and New York (.611). In the morning game, slick-fielding SS Harry Lunte,
Chapman's replacement, pulls up lame running out a single and is out of
action. OF Joey Evans takes over at short, but manager Tris Speaker will
push to buy 21-year-old minor leaguer Joe Sewell. Cleveland wins game 2 by
scoring a pair of runs in the 9th inning. RF Elmer Smith helps on defense
with an unassisted DP, the 2nd of 4 he'll pull off in his career.

Welzer. Ruth hits his 3rd of the day, number 47, in the nitecap, off Jack
Russell, but the terrier nips New York, 5-2. There will be 34 homers hit

out the Reds twice, winning 3-0 and 7-0. Flint Rhem allows 3 hits in the
opener to beat Si Johnson, then Syl Johnson wins the nitecap over Larry
Benton. The Reds are credited with a triple play in the 6th inning of game
2, going from LF Cullop to C Styles to 3B Stripp to SS Leo Durocher to 2B
Cuccinello. Cooch's last out is a hidden ball trick and since the ball is
never returned to the pitcher, a TP is recorded. It's Cooch's 3rd successful
hidden ball trick in two years, and the 2nd in which Durocher assists. It

teams combine for just 2 strikeouts in the doubleheader, a major league
record. The two also turn 13 double plays, 8 by Pittsburgh, to tie a ML
mark for a twinbill. Pittsburgh turns a record-tying 6 DPs in the lidlifter
to back Chesnes' 12th win as Kiner belts a 2-run homer, his 38th, for all
the scoring. 2B Danny Murtaugh is in 5 of the DPs in game 1 equaling the

his 5-hitter. In the 7-inning nitecap, Johnny Sain wins, 4-0. Salkeld and
McCormick bat out of turn 3 times in game 2 and not till the latter's single
in the 5th is the irregularity noticed. The umps then rule he's out of turn
and he loses his hit; Salkeld's 2 earlier hits stand. The crowd of 40,000
pushes the Braves attendance over the 1.3 million mark, a new high. Spahn
and Sain will start 11 of the next 16 games.

After 2,423 times at bat, Cubs catcher Dutch Verban finally connects for
his only major league homerun. Dutch goes deep against Johnny Vander Meer

13 innings and 3-0 in 7 innings. In the nitecap the Phils manage just one
hit in the first 6 innings but garner 10 walks off Curt Simmons. He walks 2
more batters in the 7th, and gives up 3 hits before exiting. No one in the
NL has ever walked that many in that few innings. Clint Hartung is the winner.

In the twinbill split between the Tigers and the Browns the 2 teams set
an AL mark by using 37 players in game 2, an 11-10 St. Louis win. Ted Gray
wins the opener, 8-1.

At Chicago, the struggling Indians split a Labor Day DH with the White Sox,

1953
The feuding continues, as the Dodgers beat the Giants, 6-3, but lose Carl
Furillo, the NL's leading hitter at .344, for the rest of the regular
season. Furillo is hit on the wrist by a Ruben Gomez pitch in the 2nd (with
Giants manager Leo Durocher yelling "stick it in his ear") and is restrained
from charging the mound. He goes to first base and, with a 3-2 count on the
next batter, Furillo races from 1B into the dugout to swing at Durocher,
who ordered the beaning. In the melee, a Giants player steps on Furillo's
left hand, breaking a finger. Furillo will not play again till the World
Series, but his .344 BA will lead the NL in hitting. Roy Campanella homers
in the 2nd inning and sets the ML mark for HRs by a catcher. His 38th tops
the NL high of 37 hit by Cubs C Gabby Hartnett in 1930.

The Chicago Cubs win a doubleheader from the Cincinnati Reds, by scores of

while Bruton hits an inside-the-park HR in the nightcap. The attendance of

top 2 mil. The double win moves the Braves into 2nd place ahead of Brooklyn
and just 4 behind the Giants.

Cuban OF Carlos Paula, the first black to play for the Senators, debuts with
a 2 for 4 day as the Nats win, 8-1, in the first of 2 against the A's. He's
hitless in game 2, a 3-2 win by the A's. Spook Jacobs has 3 hits and 3
steals in the nitecap. Next year, in his only full season in the majors,
Paula will be given consideration for the Rookie of the Year honors as he
leads all freshman by hitting .299.

The Yanks only split a pair with the Red Sox, but it is not for lack of trying
on Stengel's part. Casey uses a (since tied) record ten pinch hitters in
the two games, including pitcher Tommy Byrne for Phil Rizzuto. Pinch hitter
