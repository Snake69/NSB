1901
Baltimore P Joe McGinnity hurls two complete games against Milwaukee,
winning 10-0 and losing 6-1. The Brewers manage 15 hits on the afternoon
off McGinnity, who will set a 20th-century record for most hits allowed
during a season (401).

The Colts drub the Giants, 10-4, putting New York in last place. New
York will next play Pittsburgh, hosting the Pirates in three straight
doubleheaders. Pittsburgh will win all 6 games, scoring not less than
10 runs in each game. Not until the year 2000, when the Mariners lose 7
straight from August 13-20, all by 9 or more runs, will a team allow 9+
runs in 7 straight games.

Cleveland rookie Bill Cristall debuts with a 4-0 gem over Boston, a first
in the fledgling AL. Cristall allows 5 hits in the game-2 win. Teammate
Earl Moore shuts out faltering Boston on 2 hits in the opener to win, 1-0,
over Ted Lewis.

1902
In New York, Reds rookie pitcher Henry Thielman, who started the year with
the Giants, beats them, 2-1, allowing 3 hits, 2 to Bowerman. Cy Seymour
scores both runs for the Reds.

Mal Eason walks 13 and hits one batter as Boston loses, 12-5,
to Pittsburgh. The Pirates score 5 runs in the 7th on one hit. Eason's
teammates don't help much, making 8 errors, 4 by Herman Long.

1903
Cleveland P Jesse Stovall hurls an 11-inning shutout in his first ML start,
defeating Detroit, 1-0. It is the longest shutout ever in a pitching
debut. For the first time this year, Detroit is shut out without Bill
Donovan on the mound. George Mullin is the hard luck loser and will lose
his next start by the same score.

Boston (AL) beats the A's, 6-5, in 12 innings as Cy Young earns his 25th
win of the year.

On the heels of a string of rain-outs, Hudson sweeps Poughkeepsie (Class-C
Hudson River League) in the 20th century's only quadruple header, winning
by scores of 2-1, 6-4, 3-1 and 4-2. [As pointed out by several historians
including Bill Deane, there was one in 1889.] Hall of Famer Dan Brouthers
is a member of the Poughkeepsie team in 1903 through 1905.

1904
Syracuse (Eastern League) beats Scranton 3 times in a triple header.

1905
Pittsburgh's Deacon Phillippe and Chicago's Bob Wicker hook up in a 10-inning
scoreless duel, each allowing just 3 hits, before Chicago pushes across a
run to win. In the nitecap, Lefty Leifield makes his ML debut and fires a
1-0 win over Chicago in a game stopped after 6 innings.

1906
The Philadelphia Giants win the Negro Championship Cup on Labor Day in
Philadelphia before 10,000 fans, black baseball's largest crowd ever. Rube
Foster pitches them to a 3-2 victory over the Cuban X-Giants, who have John
Henry Lloyd in the lineup.

Kid Elberfeld, the hot-headed Tabasco Kid, assaults umpire Silk O'Loughlin and
is forcibly removed by police in the first game of New York's 4-3 win over the
Athletics. In the 2nd game, New York base runner Willie Keeler collides with
SS Lave Cross trying to field a ground ball, and 2 runs score. O'Loughlin sees
no interference, a call so hotly disputed by A's captain Harry Davis that,
after 8 minutes of arguing, the umpire forfeits the game to New York. For
New York, it is a ML record 5th straight doubleheader sweep in consecutive
days, and the streak puts them back atop the AL. Elberfeld will be suspended
for just 8 games for his brawl with Silk.

The White Sox drop out of first place by losing a pair to the host Cleveland
Naps, 10-3 and 4-3. The victor in the morning game is Otto Hess who gains
his first win over Chicago after 11 starts in four years. The Sox lose Lee
Tannehill in game two when he is hurt in a collision at 3B on an attempted
double steal. He is sent back to Chicago and feared lost for the season. The
P.M. game draws 13,000.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants flatten the Beaneaters twice, 4-0 and
3-2. Mathewson wins his 17th in the opener, beating a wild Jeff Pfeffer. Cy
Seymour completes the scoring with a solo homer in the 8th inning. Hooks
Wiltse, in relief of Red Ames, wins the nitecap.

At Detroit, St. Louis takes a pair from the Tigers, winning 5-2 and 5-0. In
game 2, Detroit 3B Bill Coughlin pulls off a hidden ball trick nabbing
George Stone in the first inning.

1907
The Giants and Superbas spilt a doubleheader. New York takes the opener,
2-0, behind Dummy Taylor, then Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 1-0, in 7 innings,
behind the 8-hit pitching of Jim Pastorius. The Superbas score on a single,
two walks and a wild pitch by Mathewson.

1910
Walter Johnson of Washington tops Chief Bender and the first-place Athletics,
3-1. The A's score comes on a triple steal (Hartsel, Houser, Rapp).

1913
Boston sidearmer George Tyler spins a one-hitter over the Giants to win,
2-1. The Braves reach Christy Mathewson for 8 hits and 2 runs.

1914
The Pirates take a pair from the Cardinals, winning 11-6 and 10-3. Max
Carey scores 5 runs for the Bucs in game 1.

1915
Cleveland 1B Jay Kirke swings at a wild pitch for strike 3 and reaches
1B. Cleveland beats the White Sox, who protest on the grounds that the
rules did not permit Kirke to take 1B. The protest is upheld and the game
ordered replayed.

Ernie Shore is victorious over the A's, 10-2, giving the first place Red
Sox its 6th straight win.

With the game tied at 2 apiece in the 8th, the Browns' Bert Shotton heads
a triple steal with Austin and Walker to beat the Tigers, 3-2.

1917
Trying to keep the Phils in the race, Grover Alexander does double duty,
beating Brooklyn, 6-0 and 9-3 (both complete-game victories), in a Labor Day
twinbill. Rube Marquard and Allan Russell try and stop Pete in the opener,
while Jack Coombs and George Smith pitch in the nitecap. Milt Stock lines a
homer in the opener when Zack Wheat, hampered by a sore ankle, can't reach
his drive. Dode Paskert's bases-loaded triple in the 2nd game is the big
blow. Alex will win 30 for the 3rd straight year, with a league-leading
1.86 ERA.

In a twinbill that will resonate for years, the White Sox sweep a pair -
4 wins in the last two days - from the Tigers winning, 7-5 and 11-8, while
the Yankees sweep a pair from the Red Sox. Chicago now leads the Red Sox by
6 1/2 games. Detroit takes the lead in the morning game, driving Red Faber
from the mound in the 5th, but Al Schalk's triple in the 8th seals the win
for Chicago. In the afternoon contest, Detroit again chases Faber and scores
7 runs in the 2nd and 3rd innings to take the lead, but Schalk's three-run
homer in the 4th, off James, puts Chicago in a lead they never relinquish. Ed
Cicotte takes the P.M. game with 6 innings of relief, while Lefty Williams
pitches 3 innings of hitless relief to win the A.M. game. The Sox run wild
on the bases, stealing 7 against Oscar Stanage in the opener and 5 against
Archie Yelle in the 2nd game. The Tigers total 24 hits, just two less than
the Sox, in losing two weeks from now, while staying at the Ansonia Hotel
in New York, the White Sox will collect $45 from each player as a gift for
the Tigers, allegedly as a gift for beating the Red Sox. But suspicion will
linger that some Tigers threw these two critical doubleheaders and Cobb,
though he had three hits, will be included in the accusations.

At Shibe Park, the A's host their biggest crowd in three years and celebrate
by sweeping a pair from the Senators, 7-4 and 9-2. Joe Bush, reinstated
today by Connie Mack after being suspended for two weeks, starts for the
A's but is lifted after three because of wildness. Roy Grover and Amos
Strunk have 3 hits apiece in the opener. In the 2nd game, the Mackmen jump
on Walter Johnson, knocking him off the rubber in the 3rd inning, and Jing
Johnson coasts to the win.

1919
At Wrigley Field, the Reds top Pete Alexander and the Cubs, 6-1. Dutch
Ruether is the winning pitcher for Cincy, and shows his speed by swiping
home in the 4th inning.

1920
At League Park in Cleveland, a lone bugler plays taps before the Indians'
first home game since Ray Chapman's death. Cleveland's Stan Coveleski and
Detroit's Dutch Leonard are each scoreless for 8 innings before Cobb drives
home the lone run of the game in the 9th.

With the score tied 3-3 in the 8th, Carl Mays relieves Jack Quinn for the
Yankees. New York scores 2 in the 9th to beat Boston, 5-3.

The Dodgers' Burleigh Grimes stops the Phillies on 4 hits to win, 6-0. Zack
Wheat leads the offense with 2 triples and a double as the hosts drive out
George Smith in the 7th, totaling 14 hits. For Smith, this is the first of
a ML record-tying 14 straight losses to the Dodgers.

1921
Powered by Babe Ruth's 50th homer and the pitching of Carl Mays, the Yankees
down the host Senators, 9-3.

1922
The Giants pull off a 2nd-inning triple play against the Phils. With
runners on 1B and 2B Jimmy Smith pops up and the infield fly rule is
called. Although Smith is called out, Frisch fails to catch the ball, and
the runners take off. Giants right fielder Ross Youngs picks the ball up
and the relay catches runner Cliff Lee at 3B for out #2. 3B Heinie Groh's
throw and relay catches Sam Leslie at 1B for the 3rd out. The Giants then
break a 7-7 tie in the 9th when Frankie Frisch scores from 2B on a muffed
6-3 play that Phils pitcher Jimmy Ring bobbles.

1925
After a recent incident on a train, when Cubs manager Maranville anointed
various passengers from a spittoon, Chicago relieves the Rabbit of the
burdens of managership. Chicago hastily appoints George Gibson, former
skipper of the Pirates, as manager for the remainder of the season. The
Cubs were 23-30 under Maranville, and Chicago will cut the last tie when
they waive the veteran in November.

The Cardinals score 5 runs in the 9th to break the first-place Pirates' 9-game
win streak, winning 9-3. Rogers Hornsby, the majors' leading hitter at .387,
has 3 hits including his 37th homer of the year to pace the attack. Babe
Adams, who takes over for Emil Yde in the 9th, is hammered for 4 hits and
five runs, but the loss goes to Yde. Art Reinhart is the winner.

The second-placed Giants top the Phillies, 5-4, on Billy Terry's solo homer
in the 10th inning. Starter Dutch Ulrich tees up the homer, losing to Art
Nehf who pitches the last 6+ innings.

The first place Senators continue their march toward a second straight
pennant with a 9-3 roughing up of Red Ruffing and the Red Sox. Roger
Peckinpaugh leads the way, going 3 for 4 with a triple. Alex Ferguson,
Yankee castoff, is the winner. The idle A's drop six games off the pace.

1926
In a 17-3 Giants cakewalk over the Braves, the Giants unload for a NL-record
12 runs in the 5th inning. Young Mel Ott plays 5 innings and goes 3 for
3. He also steals a base. The 17-year-old star will hit .383 in 35 games
this year. The Giants blow it open in the 5th inning, scoring 12 runs.

1927
A's ace Lefty Grove pitches his only shutout of the year, beating the host
Yankees, 1-0, on three hits. Ruth has a pair of singles in the Yankees only
shutout of the year. The Yanks still lead by 17 games.

On Hogan-Gautreau day at Boston, Doc Gautreau of the Braves is given a sedan
while Shanty is handed $1450 in cash. Gautreau then shows he doesn't need
a car to get around as he steals home twice in game 1 against Brooklyn
to tie the ML record. This feat won't be repeated until Vic Power does
it in 1958. The Braves win, 4-3, in 11 innings, swiping 7 bases in the
process. Kent Greenfield wins his own game with a run-scoring single. There
are 12 steals for the afternoon with Brooklyn taking the nitecap, 6-4.

The hot Pirates clip the Cardinals, 14-0, behind Carmen Hill's 20th win of
the year. The Waners have 5 hits, Grantham has 4, and Traynor has 3 hits
and 3 runs.

1928
The A's are set back as the Senators stop them twice, 6-1 and 5-4. Bump
Hadley wins the opener, scattering 6 hits and striking out 8. Ty Cobb makes
the last of his 4,191 hits, the 724th double of his career, as an A's pinch
hitter in the 9th inning against Hadley. In the nitecap, Garland Braxton
is the winner over George Earnshaw.

Pirates RF Adam Comorosky handles 9 putouts, tying the NL record for that
position.

a doubleheader after Chicago wins its 14th straight in the opener. Diz fans
7 to further increase his NL-leading total. The Cubs take the opener, 5-4,
in 11 innings.

Against the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx of the A's poles his 50th and 51st HRs
to become the 3rd player to reach 50 in a season, joining Babe Ruth and
Hack Wilson. Foxx' 2nd homer, in the 9th, ties the game at 4-4, and McNair
follows with a game winning HR, his 4th homer in 2 days.

1933
At Boston, Dolf Luque comes to the aid of the Giants, pitching the last
8 innings and knocking in the winning run in the 14th. The Giants shade
the Braves, 4-3, then tie, 4-4, as curfew ends the duel with two outs in
the 9th. Ben Cantwell pitches well in game 2 as all the Giants runs are
unearned. The Braves draw 40,000 today and 140,000 for the 4 games with
first-place New York, more than they drew the entire season of 1928.

Bosox pitcher Ivy Andrews allows just 4 Senator hits through 8 innings,
then a single, walk and pinch-single by Joe Bolton clips Ivy, 3-2. Monte
Weaver wins, sending the Senators 8 1/2 games in the lead.

Wes Ferrell easily gains his 11th victory as the Indians scalp the White Sox,
11-3. Ferrell hits a homer and Joe Vosmik collects 4 hits for Cleveland.

At Cincinnati, the Reds clip the Pirates, 9-3, the first loss for the Bucs
in 9 games. The Pirates now trail the Giants by 8 games. Red Lucas goes
all the way for the win, as the Reds shell rookie Ralph Birkofer. After the
game, Edd Roush's old-timers defeat Buck Herzog's Nine, 8-5, called after
5 innings on account of "tiredness." Ninety-three old timers turn out and
about half take a turn at the plate. Roush's squad includes Pat Duncan,
Larry Kopf, Bill Rariden and Rube Bressler, all stars on the Reds' 1919
team. Donie Bush and Honus Wagner are the shortstops.

At St. Louis, the Browns take game 1 from Detroit, 2-1, behind George
Blaeholder. Game 2 is called at 5-5 due to darkness. With this twinbill,
the Browns complete their home schedule, drawing a total of 88,113 fans.
The next lowest total in the AL is Boston with 268,715. The Cards draw
256,171. The last-place Browns will finish the season on the road, going 6-14.

1934
Labor Day doubleheaders define the standings for the final pennant
surge. Detroit, rained out in Chicago, holds a 5-game lead over the Yankees,
who split a pair with the A's. Gomez wins his 24th and 10th straight in
the opener, and Foxx hits his 40th HR in the 2nd.

Washington's player-manager Joe Cronin collides with Boston's Wes Ferrell
in a play at 1B. Cronin fractures a bone in his arm and is out for the
season. The Senators, last year's champs, will finish 7th.

In the NL, the Giants are rained out but move 6 games ahead of the Cardinals,
as the Deans have a double disaster in Pittsburgh. Paul loses the first game,
12-2, and Dizzy fails to hold the lead in the 2nd game and is the losing
pitcher with a final score of 6-5. The Cards drop to a tie with the Cubs.

The visiting Cubs split a pair with the Reds, winning the opener, 6-3,
in the 10th behind Lon Warneke. Benny Frey takes the loss. Cincy takes the
nightcap, 6-4, as Fish Hook Stout bests Jim Weaver.

1935
Judge Landis rules against a $1,500 fine the Reds imposed on injured Chick
Hafey, who had left the team for his home in California after asking to be
placed on the voluntary disabled list. Hafey had chronic sinus and sight
problems in addition to an injured shoulder. Landis grants Hafey's request
and places him on the list.

1936
Red Sox hurler Wes Ferrell ends Luke Appling's White Sox club-record 27-game
hitting streak.

Carl Hubbell outduels Dizzy Dean to post his 21st win, 2-1, the same score
as when the last two matched up on July 21st. It's King Carl's 11th straight
win as the Giants pull even in the series.

1937
The Tigers notch 21 assists to back Eldon Auker's 4-3 win over the visiting
White Sox. Charley Gehringer is 3 for 3 to increase his AL-best batting
average.

1938
Rudy York of the Tigers hits his 4th grand slam, tying the ML season record
as he ties into a Jack Knott pitch. The Tigers roll, 11-4, behind Tommy
Bridges. Knott was acquired in mid-season by the White Sox.

1939
With the Sunday curfew impending, and the score at 7-5 in the 8th against
the Yankees in Boston, the Yanks start making outs to get the game in while
the Red Sox start stalling. Two Yankees are walked intentionally and the
Fenway fans then litter the field with cushions and debris to help slow
things down. Umpire Cal Hubbard forfeits the game to the Yankees, but AL
President Will Harridge subsequently overrules him, fines both managers
for their tactics, and the game is ordered to be replayed.

1940
Detroit, in 3rd place behind the Indians and Yankees, gets HRs from
Gehringer, Greenberg and Campbell, to beat the visiting Indians and Bob
Feller, 7-2. Schoolboy Rowe is the winner.

1941
The Dodgers split with the Phillies and drop .004 behind the rained-out
Cards. Brooklyn wins the opener, 4-1, behind Whit Wyatt's 19th win. The Phils
win the nitecap by the same score behind Lefty Hoerst's 4-hitter. Rookie
Danny Murtaugh, brought up in mid-season, swipes 3 bases in the 2 games to
tie for the lead league with 17. His 18 will lead the NL.

Reds manager Bill McKechnie jumps on a plane at the Chicago airport thinking
he is bound for Pittsburgh. He ends up in Detroit instead. His Reds lose,
3-2, at Forbes Field.

1944
The Pirates take a pair from the Cardinals, 6-5 and 8-2, to sweep the 4-game
series from St. Louis. For the Cardinals, the 4 losses ends their phenomenal
ML record of 132 consecutive series without a sweep ... the 1903-05 New
York Giants are next with 97 straight series without a sweep, marks that
will not be matched this century. Luke Sewell and Jumbo Strincevich are
the complete game winners today, handing the Cards their first doubleheader
loss this season. Forbes Field hosts the largest Buc crowd this year - 34,927.

After losing 13 of 17 games and dropping from first place, the Browns
turn back their principal rival, the Tigers, 4-1, behind Jack Kramer. The
Browns thwart Dizzy Trout trying for his 24th win and now lead the rampaging
Yankees - winners of a pair from Washington - by just a half-game.

The Red Sox' outlook got darker today as Bobby Doerr leaves the team for
the Army following a 5-1 loss to the A's. The loss of Doerr, hitting a
league-high .325, combined with the departure last month of Tex Hughson
(18-5) and catcher Hal Wagner (.332) is critical. The Sox are in 4th place,
but just 1 1/2 games in back of the Browns, and are drawing nearly twice
the crowds as the Boston Braves.

1945
In game 1 of a Labor Day doubleheader in Chicago, Andy Pafko hits a grand
slam off Ed Heusser in the 1st inning as the Cubs beat the Reds, 7-2. Paul
Derringer is the winner over Heusser. Chicago wins the nitecap as well,
7-1, as Hy Vandenberg outpitches Vern Kennedy. Chicago is now 19-1 this
year versus the Reds, and moves 4 games in front of the 2nd place Cardinals.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

In sweeping a pair from St. Louis, Pittsburgh edges the Cardinals, 6-5,
beating starter Ted Wilks. Wilks will not lose another game until 1948 -
a total of 77 appearances, all but four in relief. Bill Salkeld has 2 of
the Bucs' 4 homers, and Frank Gustine steals home. In game 2, a 6-2 win,
Preacher Roe fans 11 while his batterymate Al Lopez catches his 1,793rd game,
a ML record for catchers. He tops Hartnett.

Tom Seats of Brooklyn wins a pair against the Braves. Seats shuts out Boston,
4-0, in the opener, and wins the nitecap, 4-3 in 10 innings, with an inning
of relief.

Before a crowd of 45,000 in Nuerenberg, Germany, the Oise Base All-Stars
beat the Third Army All-Star team, 2-1, to take a 2-1 lead in the Army World
Series. Leon Day of the Newark Black Eagles, pitches a 4-hitter for the
victory. The final two games in the series will be played in Reims, France.

1947
At Fenway Park, Tommy Henrich and Joe DiMaggio lead the way with four
hits each as the Yankees bang out a total of eighteen hits, all singles,
defeating the Red Sox, 11-2.

At Shibe Park, rookie Bill McCahan of the Philadelphia Athletics no-hits the
Washington Senators, 3-0, as Elmer Valo drives home 2 runs. 1B Ferris Fain
allows the only baserunner when his toss to McCahan on an easy grounder
in the 2nd inning goes wide. McCahan, the former Duke University star,
was the losing pitcher when Don Black threw his no-hitter July 10th. The
Senators have not suffered a no-hitter since Ernie Shore pitched his 26-out
perfect game in 1917. They did not go easily today as manager Ossie Bluege
put up three lefty pinch hitters in the 9th. The A's win snaps their 7-game
losing streak. McCahan, a WW II test pilot, whose baseball career is cut
short when he hurts his arm lifting barrels of oil in his off season job,
is the seventh player in baseball history to toss a no-hitter as a rookie.

At Fenway, the Yankees notch 18 hits, all singles, off three pitchers to stop
the Red Sox, 11-2, in game one. Bobo Newsom wins his 10th. Specs Shea, with
relief help from Joe Page, wins the nitecap, 9-6, to extend the Yankees lead
to 12 1/2 games over Boston. DiMaggio has 6 hits in the twinbill to raise
his average to .319, while Ted Williams, the AL's leading hitter is 5 for
9 to push his average to .328. Bobby Doerr hits his 16th homer in the nitecap.

The Cards gain a half-game on the first place Dodgers by trouncing the Cubs,
11-1. Ron Northey leads the offense with a pinch grand slam in the 6-run
9th inning. Red Munger pitches the first 8 innings for the win.

Ewell Blackwell hangs up his 21st win, defeating the Pirates, 13-6, before
an overflow crowd of 37,299 at Forbes Field. Blackwell K's 7 of the first 12
batters, and 12 overall, and is not scored upon till the Reds build a 7-0
lead. He allows just two hits, including Ralph Kiner's 41st homer. Eddie
Miller and Benny Zientara homer for Cincy.

1948
Jeff Heath hits a 2-run HR in the 4th inning and the Braves hold on to
beat the Phillies, 3-1. Johnny Sain allows just three hits in winning his
17th. With the Dodgers dropping a doubleheader to the Giants, 7-5 and 6-3,
the Braves move back into 1st place.

Joe Dobson allows 4 hits and outpitches young Carl Scheib to give the Red
Sox a 2-0 win over the A's.

The Yankees move a half-game in back of the Red Sox with a sweep of the
Senators, 6-2 and 5-2. Joe DiMaggio, who started the day tied with Stephens
at 118 RBIs leads the way by knocking in 7 runs. Joe has a pair of homers
in the opener, and a 3-run inside-the-park homer in the nitecap.

At Spartanburg, the host Peaches (Tri-State League) cream Ashville, 30-6. The
offense is led by 3B Len Cross who sets 4 league records going 7 for 7 with
4 homeruns, 19 total bases, 12 RBIs and 6 runs. Only one of his homeruns
is a solo shot as 9 of his 12 RBIs came on homeruns.

1949
Columbus (AA) hurler Cot Deal, acquired from Louisville earlier in the year,
pitches 20 innings against the Colonels to win, 4-3. Deal collects 4 hits
along the way.

1950
Havana (Florida International League) wins its 5th straight pennant. Miami,
managed by Pepper Martin, finishes 2nd.

1951
In a Labor Day doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, the Phils' Robin Roberts
stops New York, 6-3, in the opener. The Giants blow a 3-0 1st-inning lead
when homers by Ashburn and Swish Nicholson bring the Phils back. Dave Koslo
salvages a 2nd game, winning 3-1 over Niles Jordan. Willie Mays makes
another rookie error in the 2nd. After an apparent inside-the-park HR,
Phils 3B Tommy Brown appeals, and Mays is called out for failing to touch
3B. He is credited with a double.

At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers sweep the Braves, winning both games 7-2,
behind Carl Erskine and Clem Labine. Roy Campanella collects 6 straight
hits, including his 30th and 31st homers, before being stopped. The Dodgers'
(84-47) lead is six games over the Giants (79-54).

3-1. The A's top the Yankees in the nitecap, 3-2.

Mele's homer is one of the safeties. Saul Rogovin scatters 7 hits for the win.

Harry Byrd of the Philadelphia Athletics one-hits the Yankees, 3-0. Irv
Noren's double is the only safety. Bullpen coach Al Bender, the Chippewa
Chief, is honored before the game.

Bob Feller and Hal Newhouser square off for the last time in their careers,
but neither starter is around for the finish. The Tigers top the Indians,
11-8.

1953
South Bend Blue Sox right-hander Jean Faut tosses a perfect game beating the
Kalamazoo Lassies, 4-0, becoming the only professional pitcher in history
to accomplish the feat twice. The AAGPBL Player of the Year, who also
didn't allow a Rockford Peaches batter to reach base in a 1951 contest,
will pitch only one more game before retiring at the end of the season.

1954
At Philadelphia, Ted Williams of the Red Sox hits his 362nd HR to put him
in 5th place on the all-time list. His drive comes in the 3rd off Arnie
Portocarrero and breaks a 1-1 tie. The Sox beat the A's, 11-1.

1955
Sandy Koufax hurls his 2nd consecutive shutout, topping the Pirates, 4-0,
on 5 hits.

the second, 7-5.

In Washington, the Red Sox wallop the Senators, 16-0, in the 2nd game after
taking game one, 7-5. In the nightcap, the Sox bang out 20 safeties with
every starter getting a hit. The easy winner on his birthday is Tom Brewer
(18-7), who beat the Nats a year ago by the same score. Jim Piersall has
8 RBIs, 5 in the opener, while Lepcio adds 5 ribbies.

1957
Brave Warren Spahn's 8-0 blanking of the Cubs sets a major league record
for shutouts thrown by a lefty. The future Hall of Famer (1965) has now
held his opponents scoreless 41 times.

The Dodgers play their last game in Jersey City, as Don Drysdale loses

lead the Brewers to an 8-3 victory.

1971

9-5 victory over the Dodgers.

Pete LaCock, the son of Hollywood Squares host Peter Marshall. The
Cardinal right-hander faces one more batter to end the inning, retiring
Don Kessinger on a ground out, and never returns to a big league mound.
(In his autobiography Gibson states incorrectly that he served up the slam
to LaCock on his last pitch in the majors). Chicago beats the Cards, 11-6.

After missing 2 games because of the flu, Dodger Steve Garvey returns to
the lineup in a 13-2 loss to the Reds, launching a NL record streak of

for Jody Davis in the 17th inning. He stays in to pitch the top of the 18th
and takes a loss on a Billy Hatcher homerun.

Pitching in the 3rd inning against the Mets, Giants rookie Terry Mulholland
snags a hard grounder off Keith Hernandez but can't retrieve the ball from
the webbing of his glove. Thinking fast, Mulholland runs towards first
and tosses his mitt to 1B Bob Brenley for the out. Brenley later regrets,
"I should have flipped the glove around the infield." The Giants come up
short, losing 4-2.

1988
Dennis Eckersley sets an A's record with his 37th save of the season in
Oakland's 5-4 win over New York. Eckersley will save 45 games this season,
one shy of Dave Righetti's ML record.

1989
It is 100 degrees in Texas and the Royals and Rangers are equally hot as
7 batters get hit by pitches, the 3rd time this century this has happened,
as notes historian Joe Dittmar. The Royals put the game out of reach with

24 years ago, on September 3, 1971.

1996
Todd Stottlemyre and the Cardinals beat the Astros at Busch Stadium,

Central lead with a 12-3 win over the Astros.

1997
2B Mike Lansing's 3rd-inning HR is Montreal's only hit, but it's enough to
give the Expos a 1-0 win over the Red Sox. Aaron Sele and Tom Gordon baffle
the Expos the rest of the way, but Carlos Perez allows only 2 hits himself
in blanking Boston.

A's blue chip rookie Ben Grieve debuts with a club-record-tying 3 doubles for
5 RBIs in a 12-3 win over the Giants. Grieve had 136 ribbies in 127 minor
league games. Brad Rigby wins his first ML game, while the loss leaves the
Giants 1 1/2 games behind the Dodgers.

his 11th ML start. Smith threw a pair in the minors within a month last year.

many steals and 400 HRs.

2002
Three Ranger pitchers combine to 1-hit the Orioles, winning by a score
of 7-1. Starter Aaron Myette was ejected after throwing two pitches and
replaced by Todd Van Poppel who threw 2 hitless innings. Van Poppel was in

the longest since saves were first recorded in 1969.

Dominican Republic, then began his comeback in January.

Andy Van Hekken (1-0), with a fastball topping out in the mid-80s, becomes the
first American Leaguer to throw a complete game shutout in his debut since

stops Cleveland, 4-0. The Holland, Michigan native was 5-0 at Toledo (AAA)
before his promotion.

The Mets lose the 1st game of their doubleheader against the Marlins, 3-2,

new NL record for consecutive home losses with 15 surpassing the 1911 Braves.

2004
The Baltimore Orioles top the Yankees, 3-1, behind Rodrigo Lopez. The loss
goes to Kevin Brown who pitches 6 innings and then, frustrated on a grounder
he botched, punches a concrete wall inside the Yankees' clubhouse, breaking
two bones in his left (non-throwing) hand that will require surgery. The
pitcher, making $15.7 million, will miss the rest of the season. New York
leads in the East by 2 1/2 games.

The Marlins' three-game series with the Cubs is postponed by Hurricane
Frances.

2006
In the opener of a doubleheader at Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia's Ryan
Howard belts three homeruns to establish several new marks. The sophomore, the
23rd major leaguer to reach the milestone, becomes the first Phillies player
to hit 50 homeruns and passes Ralph Kiner, who hit 51 for the Pirates in 1947,
for the most homers hit by a second-year player in big league history. The
Phillies win game 1 today, 8-7. Atlanta rebounds to win the nitecap, 3-1.

The Marlins, who were 11-31 in late May, become the first team since 1899
to reach a .500 record after being 20 games below the mediocre mark. Their
10-3 victory over the Brewers gets the team even at 68-68, and places the
'Fish' two games behind the Padres in the wild-card standings.

The Cardinals defeat the Pirates, 6-3, as Albert Pujols hits 3 homers for
St. Louis. It is his second three-homer game this year.

Huff's 2nd inning single is Houston's lone safety. Roy Oswalt hurls 7
perfect innings for the Astros.

2007
Making his first start of the season, Mets right hander Pedro Martinez
whiffs Reds hurler Aaron Harang to become the 15th major league pitcher to
record 3,000 career strike outs. The three-time Cy Young winner has missed
most of the season recovering from rotator cuff surgery.

With a homerun against Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, Ichiro collects his
200th hit for the season for the seventh consecutive year. The Mariner
outfielder joins Wee Willie Keeler (Orioles and Brooklyn Grooms/Supbras,
1894-1901) and Wade Boggs (Red Sox, 1983-1989) as only the third player to
accomplish the feat, and will tie Keeler's record of eight staight seasons
if he reaches the milestone next year.

2008
Yankee Alex Rodriguez' towering fly ball, which bounces off the Tropicana
Field catwalk behind the foul pole in left field, is immediately ruled a
homerun by Brian Runge. The third base umpire's decision, which is disputed
by Rays catcher Dioner Navarro, proves to be correct as the men in blue
take 2 minutes 15 seconds to review the video becoming the first crew to
use the new instant-replay system since its implementation last week.

Although the official attendance, which is based on tickets sold, is 11,211,
fewer than 600 fans actually attend the Marlins game at Miami's Dolphin
Stadium. The Fish, who had been in contention for most of the season,
beat the Braves on the hot and humid Florida afternoon, 5-3.

2009
Pedro Martinez, tossing seven innings of one-hit ball at Citizens Bank Park
in the Phillies' 2-1 victory over the Giants, becomes just the tenth pitcher
in major league history to win 100 games in both leagues. The right-hander
compiled a 117-37 record pitching for Boston during his seven year stint
in the American League.

After starting 13 games with two different clubs, Pat Misch's team finally
wins a game he starts when the Mets beat the Rockies, 8-3. The former Giants
starter, who earned the Coors Field victory for New York, had tied a dubious
mark established over the 1993-94 seasons by Seattle's John Cummings for the
longest winless streak endured by a team with the same starter on the mound.

2010
Major League Baseball penalizes six players, both skippers and a coach
following an ugly brawl between the Nationals and Marlins two days ago in
Miami that was a result of Chris Volstad throwing at Nyjer Morgan for the
second time in the game. The Florida outfielder, who became a target when
he ran over Brett Hayes separating the catcher's shoulder in yesterday's
contest, retaliated to being hit in the fourth by stealing two bases,
but charges the mound after the sixth inning incident setting off the melee.

Stephen Strasburg undergoes reconstructive elbow surgery in which Dr. Lewis
Yocum takes a piece of ligament from the 22-year-old right-hander's left
leg and transplants it into the rookie's pitching elbow. The 'Tommy John'
surgery might keep the Nationals' much-heralded phenom out of the starting
rotation until the start of the 2012 season.

2011
Needing a two-bagger to become the first major leaguer to hit for
the cycle this season, George Kottaras strokes an apparent triple, but
accomplishes the feat when the ball bounces off of Tal's Hill, a 20 degree
angled incline located in centerfield, over the fence for an unexpected
ground-rule double. The Brewers backstop also hit a solo homer in the fourth,
a sixth-inning triple, and singled in the seventh in Milwaukee's 8-4 victory
over Houston at Minute Maid park.

2012
The Nationals win their 82nd game when they beat Chicago at home, 2-1,
assuring the team of their first winning season since leaving Montreal to
play in Washington. The transplanted team finished at exactly .500 after
their first year in the nation's capital, posting an 81-81 record in 2005.

2013
Max Scherzer's opportunity to become the second hurler to start a season
with a 20-1 record is dashed when Jon Lester and the Red Sox beat the
Tigers at Fenway Park, 2-1. In 2001, Yankees right-hander Roger Clemens,
who would finish 20-3, became only pitcher to open a campaign 20-1.

The Pirates ensure their first non-losing campaign since 1992, when the
team beats Milwaukee at Miller Park, 4-3. Travis Snider's ninth-inning
pinch-hit homerun bring the Bucs their 81st victory this season, a total
the team hadn't reached in 21 years.

2014
In the Red Sox' 9-4 victory at Yankee Stadium, Xander Bogaerts and Mookie
Betts become the first pair of Boston rookies to hit a homerun in the same
game at the Bronx ballpark in 62 years. In 1952, Dick Gernert and Faye
Throneberry also accomplished the feat, providing the difference in the
team's 3-1 win over the Bombers.

2015
Oakland's 20-game winning streak is stopped when the Twins and Brad Radke,
who throws a six-hitter, blanks the team at the Metrodome, 6-0. The A's
fell one game short of equalling the second-longest modern winning streak
in baseball history established by the Cubs, who won 21 straight contests
in 1935.

2017
Jose Ramirez of the Indiana hit three doubles and two homeruns against the
Tigers. He became the 13th player to have five extra-base hits in a game.

2018
With his first-inning strikeout of Matt Carpenter of the St. Louis
Cardinals, Max Scherzer recorded his fifth consecutive season of at least
250 strikeouts. He becomes the second pitcher in Major League history to
accomplish this feat. He joins Randy Johnson who accomplished this in six
consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2002.
