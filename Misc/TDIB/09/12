1901
Baltimore's Joe McGinnity hurls 2 more complete games, winning over
Philadelphia, 4-3, and losing, 5-4. The A's reach McGinnity for 10 hits in
the nitecap.

1903
In St. Louis, Roger Bresnahan's 10th-inning sacrifice fly scores Jack Warner
with the game winner as New York wins, 4-3. Despite giving up 12 hits,
Mathewson is the winner over Jim Hackett.

Boston Tom Hughes defeats the Highlanders, 10-1, for his 20th win of the year.

1904
Boston wins its 2nd of 19 games against the Giants, and top Christy Mathewson
in the process, 3-1.

1905
Cards pitcher Jack Taylor allows just three Pirate hits - all by Honus
Wagner - and teammate Harry Arndt swipes home in the bottom of the 9th
to give St. Louis a 2-1 victory. Wagner will spoil two more no-hitters by
collecting the only hits:  against Art Fromme on May 27, 1911 and facing
Phil Douglas on October 2, 1914.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Brooklyn split a twinbill. Mathewson
wins the opener, 3-2, when Bill Dahlen singles home the winner in the
9th. The 2nd game is called after 7 innings with Brooklyn leading, 8-5.

1906
The White Sox drub the Browns, 13-5, to move to a game behind the Highlanders
in the AL. Chicago scores 9 runs in the 2nd inning. Tomorrow's match ends
at 0-0 in 10 innings.

In the Washington-Philadelphia game, A's P Mike Cunningham is injured
in a collision at 1B in the 4th inning. The injury is to his left, or
non-pitching shoulder, and a courtesy runner comes in for him. Cunningham
returns to finish the game, a 5-1 A's victory.

1907
Boston loses to the Athletics, 7-1, and though they'll tie 6-6 tomorrow it
is the start of a 16-game losing streak. Tris Speaker makes his ML debut
going 0 for 2 against spitballer Jimmy Dygert. (TB erroneously has Speaker's
debut date as 9/14.)

In a 2-0 win against the Yankees at Hilltop Park, Washington's Walter Johnson
strikes out 5 batters, though it'll be recorded as 4 K's. Researcher John
Schwartz, in the 1990s, will find the extra K, resulting in Johnson's
lifetime total of 3,509. The issue crops up again on Opening Day, 2001,
when Clemens ties (or beats) the mark.

1908
In the dogfight for the AL pennant, the White Sox play their 4th straight
extra-inning game at Detroit, a total of 43 innings. The White Sox win
their 2nd straight, while the Browns lose their 2nd in a row to Cleveland.

A day after beating the A's Eddie Plank, 2-1, Washington's Walter
Johnson is forced to start again, this time replacing sore-armed Charley
Smith. Remarkably, Johnson records his 5th complete game victory in 9 days.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1910
At Toronto, Dick Rudolph of Toronto (Eastern League) pitches 10 hitless
innings over Montreal. Rudolph wins in 12 innings, 2-1.

At Oakland, Vean Gregg of Portland pitches a PCL-record third 1-hitter,
a 2-0 win over Oakland.

1911
In the nitecap of a game billed as a pitchers' duel, Boston's Cy Young
and the Giants' Christy Mathewson face each other before 10,000, Boston's
largest crowd of the year. Young gives up 3 homers and 9 runs in less than
3 innings. After the Giants build a 9-0 lead, John McGraw lifts Mathewson,
who pitched just 2 innings, preferring to save his ace for the pennant race
against Chicago and Philadelphia. This is the only time the 2 pitchers ever
face each other. Mathewson adds to New York's scoring in the 3rd by swiping
home. The Giants coast, 11-2. In the field, Matty also helps when, with Miller
on 1B in the 2nd inning, a line drive to center by Gowdy results in a DP
(8-4-1-3). New York wins the 1st game, 9-3, and now lead the Cubs by 2 games.

1912
Cleveland sweeps a doubleheader with league-leading Boston, taking just
11 total innings to win. The first game is called after five innings with
the Naps ahead, 9-3. The rain stops and the umps decide to start the second
game. After six innings, with Cleveland leading 6-0, the nitecap is called
on account of darkness.

The leading Giants split with the Cardinals, losing the opener when the
Birds blast reliever Doc Crandall in the 9th to win, 4-2. Jeff Tesreau wins
his 6th straight in the nitecap.

1914
Yankee SS Roger Peckinpaugh, 23, is named to replace Frank Chance, who
resigns today effective through September 15. Peckinpaugh becomes the all-time
youngest manager, and the 7th in the club's 12-year existence. He will win 9
of 17 games and will manage next at Cleveland in 1928. The Yanks win today,
2-1, over the A's, with catcher Jeff "Big Ed" Sweeney going from goat to
hero. When McInnis and Strunk attempt a double steal in the top of the 9th,
Sweeney heaves the ball into CF trying to throw to 2B and McInnis scores
the tying run. Leading off in the bottom of the 9th against Chief Bender,
Sweeney cracks a homerun, his only one of the year, to give New York the
win. Winning pitcher Ray Keating is warned by umpire Tommy Connally, who
discovers an emery board on the pitcher. In ten days the emery pitch will be
banned and any violation will result in a $100 fine and a 30-day suspension.

In Philadelphia, Grover Cleveland Alexander receives an automobile before
the first game of a doubleheader as the Phillies' most popular player,
then drives by the Giants' Rube Marquard for a 1-0 win. It is his 23rd of
the year tying him with Mathewson for the NL lead. Alex gives up 4 hits as
Marquard absorbs his 10th straight loss. Art Fromme wins the second game,
6-0, in 1 hour 38 minutes. Game 1 took just 1 hour 12 minutes.

St. Louis Federal Leaguer Bob Groom accomplishes the rare feat of umpiring
and pitching in the same game. When the two regular umps don't appear,
Groom and Bert Maxwell of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops are selected to ump. The
regular umps appear in the 3rd inning, having thought the game started at
3:30, not 2:30. Groom goes to the bench but relieves in the 7th inning and
allows 3 hits in the Brookfeds' 4-run inning. Brooklyn wins, 8-5.

1915
Dave Danforth of Lousville (AA), strikes out 18 Kansas City batters to set
an American Assocation record. In his next start, on May 15, he will strike
out 15 St. Paul hitters. He'll whiff 130 in 101 innings.

1916
Walter Johnson and Babe Ruth, both pitching on 2 days rest, square
off. Washington scores 2 runs in the 9th when John Henry lines a bases-loaded
double off Ruth to tie the game, 2-2. Boston scores in the 10th, but
Washington tallies twice off Ernie Shore to win, 4-3. Johnson is the winner.

Dick Rudolph of the Braves win his 4th 1-0 game in six weeks beating the
Cubs, 1-0, in game 1. Game 2 ends in a 3-3 tie.

1919
At Chicago, the Cubs and Dodgers break even, with the Cubs winning the opener,
3-1, and the visitors taking game 2, 5-4. A triple play by SS Bill Hollocher
to 1B Fred Merkle on a line drive by Ed Konetchy is the highlite of game 1.

1920
The Indians beat the A's, 5-2, as Duster Mails wins his 3rd straight game.

In Detroit, an overflow crowd of 29,000 boo Carl Mays as Detroit roughs up
the Yankee submariner for a 4-0 lead to knock him out of the box. But the
Yankees rally on 5 ground-rule doubles into the crowd, and HRs by Wally
Pipp and Duffy Lewis to win, 13-6.

The White Sox lose, 5-0, to Washington and fall 1 1/2 games off the pace.

Flint's Frank Wetzel (Michigan-Ontario League) finishes the season going
22 for 23. His hits include 8 doubles, 7 triples and 2 homers. The streak
began with a doubleheader on September 6. Wetzel raises his average from
.354 to .387 to lead the league.

1924
Chicago's Hack Miller hits a pinch homerun in the 8th to tie the game with
the Phils at 6 apiece. The Cubs go on to win, 10-8.

1925
In Detroit's game 1 loss to Cleveland, 3-1 in 13 innings, Detroit's John
Tavener hits a ML-record tying 3 triples. Benn Karr goes the distance for
the win. Detroit then takes the nitecap, 3-2.

1929
In Cincinnati, the Reds use a freak homerun by Hod Ford to beat Brooklyn,
3-2. Rixey is the winner over Vance. With Sukeforth on 1B, Ford's long fly
in the 4th inning eludes Babe Herman, who stumbles and then tumbles into
the RF seats. The ball bounds away and both runners score.

1930
Brooklyn C Al Lopez drives one over the head of Cincinnati LF Bob Meusel,
and the ball bounces into the bleachers at Ebbets Field. It will be the
ML's last recorded bounce HR, as the NL rules after the season that such
a hit will henceforth be a double. The AL had made the change after the
1929 season. Brooklyn wins, 7-3, for their 8th straight win; the Reds go
the other way recording their 8th straight loss.

The Cubs' offense finally comes to life as Chicago feasts on Philley pitching
to win, 17-4. Wilson has a HR, two doubles and a pair of singles in the game.

1931
At Boston, Eddie Durham and Detroit's Arthur "Red" Herring hook up in a
13-inning pitching duel won by the Sox pitcher, 1-0.

1932

record-setting sixth pinch-homer of the season giving the Dodgers a 4-3
victory over the Cubs.

Washington's General Crowder whips Chicago, 9-3, for his 8th win against
the White Sox this year. This sets the ML record for wins against one team
in a season. Tex Carleton will win 8 against Boston in 4 years in the NL,
but no one this century will win 9.

The New York Yankees clinch the AL pennant with their 100th victory as
George Pipgras defeats the Indians, 9-3, at Cleveland. It is the Yankees'
200th straight game without being shut out.

1933
The Dodgers are zero for the afternoon against the Pirates, as Heine Meine
tops them, 1-0, in the opener and Waite Hoyt wins the nitecap, 2-0.

1934
The 7th-place Phils top the Cardinals, 3-1, when Dizzy Dean, in relief of
Dazzy Vance, fails to stop the Phillies from scoring all their runs in the
8th. The Cards' only scoring is Dazzy's HR.

Cincinnati introduces rookie P Junie Barnes, who walks the only batter he
faces to give the Dodgers an 8-7 win over the visiting Reds. Barnes will
make one more appearance, again facing one batter and also finishing that
game, and his career.

Carl Hubbell wins his 20th, a 3-2 victory over Pittsburgh. With the Cards
now 5 1/2 games behind, the New York Times reports the Giants' win, "put
the finishing touches to reinforcing their position until it was generally
accepted as practically impregnable."

1935
Charlie Grimm's Cubs continue their hot hitting, trouncing the Dodgers,
13-3. Augie Galan has 4 hits and 5 RBIs for the 'Grimm Reapers.'

Dizzy Dean wins his 26th, a 5-2 CG victory over New York's Carl Hubbell,
to keep the Cardinals in 1st place by a game. But the Cards' Ducky Medwick
has his hitting streak stopped at 28 straight games.

1936
Kid Elberfeld pinch-hits at age 61 for his Fulton (Kitty League) team and
grounds out to 3B.

1937
At the Stadium, the Yankees split with the Senators, losing game 1, by a
2-1 score to rookie Ken Chase. Lefty Gomez wins game 2 by the same score
as DiMaggio poles his 42nd HR.

The Phils edge the Dodgers, 2-1, behind Wayne LeMaster's 10-inning
masterpiece. Eddie Wilson's grand slam gives Brooklyn the nitecap, 9-5. Dodger
manager Burleigh Grimes is thumbed out of game 2 for the 9th time this season.

1939
Trailing 2-0 to the visiting Dodgers, the Reds score 2 runs in the 9th on
a 2-out HR by Billy Myers off Hot Potato Hamlin. Frank McCormick's single
in the 10th drives in the winning run.

1940
Hank Greenberg hits his 32nd homer to lead Detroit to a victory, 6-3,
over visiting New York.

The Boston Bees sting the Cardinals twice, winning 17-7 and 6-1. Pitcher
Jim Tobin wins the opener and helps out by scoring 4 runs, the last NL
hurler this century to do so.

1941
The Cards take a 2-0 lead over Brooklyn and hold on to win, 4-3. Estel
Crabtree, filling in for the injured Slaughter, triples and scores the winning
run and also makes a perfect throw to cut down a run at the plate. Rookie
Howie Pollet and lefty Max Lanier combine to beat Curt Davis.

1942
Brooklyn fandom's worst fears are realized as the Cardinals again beat the
Dodgers, 2-1. The win by Max Lanier leaves both teams tied for 1st at 94-46.

1943
Bob Elliott's 8th-inning double is the Pirates' only hit, as the Reds'
Elmer Riddle stops them, 1-0, in the first of two. The Pirates come back to
shut out the Reds, 7-0, behind the pitching of Xavier Rescigno. Jim Russell
hits a 3-run homer.

At Fenway, the New York Yankees sweep a pair from the Red Sox to sweep
the five-game series and finish at 17-5 against the Sox for the year. The
Yanks won't sweep another 5-gamer in Boston until 2006. Ernie Bonham wins
the opener, 1-0, and drives in the lone run off Joe Dobson with a single in
the 8th. In game 2, the Sox blow a 5-1 lead as Billy Johnson hits a 2-run
homer to spark the Yankees' comeback. Atley Donald allows one hit over the
last 5 innings.

1946
The Dodgers, a game and a half out despite winning 9 of their last 10, host
St. Louis for a three game series. But the Cardinals rip Brooklyn, 10-2,
behind Howie Pollet's 5-hitter, in the series opener. The Cards light up
Kirby Higbe in the first inning for 5 runs, highlighted by Joe Garagiola's
3-run homer.

1947
Ralph Kiner hits his record 8th HR in 4 games to pass Johnny Mize in the HR
race as Pittsburgh tops the Boston Braves, 4-3. The rain of HRs exceeds the
7 in 4 games hit by Tony Lazzeri in 1936. Kiner has now hit 20 homeruns in
the past 30 days - from August 14 through today - to set a record (Maris will
tie the mark in 1961 and Sosa will top it in 1998). On the 18th Kiner will
again pass Mize in the homer derby by belting his 50th of the season. Mize
will get his 50th two days later. Kiner will get number 51 on September
23 against Jim Hearn of the Cards, and Mize will tie it up 2 days later
off Johnny Sain of Boston. Both players have until the season finales on
September 28 to break the tie, but neither will succeed.

The Cards bounce back to defeat the Dodgers, 8-7, with 13 of the runs
counted in the last 3 frames. The Flatbushers score 4 in the 9th, 2 on
rookie Lund's 1st ML homer, but the Cards answer with 2 to win.

1948
The Phils almost derail the Braves' express, stopping the league leaders,
6-4, in the first of two, then succumbing, 2-1 in 13 innings, in the
nitecap. The Braves make 14 hits in the opener off Dutch Leonard, but the
Phils total 13 hits, including Del Ennis' 26th homer. Both teams score
a run in the 3rd of the nitecap, but the Braves tally one in the 13th to
win. Al Dark opens with a single, and races to 3B on Earl Torgeson's sac
bunt. Two intentional walks loads the bases, and Bill Salkeld's sac fly
brings Dark home. Del Ennis opens the Phils' 10th with a triple, but Nels
Potter relieves Bickford and intentionally passes two before striking out
Miller and Seminick. Don Padgett then grounds out.

The second-place Pirates creep to within 3 games of the Braves by jolting
the Cubs, 7-3. 40-year-old Rip Sewell (11-3) continues his mastery of
the Bruins beating them for the 7th time this year and the 33rd of his
career. Cubs pitchers help by handing out 14 walks.

At Fenway, the A's score 6 runs in the 9th to defeat the first-place Red
Sox, 10-4. Carl Scheib, 21, is the winner over Joe Dobson, notching his
13th win. The A's are the only team so far this year with four pitchers
with 13 or more wins.

The Indians stretch their winning streak to seven games as Sam Zoldak wins
his 3rd in five days. The Tribe beat the Browns, 6-4, then settle for a 3-3
thirteen-inning tie. Karl Drews walks 8 in less than 4 innings to take the
loss for the Browns. The Browns chase Satchel Paige in the 5th, but Zoldak
nails down the win. Cleveland is in 3rd place 2 1/2 games behind New York
and Boston.

1950
The Yankees blow a 6-run lead as Cleveland scores 4 in the 9th inning off
Allie Reynolds to win, 8-7. Luke Easter's 3-run HR - his 2nd of the game
- is the big blow, as the Yankees skid to 2nd place, a half game behind
Detroit and a half game ahead of Boston.

Ewell Blackwell gives up just one hit, a run-scoring double in the 4th
to Gene Hermanski, but the Dodgers whip the Reds ace, 2-1. Carl Erskine
allows three hits, including a double by Blackwell and a homerun by Ted
Kluszewski. Hermanski and Snider drive in the two runs for Brooklyn.

1951
The last Giant game of the season in St. Louis is rained out, and the
NL reschedules it for tomorrow afternoon as part of a doubleheader with
two teams.

In Cincinnati, Lloyd Merriman hits a bases-loaded triple in the 7th, off Carl
Erskine, to give the Reds a 6-3 win. Dodger starter Don Newcombe leaves in
the 1st inning with a pulled muscle in his pitching arm and Erskine takes
the loss. The Dodgers are now 5 1/2 ahead of the idle Giants.

1952
Braves pitcher Ernie Johnson is given 16 runs by his Boston teammates,
as he coasts to a 16-0 nitecap win against the Pirates. The Bucs win the
opener, 8-1, behind Bob Friend and Ralph Kiner. Kiner blasts his 35th and
36th homers, each with a man on, to stay one back of Sauer of the Cubs.

The Indians win their 9th in a row behind Early Wynn's 21st win, a 4-0
whitewash of the Red Sox. Wynn is pitching on two days rest, but allows
just 3 hits.

The Yankees (83-57) subdue the White Sox, 6-4, to remain a half game ahead
of the Indians. Tom Gorman is the winner over Hal Brown.

1953
At County Stadium, Carl Erskine defeats the Braves, 5-2, as the Dodgers
clinch the pennant earlier than any other NL team (see 9/9/36) in history.
Brooklyn goes 13 games up on Milwaukee with 12 left to play. Da Bums will
break their own record in 1955.

At New York, the Yankees take a 4-3 lead into the 7th inning, then score
8 runs to coast past Detroit, 13-4. The inning's big blow is Mantle's 20th
homer of the year, a 3-run shot off Billy Hoeft that is rising when it hits
the LF upper deck.

1954
A major-league record crowd of 86,587 jams Cleveland's Memorial Stadium to
see the Indians sweep a doubleheader from the Yanks, 4-1 and 3-2, behind
Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Al Rosen's two-run double is the key blow in
the opener. In the nitecap, Wally Westlake's double in the 5th is the big
hit. The Yanks now trail Cleveland (104-40) by 8 1/2 games.

In a double header at Pittsburgh, Ted Kluszewski drives in 9 runs to lead
the Reds to a sweep. In the 11-5 opening win, Klu drives in 6 runs with a
pair of homers. He knocks in 3 more in the 13-2 nitecap win.

The White Sox get their 89th and 90th victories, the first time this has
happened since 1920. They will win 94 for the season. They sweep the Red
Sox, 5-3 and 7-5, stealing 7 bases in the opener to overcome a Williams
homer. Minoso starts the scoring in game 2 with a 3-run homer in the 1st.

The Hollywood Stars' (PCL) Roger Bowman fires a 7-inning perfect game to
beat Portland, 10-0, and force a one-game playoff with San Diego for the
PCL pennant. But San Diego will win their 102nd game and the championship.

1955
Antonelli does it all. The Giants' Johnny Antonelli collects four hits
against the Braves - two singles, a double and a homerun - and four runs
batted in. He also pitches a complete-game 9-1 win.

1956
In Brooklyn, the Braves edge the Dodgers, 8-7, to break a first-place
tie. Bob Buhl gets the decision in relief, his club-record 8th win over the
Dodgers this year and the first National Leaguer since Tex Carleton in 1936
(vs. Boston) to accomplish the feat. Buhl's mark is a ML record for season
wins against the pennant winner. Joe Adcock belts his 13th homer against
the Dodgers this season, tying a ML mark set by Jimmie Foxx and tied by
Hank Sauer in 1954 of homers against one club. Billy Bruton's single is
the game winner. Bobby Thomson, who is unsuccessful on a steal of home is
fined $100 for the unauthorized attempt.

1957
The first-place Braves are beneficiaries of 2 disputed DPs to defeat the
Dodgers, 2-1. Joe Adcock returns to action for the first time since June
23. Covington hits into a DP in the 9th but ump Boggess had called time. He
then singles.

1958
The Giants sweep the Phillies, 5-2 and 19-2, as Mays has 6 hits to raise his
average to .333. Jim Davenport tops him with 7 hits, including a single and a
3-run inside-the-park HR during the 8-run first inning of game 2, and scores 7
runs. In game 2 Johnny Antonelli pitches a complete game for his 15th victory.

1959
Enroute to 21-15 season with the Giants, 33-year-old Toothpick Sam Jones
throws a four-hitter against Philadelphia to become the second black major
leaguer to win twenty games. In 1955, the right-hander from Ohio lost twenty
games pitching for the Cubs.

It is a day for 20-game winners. Sam Jones notches his 20th victory of the
season, 9-1, over the Phillies and puts the Giants back in first place by
a game. Jones has a pair of hits and scores twice.

Eddie Mathews hits a 2-run homer in the 8th off Don Newcombe as the Braves
beat the Reds, 4-3. Lew Burdette wins his 20th, beating Newk. The Braves'
Red Schoendienst returns to the line-up for the first time since being
diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis last November

White Sox veteran Early Wynn defeats the Orioles, 6-1, for his 20th win of
the year, the 5th time in his career that he's reached that plateau.

The Indians win, 7-2, over Washington behind the pitching of Gary Bell,
but fail to gain on the first place White Sox. Rocky Colavito hits his 41st
homer, while Jim Lemon connects for his 30th, the only solid hit off Bell.

1960
A crowd of more than 20,000 sees the first-place Pirates dump the Giants,
6-1, and set a new Pittsburgh home attendance record of 1,521,251 - 4,230
more than the old mark set in 1948.

1961
The Phillies drive Koufax from the mound in a 9-run 2nd inning and go on to
defeat the Dodgers, 19-10. The loss drops LA 4 1/2 games behind the Reds. The
big gun for the Phils is ex-Dodgers Don Demeter, who hits a 2-run homer in the
1st, singles in a run in the 2nd, adds a 3-run HR in the 7th and a solo-shot
in the 9th. He scores 5 runs. Two other Phils homer while 4 Dodgers go deep.

At Milwaukee, the Reds' Joey Jay beats his old team, 1-0, for his 20th
victory of the year. He's the Reds 1st 20-game winner since Blackwell in 1947.

1962
At Memorial Stadium, twenty-seven-year-old Senator fireballer Tom Cheney
sets a major league mark for K's in a single game by striking out 21 batters
in a complete-game 16-inning 2-1 victory over the Orioles. Bud Zipfel's
16th-inning HR off Dick Hall gives the Senators the win.

In Cleveland, Whitey and Mickey lead the way to a Yankee win, 5-2. Mantle
hits a 3-run homer in the 5th off Pedro Ramos, his 2nd favorite all-time
cousin (12 homers allowed).

In the dugout in Cincinnati, Willie Mays collapses from nervous exhaustion. He
is taken to the hospital and will miss 4 games. The Giants, 1 game behind
LA, lose, 4-1, and will lose their next 6 to seemingly take them out of the
race. But SF will recover along with their All-Star center fielder in time
to beat Los Angeles in a playoff to win the National league pennant.

1963
With former Dodger teammates, including Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella,
Don Newcombe and Ralph Branca, in attendance, Duke Snider is honored by the
Mets who hold his 'night' at the Polo Grounds, in a game that coincidentally
marks the last time the Giants, now located in San Francisco, will ever play
in their once long-time home. The 'Silver Fox', obtained by the expansion team
in April and who recently asked to be traded to a contender, tells the crowd
at the Harlem ball park, "I look up into the stands, and it looks like Ebbets
Field. The Mets are wonderful, but you can't take the Dodger out of Brooklyn".

1964
In Baltimore, the Orioles' Frank Bertaina and the A's Bob Meyer duel in the
ML's 5th double one-hitter, and the only all-rookie one. Bertaina prevails,
1-0, his 1st ML win and only decision of the year. Johnny Orsino's 8th-inning
double and Doc Edwards 5th inning two-bagger account for the only hit for
each team. The game's lone run scores in the bottom of the eighth inning
after a leadoff double by the #8 hitter Orsino, who takes third on a bunt
and scores a sac fly. Baltimore sets a major-league record for fewest at-bats
in a 9-inning game (8 times at-bat) with 19, and both clubs go to the plate
just 46 times. The last battle of matching one-hitters was June 21, 1956.

The Indians score 6 in the 1st, and outlast the White Sox, 11-10. For
2nd-place Chicago, it is their 4th loss in 6 games. The loss goes to starter
Ray Herbert, with Sam McDowell the victor.

1965
Washington's Brant Alyea debuts with a pinch-hit HR on the first pitch from
Rudy May in his first ML at-bat. Yes, it ties a major-league record. In
Washington, 840 fans watch the Senators beat the Angels, 7-1.

1966
Ron Perranoski of the Dodgers fans the first 6 batters he faces and earns
a 3-2 win over the Mets and Tug McGraw. With the help of 2B Ron Hunt, Mets
rookie SS Bud Harrelson picks off Lou Johnson with the hidden ball trick
in the 6th.

1967
The Reds rout the Pirates, winning 15-7.

1969
Juan Marichal (18-10) pitches a one-hitter as the Giants beat the Reds, 1-0,
but Atlanta takes the NL West lead by beating Houston, 4-3. Tommy Helms'
3rd-inning single is the only hit in what Marichal calls "my best game ever."

Pitchers Jerry Koosman and Don Cardwell both hurl 1-0 wins and drive in the
winning runs, as the hot Mets sweep the Pirates. The Cubs, meanwhile, win,
snapping their 8-game losing streak, but now trail by 2 1/2 games.

1973
Pitcher Jack Billingham hits a bases-loaded double to help his cause as
the Reds beat the Dodgers, 7-3.

1974

game 2 by a 6-2 score. Johnny Bench hits the 3rd grand slam of the day in
game 2. Bench will finish the year with 129 RBIs to top the NL, and his 315

lead a league in TB (Bench caught 137 games, 36 games at 3B, 5 games at 1B).

1976
DH Minnie Minoso singles for the White Sox against the Angels' Sid Monge. At
53, Minoso is believed the oldest ever to collect a hit in the ML (although
he says in his autobiography that he was born in 1925, not 1922 as listed in
the record books). But research by historian Bill Carle will reveal that Jim
O'Rourke, who hit safely on September 22, 1904 was 54 years and ten-months
old. Minnie will make another appearance against Monge on September 30, going
0 for 2. Monge loses today, 2-1, with the victory going to Goose Gossage.

With Minnesota leading 7-4 in the bottom of the 4th, Terry Felton relieves
Twins starter Brad Havens. Felton leaves in the bottom of the sixth with one
out, runners on first and second and his team clinging to a 7-6 lead. Both
runners score and by the time the Royals are through, instead of his first
ML win, Felton ends up charged with his 16th (and final) career loss. Kansas
City wins royally, 18-7, one of the biggest comebacks of the decade. John
Pacella, who takes over in the 8th, surrenders back-to-back dingers to
Havens and White, tosses 2 wild pitches, and allows 6 runs. Aiken adds a
pair of homers for KC.

For the 2nd time this season, Milwaukee gets 3 consecutive HRs - Cooper,

the season with scout John Hart.

1990

walks 8 batters in just 1 1/3 innings as Texas wins, 5-4. Adkins walks the
first three batters, then retires the side. After a fly out in the 2nd, he
walks the next five before being lifted, two shy of Dolly Gray's consecutive
walk record.

1991
Texas Ranger Nolan Ryan wins his 10th game, beating the Twins, 4-3, and
becoming just the second pitcher ever to reach double figures in wins in

the Brewers in the 7th inning of the 15-12 Chicago win. Sosa joins Babe Ruth
(1927 Yankees), Roger Maris (1961 Yankees) and Mark McGwire (1998 Cardinals)
in reaching one of baseball's most cherished milestones. The Cubs power 6
homers, including two pinch hit, to win. Tyler Houston hits a pinch HR in

covering 1B completes the twin killing.
