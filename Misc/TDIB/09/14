1901
Boston's Cy Young records his 30th win of the year, beating the visiting
Washington Senators, 12-1.

W. A. Phelon Jr, writing in today's issue of Sporting Life reports:
"Noiseless umpiring is to be attempted at the South Side park Monday
[the 16th] afternoon. Impossible as this may seem at first hearing, it
is to be attempted, and there are even bets that it will be a go. George
W. Hancock, famed in Chicago as the man who invented indoor base ball,
will be responsible for the success or failure of the scheme. The umpire
is to wear a red sleeve on the right arm and a white one on the left. For
a strike he will raise the right arm, for a ball the left; for an out he
will hoist the right arm, for a ball [sic] the other. People at the far end
of the park, unable to hear even that human buffalo, Sheridan, can see the
colors, and there seems a good chance for the trick to make a hit." There
is no report that this was put into effect.

1902
As noted by Gil Bogan, Tinker, Evers and Chance pull off their first DP in
a 7-4 win over the Reds. Alex Hardy beats Bill Phillips. This date is one

due to darkness caused by an impending storm.

1904
The Boston Americans, with a half-game lead over New York, sends Bill
Dinneen to the mound. Patsy Dougherty leads off with a single off Jack
Chesbro and Willie Keeler follows with a bunt that C Lou Criger fires into

his first start, against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. Brooklyn breaks a
scoreless tie with 2 runs in the 7th, after Honus Wagner flubs a DP grounder
hit by Casey Stengel. Wagner, who ostensibly had told the rookie to have
Stengel hit the ball to short, reportedly says, "Those damn big feet of
mine have always been in my way (Okrent & Wulf)." Pittsburgh scores 2 in
the 8th to tie but pitcher Larry Cheney hits a run-scoring double in the
bottom of the 9th to win it for Brooklyn.

Exercising a baseball superstition, Tiger manager Jennings designates
it "Shocker Day" in honor of former Detroit sandlot star Urban Shocker,
the rookie starter for the visiting Yankees (as noted by historian Steve
Steinberg). Instead of being jinxed by the "honor", Shocker puts a crimp
in the Tigers' first-place ideas with a 4-2 win. The Yankees use a rare
suicide double squeeze to score two runners, from 2B and 3B, to win.

line drive to Donie Bush is turned into a triple play. For Bush, it is the
9th time he has taken part in a TP as a fielder, a ML record. He hit into
one once, tying him with Sisler for the all-time mark of 10 triple plays
(Sisler:  fielded 7, hit 3). Jack Tobin singles in the 7th, but Johnson
picks him off. Tobin will set the AL record this year with 179 singles,
a mark that Sam Rice will top in 1925. The Senators' only run today comes
when Dixie Davis hits Picinich with a bases-loaded pitch, forcing in a run.

13-5, their 10th straight win, while the Cards split a doubleheader in
Boston. Babe Herman once again stops to watch a HR disappear for a record
2nd time in one season. This time, Glenn Wright bounces a ball into the
CF stands and lopes past the awestruck Herman to reduce the bounce HR
to a single. The Robins score 6 runs in the 1st inning, the 7th straight
game they've tallied in the first frame. Brooklyn (83-60) ends the day a
half-game in front of St. Louis, and a game ahead of the Cubs.

take the loss. Starter Charlie Root is the Chicago winner.

Meanwhile, the Giants top the faltering Cards, 5-4 in 11 innings, to move into
3rd place, just 3 1/2 games in back of the Cubs. The Cards drop to 2nd with
the loss. Paul Dean was to start today's game but he suffered what is called
a severe heart attack while attending the Canzoneri-Ghnouly bout. Heusser

Dean, making his 4th appearance in five games, comes on. Heusser has the
only homer in the game, hitting his first in the majors off Hubbell in the
6th. It's not his only hit as he and Joe Medwick swing at each other after

then we'll use Sain, then an off day, followed by rain. Back will come Spahn,
followed by Sain. And followed, we hope, by two days of rain. The poem will
shorten in the public memory to "Spahn and Sain and pray for rain."

pinch hitting for McLain, walks and scores the tying run. Denny (30-5)
gives up 6 hits and strikes out 10. McLain is the first thirty-game winner
since Dizzy Dean reached the milestone in 1934.

Pittsburgh's Bob Veale shuts out the Mets, 6-0, on 8 hits and is backed by
two homeruns from Roberto Clemente.

1969
With more than two weeks left in the season, the Orioles clinch the first-ever
American League East title when they beat Cleveland at Memorial Stadium,
7-3. The heavily-favored Birds will sweep Minnesota, the AL West Champs, to
capture a pennant, but will lose the World Series in five games to New York.

1971
The Dodgers beat the first-place Giants, 6-5, to climb within one game of
first place in the NL Western Division. Bobby Bonds has 2 homers for SF,
but Manny Mota's pinch-hit double in the 9th drives in 3 runs.

1972
The Padres stake Steve Arlin to a 5-0 lead in the 3rd, but the Astros score
6 in their half of the frame and go on to win, 10-6. For Arlin it is his
20th loss of the year, topping his ML high 19 losses in 1971.

1973
In Cincinnati, the Reds score three runs in the 9th to trip the Braves,
7-6. Bobby Tolan drives in the winner after Phil Gagliano drives in 2 runs
with a 2-out single.

1974
Graig Nettles homers for the Yankees in the first inning, and brother
Jim Nettles homers for the Tigers in the 2nd. This is the 2nd time that
the 2 brothers have homered in the same game for different teams, having
done it on June 11, 1972, when Graig was on Cleveland and Jim was with
Minnesota. Graig's team wins, 10-7.

In LA, the Reds defeat the Dodgers, 4-2, to pull to within 1 1/2 games of
the NL West lead. That's as close as they come as they lose 6 of their next
8 games.

1975
Mel Ott's forty-seven year-old record is broken when Brewers' shortstop
Robin Yount plays his 242nd major league game as a teenager. The youthful
infielder was 18 years 2 months 6 days old when he made his debut with
Milwaukee in 1973. The Red Sox top the Brewers, 8-6.

1976
At Memorial Stadium, Dennis Martinez makes his major league debut pitching
5 2/3 innings of shutout baseball in relief to get the win in the Orioles'
9-7 victory over the Tigers. The Granada native, who will win 245 games,
is the first person from Nicaragua to appear in a major league game.

1977
In an 8-5 Milwaukee win, veteran Ken McMullen hits a pinch homer for the
Brewers in the 8th inning against Seattle's Tom House. The homer, McMullen's
156th, comes on his last ML at-bat. He'll be released in December and retire.

1978
Jim Bouton, 38, after retiring from pro baseball, earns a 4-1 win for
the Braves over the Giants. It is Bouton's first ML victory since 1970,
and the last of his career. The Bulldog gives up just 3 hits in 6 innings.

The Angels score 13 unearned runs in the 9th inning to cap a 16-1 win over
the Rangers.

1980
Eddie Murray hits 3 HRs, but Baltimore loses to Toronto, 4-3 in 13 innings,
to fall 5 games behind the first-place Yankees in the AL East.

In a 10-7 win over the Cubs, Lee Mazzilli homers to break a drought for
the Mets (as noted by Tom Ruane). It is the 1st homer in 175 2/3 innings
going back to August 26 when Claudell Washington homered. This will be the
longest drought for the rest of the century. The Mets also had droughts of
134 1/3 innings (4/15 - 5/3) and 117 1/3 innings (5/6 - 5/24).

1982

a season by beating the Royals, 2-1, on a 5-hitter.

major league homerun. The 475-foot blast hit by the NFL running back is
the longest homer ever hit in the ballpark. Kansas City downs Seattle, 10-3.

At Candlestick Park, Giants Bob Brenly, a catcher subbing at 3B, ties a ML
record by committing 4 errors in one inning of San Francisco's 7-6 victory
over the Braves. Brenly atones for his errors with a homer in the 5th,
a game-tying 2-run single in the 7th, and a 2-out game-winning homerun in
the bottom of the 9th.

1987
The Blue Jays blast a major league record of ten homeruns in an 18-3 rout
of the Orioles at Camden Yards. Ernie Whitt goes deep three times, Rance
Mulliniks and George Bell each hit a pair and Lloyd Moseby, Rob Ducey and
Fred McGriff each go deep once with Baltimore's Mike Hart adding one to
tie the two-team major league mark of 11 (it has now been accomplished 7
times). Orioles manager Cal Ripken Sr ends his son's record streak at 8,243
consecutive innings (a span of 908 games) by replacing Cal Jr in the 8th with
pinch runner Earl Washington. Jr's game streak is at 827. In the seventh
inning Kelly Gruber, appearing as a pinch-hitter, makes all three outs by
hitting into a double play and then finishing the seven-run frame with a
strikeout. In between his at-bats, there are five singles and two homeruns.

1988
In his first start against his former club, Mike Boddicker beats the Orioles,
4-1, with Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell hitting for the cycle. Last month,
Baltimore traded the popular right-hander, who had spent nine years with
the club, to Boston in return for Brady Anderson and Curt Schilling. Lee
Smith notches his 26th save.

Led by 2 rookies and a 9-run 4th inning, off Dave Stewart, Texas beats the
A's, 9-1. Kevin Brown is the winning pitcher while his batterymate Chad
Kreuter ties a ML record in his debut with 2 hits in the 4th inning. One
hit is a 3-run HR. Kreuter is the 3rd rookie (Billy Martin, Russ Morman)
to have 2 hits in one inning. Brown, who won in his debut in 1986, improves
his career mark to 2-0.

1989
The ML owners approve the sale of the Mariners to Jeff Smulyan and Michael
Browning for $77 million, the highest price ever paid for an AL club.

Jeff Reardon saves Minnesota's 2-0 win over Toronto to become the first
pitcher ever to record at least 30 saves in 5 consecutive seasons.

Houston's Mike Scott (20-8) becomes a 20-game winner for the first time by
beating the Dodgers, 11-3. He is the first ML pitcher to reach that plateau
this season.

In St. Louis, the Cards draw just 1,519 - a stadium record - for a game
with the Pirates.

1990
Mariner Ken Griffey and his son, Junior, become the first father and son to
hit homers in the same major league game. The back-to-back blasts are given
up by Angel hurler Kirk McCaskill in the 1st. California beats Seattle, 7-5.

Oakland's Dave Stewart wins his 20th game of the season, 9-1, over the Twins
to become the first pitcher since Jim Palmer (1975-78) to post 4 straight
20-game seasons.

1991
Mariano Duncan, Hal Morris and Paul O'Neill hit back-to-back-to-back HRs
off Astros hurler Mark Portugal for the Reds. The homers account for the
only Cincinnati runs in a 7-3 loss.

In the 10th inning of the game between Cleveland and Baltimore, Indians
reliever Eric Bell pitches to Orioles 2B Juan Bell, who skies a fly to left
where it is caught by the Tribe's Albert Belle. Cleveland comes out on top
with a 6-5 win, and Eric Bell, with 1 2/3 innings of relief, rings up his
first win.

In the Tigers' 6-4 win over the Brewers, Detroit's Cecil Fielder hits a
502-foot HR, which is believed to be the 1st ball ever hit out of Milwaukee's
County Stadium, off Dan Plesac. The ball lands in the back of a truck driven
by Gary Schumacher, who doesn't stop until he is near Madison.

1994
The remainder of the baseball season is canceled by acting commissioner Bud
Selig after 34 days of the players' strike. There will be no World Series
for the 1st time since 1904.

1995
The sale of the Oakland Athletics for $85 million to Steven Schott and Ken
Hoffman is approved by major league owners. A provision of the sale is that
the team must remain in Oakland.

1996
Oakland 1B Mark McGwire becomes the 13th player in history to hit 50
HRs in a season as he connects against Chad Ogea in the 1st inning of
Cleveland's 9-8 win over the A's in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. The
big first baseman hit his 49th in the 1st inning of the opener, a 9-2 loss
to the Indians. Because of injuries, McGwire has played in only 119 or his
team's 150 games. The Cardinal first baseman gives the milestone ball to
his eight-year-old son, Matthew.

Mets C Todd Hundley hits his 41st HR of the season to set a new major
league mark for catchers (previously held by Roy Campanella). The Mets
defeat Atlanta, 6-5 in 12 innings. Johnny Bench hit 45 in 1970, but only
38 while behind the plate. Hundley also owns the Mets HR record, previously
held by Darryl Strawberry with 39.

The City of Houston and Harris County agree to terms with the Astros to
build a $265 million stadium with a retractable roof. The deal needs several
approvals, including a November 5 referendum.

1997
Sandy Alomar hits a bases-loaded single to key a bizarre seven-run 8th,
and Cleveland defeats Chicago, 8-3. Jim Thome nails his 40th homer for
the Indians. Chicago ties a major league record by using nine pitchers
in the nine-inning game, including 5 in the 8th. The 4th in that inning,
Keith Foulke, is called in without a warmup by manager Terry Bevington
to intentionally walk a batter. The Tribe increases its AL Central lead
to 7 1/2 games over Chicago and Milwaukee. Before the game the Sox retire
Carlton Fisk's #72. Bitter over his 1993 release and not being allowed into
the locker room during the playoffs that year, Fisk requests that Jerry
Reinsdorf and GM Ron Schueler not be there for the ceremony.

Mark McGwire notches his 51st homer, and the St. Louis Cardinals score seven
runs in the eighth to win, 10-4. McGwire, the first player with consecutive
50-homer seasons since Babe Ruth in 1927-28, connects off Joey Hamilton
(11-6) in the sixth. He has 17 homers in 37 games since St. Louis acquired
him from Oakland on July 31 and has 14 games remaining to chase Roger Maris'
season record of 61.

1998
At Kauffman Stadium, the Royals become the fifth team in baseball history
to score in every inning. The eight innings of consistency leads to a 16-6
win over the A's.

In another pitchers duel, the White Sox score twice in the 12th inning,
then hold on for a 17-16 win over the Tigers. The teams combine for 41 hits,
including 5 each for Albert Belle of the Sox and rookie OF Juan Encarnacion
of the Bengals. Encarnacion also score 5 runs while driving home 4. Belle
and SS Craig Wilson bring home 5 each for Chicago.

1999
With a 12-2 pounding of the Phillies at the Astrodome, Houston establishes
a club record with a twelve-game winning streak. The Astros' victory also
extends Philadelphia's losing streak to 11 consecutive losses.

The Expos defeat the Dodgers, 3-0, behind Javier Vazquez' 1-hitter. Vazquez
allows just a leadoff single to Mark Grudzielanek in the 4th inning, and
a walk to Gary Sheffield in the same frame, while fanning 10.

The Royals lose a doubleheader to the Angels, 8-6 in the opener and 6-5 in
the nightcap. In the second game, KC OF Mark Quinn makes a memorable major
league debut. After making an out in his 1st trip to the plate, Quinn doubles
in his next at-bat, then hits homers in his last 2 times up. He becomes just
the 3rd player in history to hit 2 HRs in his 1st big league game. Bob Nieman
(1951) and Bert Campaneris (1964) are the only others to accomplish the feat.

The Yankees rally with a pair of grand slams, just the 3rd time in club
history, to beat the Blue Jays, 10-6. Bernie Williams ties the game with a
slam in the 8th inning, and Paul O'Neill wins it in the 9th with a walkoff
grand slam.

2002
Barry Bonds ties Hank Aaron for the most 100-RBI seasons by a National
League player as he drives in his 100th run of the season for the 11th
time in his career. The major league record is 13 shared by Jimmie Foxx,
Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.

Chin-Feng Chen becomes the first Taiwan-born player to appear in the major
leagues as he walks and scores as a pinch-hitter for the Dodgers against
the Rockies. The 24-year-old first baseman-outfielder played for the 1990
Taiwan team which won the Little League World Series.

Playing the 148th game on the schedule, the Devil Rays suffer their 100th
defeat losing to the Blue Jays at the SkyDome, 8-4. Tampa Bay (48-100)
becomes the first team to lose 100 games in consecutive seasons since Toronto
accomplished the dubious mark for three straight years starting in 1979.

P Derek Lowe wins his 20th game as the Red Sox beat the Orioles, 6-4. Lowe
becomes the 1st pitcher in history to win 20 games the season after saving
20. He is also the 1st to record at least 40 saves and later win 20. Dennis
Eckersley and John Smoltz did it the other way around.

The Yankees beat the White Sox, 8-4, in a rain-shortened affair. Chicago
C Miguel Olivo hits a 3-run HR in his 1st ML at-bat.

The Diamondbacks shut out the Brewers, 5-0, as Randy Johnson wins his 22nd
game of the season. Johnson fans 17 Milwaukee batters in the contest.

2003
Homering in his final at-bat, Vladimir Guerrero hits for 'Le Carrousel'
at Montreal's Olympic Stadium. Facing Mets southpaw Tom Glavine, the
Expo's right fielder doubled (2nd), singled (3rd) and hit a triple (5th)
and completed the sixth cycle in team history going deep off Dan Wheeler
(7th). The Expos down the Mets, 7-3.

At Comerica Park, Detroit set a franchise record for losses as they drop
their 110th loss to the Royals, 7-2. The 1996 Tiger squad finished the
season with a 53-109 record. They are also the first team in 34 years to
lose 110 games in a season. The last teams to reach the mark were the 1969
expansion Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres.

The Diamondbacks shut out the Rockies, 5-0, as Randy Johnson hurls a
1-hitter. Rene Reyes' 5th-inning single is Colorado's only safety.

2004
The Mets fire manager Art Howe, effective at the end of the season.

Corey Patterson hits a 2-run homer in the 8th to tie the Pirates, 2-2,
then hits a walkoff homer in the 12th for a 3-2 Cubs win.

2005
Braves center fielder Andruw Jones hits his 50th homerun in the eighth
inning of a 12-4 loss to the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The Curacao
native is the first major leaguer to reach the plateau since Alex Rodriguez
hit 57 homers playing shortstop for the Rangers in 2002.

As a tribute to his mother, Roger Clemens pitches on the day his mom Bess
passes away. The 'Rocket' gets the win as the Astros beat the Marlins,
10-2, the score his Mom predicted when she told him she wanted him to start
that night.

On his way to home plate to score ahead of Tony Graffanino, who homered
over the left-field wall, Gabe Kapler ruptures his Achilles tendon while
rounding second base and he cannot continue around the bases. After a delay
of five-minutes, the Red Sox outfielder is carried off the field and is
replaced in the base paths by pinch runner Alejandro Machad to finish the
trip around the diamond in Boston's 5-3 win over Toronto at the Skydome.

2007
Ten-year-old Bosox fan Griffin Whitman is disappointed as Yankees outfielder
Shelley Duncan, when asked for an autograph, writes in the boy's spiral-bound
notebook, "RED SOX SUCK!" before signing his name. The 27-year-old flychaser,
whose dad is the respected pitching coach of the Cardinals, is surprised
by the negative reaction of the family.

2008
Carlos Zambrano becomes the first Cubs pitcher to throw a no-hitter since
Milt Pappas accomplished the feat against the Padres in 1972. The Chicago
right-hander's 5-0 hitless gem comes at the expense of the displaced Astros,
who are playing a relocated 'home game' in Milwaukee's Miller Park as a
result of Hurricane Ike.

With his 8th-inning thievery in a 7-4 loss to the Braves at Shea Stadium,
Mets shortstop Jose Reyes becomes the first player to have four straight
seasons of 50 or more stolen bases playing for a New York area team, which
also includes the Yankees, the Dodgers and the Giants. The accomplishment
extends the infielder's own record as he is also the only Gotham major
leaguer to achieve the feat for three consecutive years.

2009
Brett Tomko of the Oakland Athletics wins his 100th game.

2011
With their 3-2 loss to St. Louis, the Pirates extend their record streak
of consecutive losing seasons to 19 straight years, the longest in American
professional sports history. The Bucs, who led the NL Central by a half-game
on July 20, have lost 38 of 54 contests since then, leaving the team with
a 67-82 won-loss record.

Braves fireballer Brandon Beachy establishes the modern franchise record for
strikeouts in a season by a rookie pitcher when he whiffs eight batters in
4 1/3 innings, bringing his total to 160. Irv Young struck out 156 in 1905
when the team played in Boston and were known as the Beaneaters.

After missing 50 contests for a PED infraction in April 2008 while playing
for the Giants, Eliezer Alfonzo becomes the first player to be suspended
twice under the MLB drug program. The Colorado catcher will appeal the
100-game suspension, having the ban overturned for procedural reasons
when his urine sample is not handled in the manner outlined in baseball's
agreement with the players.

2014
With Cub runners on first and second in the fourth inning of the team's
7-3 victory over Chicago, the Pirates turn a 5-4-3 around-the-horn triple
play when third baseman Josh Harrison fields Matt Szczur's hard grounder,
stepping on the bag to force Chris Valaika before firing the ball to second
to Neil Walker to retire Mike Ott. The second baseman's relay to first sacker
Andrew Lambo completes the first triple killing in the 14-year history of
PNC Park.

Jonathan Papelbon is ejected for grabbing his crotch, responding to the
boos from the Citizens Bank Park crowd after he gives up four runs in
the ninth inning of Phillies' 5-4 loss to Miami. The Philadelphia closer,
who will apologize while insisting he wasn't making a vulgar motion toward
fans, will be suspended for seven games and fined by Major League Baseball
for making a lewd gesture and for bumping Joe West, the ump who will also
receive a one-day suspension for pulling on the reliever's jersey after he
threw the player out of the game.

2017
The Indians claimed sole possession of the second longest winning streak
all time with their 22nd consecutive victory with a 3–2 walk off win in
extra innings against the Kansas City Royals, only for their winning streak
to come to an end the next day with a 4–3 loss to the Royals.
