1906
Brooklyn blanks the Giants in two games, winning 6-0 and 1-0, at Washington
Park. All the NL games result in a shutout today.

Sox are more patient in the 2nd game, and walk 12 times off Cap Crowell to
win, 13-2.

1916
Twenty-three fans attending the game against the Yankees at rain-soaked
Shibe Park, the smallest crowd in American League history, witness A's
switch-hitter Wally Schang become the first player in major league history
homer from both sides of the plate in the same game. The next AL player to
hits HRs from both sides will be Johnny Lucadello in 1940.

1917
Following yesterday's loss to Chicago, Browns owner Phil Ball accuses
his players of laying down on the job because they dislike manager Fielder
Jones. SS Doc Lavan and 2B Del Pratt sue him for $50,000 damages for alleged

congratulates the Babe on his feat. New York's SS Roger Peckinpaugh ties an AL
mark with 15 chances accepted in the first game, and 24 in the twinbill. The
Tigers object to the 2nd game, on the technicality that it was originally
scheduled for Boston and had been postponed there.

1920
On their way to Cleveland, the Yanks play an exhibition game against the
Pirates and suffer injuries to starters Muddy Ruel (split finger) and Ping

any scenes, New York is short handed.

1922
The Yankees go back on top, this time to stay, beating the Senators, 8-1,
behind Carl Mays. while the Browns lose to Detroit, 8-3. New York's win

game of the top.

the Phils to give Brooklyn a 1-0 win. The Dodgers complete the sweep with
a 4-3 game-2 win.

The Browns put 18 men on base against Detroit's Lil Stoner, but only one
of them scores in the 11-1 loss. St. Louis has 13 hits, 4 walks and a hit
batsman to reach base.

1926
The Phils trail the Dodgers, 4-2, going into the last of the 9th but rally
to win, 8-4. The winning blow is Cy Williams' grand slam, the 2nd Philley
slam in 3 days.

1927
The A's Lefty Grove beats Detroit, 9-1, and holds Harry Heilmann, hitting
.395, hitless. Grove shows the batting leader how it's done, going 2 for 3,
with a HR, 3 RBIs and a stolen base. Heilmann will go 0 for 12 before his

5 hits for the Yankees, including 2 HRs in a 5-4 win.

In the Pirates' 12-2 loss to Brooklyn, Buc C Earl Grace makes a wild throw
to end a streak of 110 consecutive errorless games. It is Grace's only

are recorded.

win, 7-5. Cochrane has 3 hits in each game for Detroit. The sweep increases
their AL lead to 10 games.

1937

New York's Red Ruffing and Bobo Newsom battle to a 2-2 tie before Myril Hoag
drives in Gehrig with the winning run in the 9th inning. Then in game 2,
the Yankees make just two hits off Jack Wilson and are down 6-1 with two

a double error by Cronin and a single by Joe DiMaggio ties the score at 6

because of violent thunder and lightning.

1942
The first exhibition game between two Negro League teams is finally played
in Boston when the Philadelphia Stars edge the Baltimore Elite Giants in a
rain-shortened seven-inning game at Fenway Park, 8-7. The Cradle of Liberty,
unlike many metropolitan areas in the East and South, did not have a Black
team represent the city, nor did the community embrace the concept of
hosting Negro League contests.

The Dodgers move 3 games ahead of the idle Cards by beating the Pirates,
4-0. Ed Head allows just 4 hits.

1946
With the Red Sox running away with the AL race, attention closes in on Bob
Feller's strikeout pace. After a 4-1 Browns opening win, Feller tops the
Browns, 3-2, on six hits and 8 strikeouts and reaches 300 today, a number
reached by Walter Johnson and Rube Waddell twice each. Can Feller beat
Waddell's 347 of 1904? Boudreau finds plenty of innings for Feller to work
as the season comes to an end and statisticians discover an error in the
Aug. 24th boxscore that shorted the fireballer one strikeout against the
A's. Counting that one, Feller ends with 348. Alas! Waddell's old record of
347 was apparently based on the compilations of George Moreland, an early
baseball historian, and listed in Little Red Book. TSN researchers later
revise Waddell's total to 349. Feller's 348 strikeouts will lead the AL,
while Johnny Schmitz will lead the NL with a pedestrian 135. The 213 K
difference between the 2 league leaders is a ML record that will not be
topped this century.

Dodger Pete Reiser, even though still as injury-prone as he was before the
war, accounts for 3 of the Dodgers' 7 steals, including home, in an 11-3
Dodger victory over the Giants. It is his 7th steal of home this year. He will
lead the ML with 34 steals despite missing more than 30 games due to injuries.

The Browns sweep a pair from the Yankees, winning 2-1 and 9-8, both in extra
innings. Yankee manager Bill Dickey makes his last ML at-bat a good one,
lining a pinch single in the 8th inning.

will be credited with 456 strikeouts, breaking the former mark of 418 set
by Virgil Trucks in the Alabama-Florida League in 1938.

1947
Bob Feller, in relief of Bob Lemon in the 9th, keeps the Yankees scoreless
to save a 4-3 Cleveland win. George McQuinn, who earlier hit two homers,
bloops a single with a man on to chase Lemon. Bobo Newsom, who wilts in
the 8th, is the loser, but New York is still 12 games in front.

1948
At Boston, the Red Sox turn back the Yankees, 10-6, to lead by 3 games in
the loss column. The Indians blow a 7-3 lead against the Tigers, but hold
on to win, 8-7, in the 11th. Doby scores the winning run.

1949
Hurling a 3-hitter, Harry Brecheen continues his mastery over the Cubs
as the Cards win, 8-0. Brecheen, 3-0 this year against Chicago, is 26-6
lifetime. Schoendienst starts the game with a single and stolen base, then
scores on Musial's safety. The steal is the Cards' 17th and last this year,
a ML record for fewest steals.

At Boston, Russ Meyer tosses a one-hitter for the Phils to give the Braves
their 9th straight loss, 3-1. Connie Ryan's RBI-double is the only safety
for the Hubmen. It is Meyer's 2nd one-hitter, having thrown one with the
Cubs. The crowd of 5,856 is the smallest in Boston night history.

1950

run from 3B when he provokes Jim Hearn into wild pitching. Giants pitchers
contribute 10 walks.

At an Old-Timer's Day at Yankee Stadium, former manager Joe McCarthy is
honored. With the game scoreless in the 7th inning, Mantle belts a Bob
Porterfield pitch into the last row of the RF bleachers, some 460 feet away to
break the scoreless tie. Ed Lopat shuts out the Senators for 4-0 Yankee win.

1952
An umpire ejects Giants P Larry Jansen for throwing a ball in the 9th inning
of game one that nips Bobby Cox on the hip. Giants manager Leo Durocher
is also suspended and fined $100. Jansen is fined just $25 because of his
"excellent conduct record." Brooklyn splits the doubleheader, winning the
opener, 10-2, and losing the nightcap, 3-2, to reliever Sal Maglie. The
Dodger lead stays at 5 games.

games back.

Washington, 16-2. Five Yankees have 3 hits apiece, led by Hank Bauer with
a double, triple and homer.

The Dodgers edge the Giants, 4-3, on pitcher Don Bessent's 8th inning
sac fly. Gil Hodges loses his glove in the 7th and, dispite the public
announcement request for help in finding it, the glove doesn't reappear
till the 9th when an offer is made to swap it for a new glove. The trade
with a fan happens seconds later with no questions asked.

Young Moe Drabowsky pitches the Cubs to a 2-1 victory over the
Braves. Brooklyn now trails Milwaukee by a half-game. Milwaukee will sweep
a pair from the Cubs tomorrow.

1957
Before their departure to play on the West Coast for next season, the
Dodgers and Giants face one another for the final time in New York. The Jints

the boroughs.

becomes the oldest 20-game winner.

1964
The Mets announce the signing of 18-year-old right-hander Bill Denehy. The

and won three tournament games enroute to leading his team to the state
championship.

Phils first baseman Frank Thomas fractures his right thumb sliding back into
1B in the 3-2 loss to the Dodgers. The Phils are six games ahead, but Thomas'
loss will be felt keenly when the Phils begin to slide. Art Mahaffey takes
the loss, lasting just a third of an inning. Thirty-six-year-old Jim Brewer
wins his first ML start.

1965
Bert Campaneris plays all 9 positions against the Angels in a promotion
to hype poor attendance at Kansas City. When Campy takes the mound in the

out. Campy allows one run, and leaves the game in the 9th after a collision
with Angels C Ed Kirkpatrick at home plate when Campy is catching. Rene
