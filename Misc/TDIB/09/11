1902
John Malarkey, leading off in the bottom of the 11th inning, hits a homer off
St. Louis right-hander Mike O'Neill to give the Beaneaters a 4-3 victory in
the first game of a twin bill at Boston's South End Grounds. Malarkey becomes
the first pitcher in baseball history to earn a victory by hitting his own
walk-off homerun. It's Malarkey's only ML homer. Game 2 ends in a 2-2 tie.

1903
The Cardinals' Kid Nichols beats the Reds, 4-2, in the first of two
games. Encouraged, Nichols pitches the nitecap as well, but the Reds reach
him for 14 hits to win, 8-5. As manager, Nichols keeps himself in the game
rather than waste another pitcher.

A new National Agreement signed by the National Association of minor league
clubs officially organizes professional baseball under one comprehensive
set of rules.

1905
The Highlanders sell workhorse pitcher Jack Powell (8-13) to the
Browns. Powell won 23 games in 1904, pitching 390 1/3 innings.

The Washington Senators roll to a 14-0 score over Boston in a game 2 win,
setting a club record for runs in a shutout that will be tied but never
topped. The game ends after 7 innings, with darkness, not the mercy rule,
as the reason.

1906
In Boston, New York's Christy Mathewson (19-9) shuts out the Beaneaters,
3-0, striking out 9. Today's game is the last one in which John McGraw,
playing 3B, appears in the lineup.

At New York, the Boston Americans take it on the chin, losing 11-3. Frank
LaPorte hits an inside-the-park homerun off Boston starter Ed Barry in
the 6th and when the inning ends Boston second baseman Hobe Ferris punches
teammate right fielder Jack Hayden. After they are separated, Hayden goes to
the bench and Ferriss runs after him and kicks him. Umpire Hank O'Loughlin
ejects both of them, but Ferris refuses to go. Two policemen escort him to
the clubhouse and he is arrested for assault (as noted by Clem Conly).

1907
Chicago's Doc White blanks the St. Louis Browns, 2-0. However, his one base
on balls ends his AL record run of 65 1/3 IP without issuing a walk. He
will win a career-high 27 games and walk only 38 in 291 innings pitched.

1909
The Athletics and Red Sox split a doubleheader, each team winning,
1-0. The Red Sox also pick up pitcher Jack Chesbro (0-4) on waivers from
the Highlanders. The future Hall of Famer will pitch and lose one game
(to New York) for Boston before calling it quits at 199-131.

Christy Mathewson and catcher Chief Meyers are all that the Giants need in the
opener against Brooklyn. Matty allows 3 hits in shutting down the Superbas,
and the Chief clubs his first major league homer in the 2nd inning, a grand
slam to score all the runs. New York wins, 4-0, beating Elmer Knetzer. The
Superbas take the nitecap, 10-1, behind Bugs Raymond. Rookie Zack Wheat
has his first 2 ML hits in the nitecap, after being collared in the opener
by Matty.

1912
In St. Louis, Browns starter Jack Powell leaves after 7 innings, losing
3-0 to the Highlanders. Reliever George Baumgartner gives up 2 more runs
in the 8th, but the Browns score 4 in the bottom of the inning to cut the
losing margin to 5-4. The New York Times reports the loss to Baumgartner,
who pitched poorly.

In a tumultuous game featuring an attack on an umpire and three ejections,
Eddie Collins swipes six bases to pace the A's to a 9-7 win over the
Tigers. The Bengal battery is Brad Kocher and P Joe Lake. In the 3rd inning,
Cobb foils an intentional walk when he steps across the plate to slap a
single. To the dismay of the home crowd, Ump Tommy Connolly calls a foul
strike, and manager Hughey Jennings gets tossed for protesting. Collins
swipes 3 bases in the 7th inning and, on the front end of a double steal,
crosses the plate, but Frank Baker is thrown out at 2B. Collins will reprise
his record on the 22nd.

1913
The contending Cleveland Naps, lose their 4th in a row to the Senators,
7-3. Washington will win tomorrow, 6-1, behind Walter Johnson, leaving the
Nats just a game behind the 2nd place Clevelanders. Today, ump Jack Egan
tosses C Steve O'Neill and manager Joe Birmingham. Tomorrow, Birmy will
be slapped with a suspension by AL head Ban Johnson, who will lift the
10-day suspension of Washington manager Clark Griffith. Besides the fight
with the ump, the Naps' slumping Joe Jackson also loses a fight with a sign
trying for Milan's line drive. Jackson leaves the game after being knocked
unconscious. He'll miss a day.

1914
At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson stops Brooklyn giving up 7 hits and the
Giants schmeer Charlie Schmutz, 3-0.

1915
Eddie Plank of the Federal League's St. Louis Terriers records his 300th
victory when he defeats the Newark Peppers, 12-5. The future Hall of Famer
(1946) is the ninth player and first southpaw to reach this milestone.

The Reds pepper Mathewson for 10 hits and Lefty George shuts out last-place
New York to win, 4-0. Lefty will pitch into the 1940's, and will set the
Eastern League record for wins (165) between 1923-33.

In a 2-0 win over Kansas City, Hal Chase of the Buffeds hits a homerun at
Kansas City's Gordon and Koppel Field, which clears the fence and lands
in Brush Creek. This is Prince Hal's 4th homer in 7 games, on his way to
a Federal League-leading 17. In ten previous big league seasons, he had
never hit more than four.

1917
Walter Johnson allows just two hits to beat Dutch Leonard to give the Nats
a 4-3 win over the Red Sox. All the runs are unearned for Boston.

Stanley Coveleski allows just three Detroit hits and Jack Graney scores
the only run as Cleveland wins, 1-0.

The Giants sweep the Robins at the Polo Grounds. New York takes the opener,
3-2, by scoring the winning run in the 10th on George Burns' inside-the-park
homer. They do it again in the nitecap, scoring two runs in the 9th to beat
Jack Coombs. Pol Perritt, with relief help in the 9th, wins.

At Wrigley Field, Military Day is celebrated by a double victory for
Chicago over the Reds, with Jimbo Vaughn credited with both wins. Vaughn
starts the opener and retires after an inning with his team ahead by three
runs. The Cubs win, 6-5, with Vic Aldridge allowing 2 runs in 5 innings,
and Carter finishing. Aldridge will eventually get credit for the win and not
Vaughn. Vaughn then goes 9 innings in the nitecap, striking out 9 to win, 5-1.

White Sox pitcher James Scott is admitted to the reserve officer's training
camp at the Presidio in San Francisco. Death Valley Jim was 6-7 this year,
his final season.

1918
In the earliest conclusion of the Fall Classic, the Red Sox win the WS in
game 6 on Carl Mays' 2nd victory, a 2-1 three-hitter. The regular season
was shortened due to World War I. With 2 on and 2 outs in the 3rd, utility
OF George Whiteman lines a hard drive to RF. Max Flack drops it, allowing
the only runs off Lefty Tyler. Righty Claude Hendrix, 20-7 during the year,
finally makes an appearance, tossing a final inning for the Cubs. Cubs
pitchers compile a 1.04 ERA, while Boston's .186 BA is the lowest ever for a
WS winner, but they compensate by making just one error, a record not beaten
this century in a 6-game WS. The Red Sox will realize $1,102 each, the Cubs
$671, the smallest winner's share since 1906. The inning-by-inning results of
the game were relayed to Fort Devans, 58 miles away, via nine homing pigeons.

1919
The Red Sox shut out the Browns for the afternoon. Herb Pennock wins the first
game, 4-0, and Allan Russell follows suit, 6-0. Boston has now won 8 in a row.

At Chicago, The Giants beat Grover Alexander, 7-3, as rookie Frankie Frisch
connects for his first ML homer. Rube Benton takes the win for New York.

Cardinals pitcher Ferdie Schupp picks a fine time to hit his only ML homer,
as he ends a game with visiting Brooklyn by hitting a 9th-inning solo shot
off Leon Cadore. The Cards win, 4-3.

1920
New York takes the final game of the series, topping Cleveland, 6-2, as
Ruth cracks two doubles. Cleveland now leads by a .001 point over New York
with the Sox a game back.

With the Reds losing twice to the Braves, the Dodgers win a pair from
the Cards to take over first place by two games. Brooklyn wins, 15-4 and
2-0. Sherry Smith fires the shutout win, hits 2 doubles and scores a run.

1921
The Giants whip Brooklyn, 11-3, behind Fred Toney in relief of Phil
Douglas. The win moves the Giants into 1st place ahead of Pittsburgh.

1922
The Browns are down 4-3 to the Tigers in the 9th, but a walk and a George
Sisler triple ties the game. Marty McManus lines a single to win it, 5-4,
for reliever Hub Pruett. Sisler falls on his shoulder in the 7th stretching
for a ball but stays in the game.

1923
After Yankee leadoff hitter Whitey Witt reaches first base on a controversial
infield hit that is ruled a single, Boston P Howard Ehmke retires the next
27 batters for a 3-0 win, his 20th of the year. The Yankee crowd exhorts the
scorer Fred Lieb to reverse his call on the hard grounder that 3B Howard
Shanks booted, but the one hit stood. Ehmke has now given up just one hit
in his last 2 games.

Minor league head M. H. Sexton fines the president of the Norfolk club
$1,000 and suspends the team indefinitely for an attack on an umpire. Barry
led the attack by fans on umpire Harper. Sexton also accused the Virginia
League president of laxity in that this is the 2nd attack on an ump in the
league this year. Since the season is closed the suspension of the team
does not affect the standings.

1926
Cleveland sweeps two from the Senators, winning 8-1 and 3-2. In the opener,
Walter Johnson serves up a two-run homer to Tris Speaker in the opening
inning.

In a last match-up in their fraternal rivalry, Brooklyn's Jesse Barnes
beats his brother and the Giants, 6-0. Jesse is 3-2 against his brother
Virgil. There won't be another brother pitching match-up until the Niekros.

1927
After losing a record 21 in a row this year to New York, the Browns win their
last meeting, 6-2, at Yankee Stadium behind Milt Gaston's 5-hitter. One
of the two runs allowed by the ex-Yankee is the Babe's 50th homer, a solo
shot in the 4th inning. No team has ever swept a 22-game season series,
though one NL team, the 1909 Braves, went 1-21 against the Cubs.

White Sox CF Johnny Mostil plays his first full game of the year going 1 for
6 in a 12-inning 6-5 loss to the Senators, the 2nd of 12 straight losses for
Chicago. Mostil has been out all season since slashing his wrists in spring
training, allegedly because his girl friend left him for his roommate Bill
Barrett. Mostil will make 13 appearances this season, playing a full game
just once more, on the last day of the year. With a 300+ lifetime average,
the fleet outfielder will not reach that mark again.

1928
In the Yankees' 5-3 win at the Stadium, Ty Cobb makes his last appearance
as a batter, popping out against Yankee Hank Johnson to SS Mark Koenig
as a pinch hitter in the 9th. 41-year-old Cobb, who is the all-time hits
leader, will announce his retirement six days from now ending a 24-year
Hall of Fame career. Babe Ruth's two-run clout, off Lefty Grove in the 8th,
seals the win for New York. The Bronx Bombers seal the fate of the A's with
their 4th straight win over the Quakers, leaving the Mackmen in 2nd place,
2 1/2 games back.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants take 2 games from the Braves, 11-6 and
7-6. Freddie Lindstrom goes 8 for 10 to pull New York into 2nd place, 2
1/2 games behind St. Louis. The Giants will continue to feast on Braves
pitching, winning doubleheaders from Boston on the 13th and the 14th to
tie the NL record for twinbills won on consecutive days.

1930
The Cubs finally score, but still lose, 2-1, to Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance,
who strikes out 13 Chicagoans. Hack Wilson's homer today is the only Cub
run in the series, while Glenn Wright's 2-run homer in the 1st is all the
Robins' scoring.

1932
Joe Schultz Jr, 14-year-old son of Houston (Texas League) manager Joe
Schultz, is inserted into a game against Galveston as a pinch hitter. He
hits a single, steals 2B and 3B, and scores a run. Fritz, the black batboy,
also bats, but is fanned by Thormahlen after trying to sacrifice.

At Cleveland, Wes Ferrell comes back from his 10-day suspension and beats
the Yankees, 5-4, for his 21st win. Rookie Johnny Allen loses and snaps
his 10-game win streak.

as the A's beat the White Sox, 8-0.

1935
The rampaging Cubs beat the lowly Braves, 15-3. Bill Lee coasts to the win.

1936
Hod Lisenbee of the Philadelphia A's ties a ML record for hits allowed,
giving up 26 in a 17-2 rout by Chicago. The 37-year-old goes all 8 innings
at Comiskey as Monte Stratton coasts to the win. Chicago is paced by the
trio of Mike Kreevich, Zeke Bonura and Luke Appling with five hits apiece,
tying the AL record. The Pale Hose tie another AL record with 4 players
notching 4+ hits. The 4-with-4 record was set on September 29, 1928 by
Detroit. Rip Radcliff has 4 hits and 4 runs and Jackie Hayes collects 3
hits. Les "Plymouth" Rock takes over for Bonura at 1B and grounds into a
DP in his only ML plate appearance. He does drive in a run, however ... the
RBI credit will be changed in 1939 so that a double play is excluded.

The Yankees win at Detroit, 14-4, using a 9-run 8th inning to bust it
open. Pat Malone is the winner, helping himself with 2 hits and 4 RBIs.

1937
The Cubs hold off the Pirates to win, 5-4, and advance to 1 1/2 games behind
the idle Giants.

1938
Free admission, bats and peanuts highlight Lefty O'Doul Day for Kids at
Seals' Stadium. Between games of the Seals and Oaks doubleheader, the kids
have a chance to scramble for autographed balls thrown by the players.

Frank Frisch is fired as Cardinals manager, and Cuban-born coach Mike
Gonzalez takes charge. The Cards then manage four hits off Bill Lee, as
the Cubs shut out the Cards.

Hank Greenberg continues his hot hitting, banging two homers off Chicago's
Ted Lyons. The Tigers sweep the Sox, winning 10-1 and 5-3.

1940
In a doubleheader, the Yankees' first-game win at Cleveland puts them atop
the AL, as Ernie Bonham beats Bob Feller, 5-3. A 2nd game loss, 5-3, aided
by Babe Dahlgren's costly error, drops them out of first, and they will
never reach first again. Joe McCarthy will hold this error against Babe,
contending that it cost them the pennant. He whispers to many that Dahlgren
is a marijuana user, and will trade him after the season. The Dahlgren family
will for years maintain that McCarthy essentially blackballed him out of the
game and defamed him, though his .253 over 5 seasons might have played a part.

The Tigers route the Red Sox, 11-7, to briefly take over first place. Three
teams will hold first place today.

At Ebbets Field, Dizzy Dean makes a triumphant return to the Cubs, setting
down the Dodgers, 3-2, in game 2. Reiser homers in the 7th against Diz,
now pitching sidearm. The Cubs win the opener, 8-5.

1941
The Dodgers collect a 3-run homer from Dolph Camilli to tie the Cards, 4-4,
in regulation. They push across two runs in the 11th on Dixie Walker's
single, and Hugh Casey, in relief of veteran Fred Fitzsimmons, picks up
the save. Brooklyn leads the Cards by 2 games.

1942
Eddie Freed of the Philadelphia Phillies collects a single, two doubles,
a triple and an intentional walk in his ML debut, a Phils team record. But
the Reds win, 8-5 in 11 innings, on Ray Lamanno's HR. The 5'6" Freed will
total only 10 hits during his brief ML career as he is drafted in January
of 1943 for three years. Only 393 fans are on hand for today's game, as
the last-place Phils will draw just 230,183 this season.

At Ebbets Field, Mort Cooper, wearing Coaker Triplett's #20 uniform,
scatters 3 hits to shut out the Dodgers, 3-0, and become the year's first
20-game winner. The shutout is his 8th of the year. The Cardinals, now just
a game in back of Brooklyn, order World Series tickets to be printed.

Before a night game crowd of 4,127, the Indians down the A's, 5-4 in 13
innings. The win goes to reliever Phil Marchildon, his 17th. Making his
debut at 2B for the Indians is 18-year-old Ted Sczepkowski, who goes 1 for 5.

1943
At the Polo Grounds, Boston's Jim Tobin serves up a homerun to Mel Ott as
the Giants win, 10-2. It is Ott's 18th and last homer of the year. All 18
have come at the Polo Grounds, second only to Gavvy Cravath's 1914 ML mark
of hitting all 19 at home.

1946
The Reds and Dodgers set a ML record by playing the longest scoreless game in
history, 19 innings, at Ebbets Field, before darkness ends it. The previous
record was 18 innings, set in 1909. The Reds' Johnny Vander Meer pitches the
first 15 innings, striking out 14, with Harry Gumbert pitching 4 innings. For
Brooklyn, Hal Gregg pitches the first 10 innings, followed by Hugh Casey
(5 innings), Art Herring (3 innings) and Hank Behrman (1 inning). Later,
the Dodgers will win the playoff, 5-3.

The Cubs and Braves battle to a 3-3 tie after 17 innings. Chicago gets 13
hits to Boston's 8, though the Braves manage just one hit over the last
12 1/3 innings. Hank Borowy, who pitched yesterday, pitches the final 7
hitless frames.

1947
Ralph Kiner hits 3 successive solo HRs for the Pittsburgh Pirates in game
1 and 4 on the afternoon to lead the Pirates to a double win over Boston,
4-3 in 13 innings, and 10-8. Despite Kiner's 3 homers, it is pitcher Kirby
Higbe's game-ending homer in the 13th that wins it. Kiner hit 2 on the
9th against the Giants' Larry Jansen, as the Pirates lose, giving him a ML
record tying 6 in 3 days. His slugging today gives him 47 and a tie with Mize.

In the start of a crucial series in St. Louis, Ralph Branca, 21, wins his
20th as the Dodgers clip the Cardinals, 4-3. The tense battle ignites after
Joe Garagiola spikes Jackie Robinson at 1B in the 2nd inning. Coming to bat
in the 3rd, Robinson has words with Garagiola ("a teeth to teeth exchange",
Time) and the two are finally separated by coach Clyde Sukeforth. It is
the first time that Robinson has reacted on the field.

1948
The Braves sweep a pair from the Phils, winning 3-1 and 13-2. Johnny Sain
wins the opener over Schoolboy Rowe, with Bob Elliott providing the offense
with a 3-run homer. Spahn wins the nitecap, hitting his first ML homer,
off Charles Bicknell. Robin Roberts is the losing pitcher. Both Boston teams
now lead their leagues by three games. For the 16th consecutive season, the
Phillies will have a losing season as the team drops its 78th game in game
2. The drought, which began in 1933, is the longest in big league history.

Ralph Kiner, benched by a stomach disorder, poles an 8th-inning pinch
grand slam to give the Pirates a 13-12 win over Chicago. It is the Bucco
belter's 39th homer. Pafko has a homer and 2 doubles, good for 5 ribbies,
to pace the Bruins.

Behind Steve Gromek and Bob Lemon, the Indians sweep two from the Browns, 4-1
and 9-1. Lemon wins his 20th, the first AL hurler to reach the mark. Cleveland
now trails the Yanks by a half-game and the Red Sox by 3 1/2.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

The Red Sox maintain their pace with a sweep of the A's, winning a day-night
twinbill, 9-1 and 2-1. Denny Galehouse and Mel Parnell toss complete games.

1949
In the first of two games at Yankee Stadium, the Senators hand out 17 base
on balls, including a ML-record 11 walks in the 3rd inning, when the Yanks
plate 12, the AL record for number of runs in a 3rd inning. Another mark is
set as four different Yankees collect 2 walks apiece in the bottom of the
3rd. The Nats hand out 13 walks in the first three innings. Buzz Dozier,
who pitches the last 5 1/3 innings, the most generous with 8 walks. Allie
Reynolds (16-4) is the benefactor in the 20-5 romp. New York takes the 2nd
game, 2-1 in 5 1/2 innings, behind Sanford, with relief help from Page.

With Musial poling 3 homers, the Cards sweep a pair from the Reds, 7-5 and
7-4, and increase their lead over the Dodgers to 1 1/2 games. Gerry Staley,
with relief help, and Howie Pollet are the winners. Kluszewski, 0 for 8,
ends his 18-game hit streak.

Cleveland drops to 4th place, 6 games in back of the lead, when the Browns
trip them, 5-4. Dale Mitchell hits his 23rd triple of the year for the Tribe,
the most since Pittsburgh's Adam Comorosky had the same number in 1930. No
one will hit 23 again this century.

1950
The Yanks move back in first with a twin win over the Senators, 5-1 and
6-2. Rookies Ford and Jensen lead the way in the opener as Whitey wins his
6th straight. Jensen has 3 hits including his first ML HR. Lopat wins his
16th in game 2.

1951
Clem Labine blanks the Reds on 2 hits as the visiting Dodgers win, 7-0. Pafko
drives in three runs on three singles.

In St. Louis, New York's Dave Koslo wins the opener of a twinbill, 10-5,
ending the Cards' 7-game win streak. Bobby Thomson has three hits and Monte
Irvin has a double and his 5th steal of home this year. He has 13 steals
overall. Leading 6-4 in the 9th, Wes Westrum breaks an 0 for 20 skein and
delivers a grand slam. The Cards win the nitecap, 4-3, behind Cliff Chambers
to leave the Giants 6 games in back of the Dodgers.

1953
At Crosley Field, Ted Kluszewski hits his 39th HR, off Robin Roberts,
to give the Reds a 6-5 win over the Phils.

Bob Porterfield, of the 5th-place Senators, becomes the AL's first 20-game
winner, beating the Indians, 4-3. He's the first 20-game winner for the
Nats since Wolff in 1945.

1954
At the Polo Grounds, Whitey Lockman of the Giants gets a pinch-hit grand
slam to beat the Redlegs, 7-5. Don Mueller hits in his 21st straight game,
duplicating Mays' streak, which ended August 20th. He'll go hitless tomorrow.

The Yanks lose to the White Sox, 6-5, dropping New York 6 1/2 out of first,
the largest deficit in Casey Stengel's years.

Again, the Dodgers go after Joe Adcock as Don Newcombe plunks the Dodgers'
nemesis on the right hand. The broken hand ends Adcock's season. The Dodgers
then win their 1st game in 6 tries against Gene Conley, 5-3, to regain 2nd
place ahead of the Braves.

1955
Red Sox outfielder Ted Williams collects his 2000th career hit in a 5-3
loss to the Yankees.

With Herm Wehmeier on the mound, after working the count full Del Crandall
belts a 2-out grand slam in the 9th inning to climax a 5-run rally and
give the Braves a 5-4 win over the Phils. It is Crandall's 3rd slam of the
season. Milwaukee takes the nitecap, 9-1, behind Humberto Robinson, whose
wildness in the final frame prevents a shutout. He hits 18-year-old bonus
baby Fred Van Dusen with a pitch in what will be Van Dusen's only ML plate
appearance. Van Dusen's career ends with an on-base percentage of 1.000,
but without a batting average.

RF Enos Slaughter of the A's plays in his 2,000th ML game, getting a pinch
single in a 4-3 victory over the Orioles.

Gerry Staley from the Reds for the waiver price.

1956
Yogi Berra ties the ML career record for HRs by a catcher in the Yankees'
9-5 victory over Kansas City. His 236th - and the Yankees' 177th of the
season - tie him with Cub great Gabby Hartnett. Hank Bauer hits a leadoff
homer; he'll do it again tomorrow to tie a ML mark.

Frank Robinson ties the NL record for HRs by a rookie with 38 in an 11-5
Redlegs win over New York. Ed Bailey hits a 3rd-inning grand slam, off Joe
Margoneri, for the Reds.

1958
Orioles manager Paul Richards lists 3 pitchers in his starting line-up,
hoping for a scoring chance in the first inning, at which point he can
remove the extra pitchers for a batter of his choice. O'Dell, batting 9th
at P; Harshman in CF, batting 5th; Pappas at 2B, batting 7th. Only O'Dell
bats as he goes to 14-11, losing to KC's Ned Garver, 7-1. The A's plate 5
in the 8th, paced by Bob Cerv's 33rd HR.

1959
The Orioles whitewash the White Sox twice, 3-0 and 1-0. Jack Fisher and
Jerry Walker, 20-year-olds, hurl the shutouts. In the nitecap, Walker throws
16 shutout innings before a Brooks Robinson single drives in the winning
run. Walker is the 7th and last pitcher this decade to throw 16 innings
... Billy Pierce last month was the 6th.

The Phillies' Robin Roberts beats the Giants, 1-0, on a 3-hitter. Roberts
also gains revenge on Willie McCovey by ending McCovey's consecutive-game
hitting streak at 22 games. Phils CF Richie Ashburn holds the rookie record
of 23 games.

Los Angeles defeats Pittsburgh and Elroy Face, 5-4. It is Face's first loss
after 22 straight wins, 17 of them in 1959. The winner is Chuck Churn (2-0)
and the loss is Face's 1st to the Dodgers since September of 1956. His last

record. Churn will have only three major league career victories.

1963

Whitey Ford tops the host A's, 8-2, as Mantle's homer in the first provides
all the scoring Whitey needs. Mantle is 3 for 4 with 4 RBIs.

At Crosley Field, the Reds score 9 runs in the 4th enroute to a 14-3 thrashing
of the Braves. Don Pavletich, batting 6th, hits a 2-run homer in the big
inning as the Reds bat around. The bases are loaded when it's his turn to bat
again, but he's lifted for pinch hitter Gordy Coleman, who belts a grand slam.

1964
The Phils' Dennis Bennett stops the Giants, 1-0, defeating Juan
Marichal. Ruben Amaro's double scores the lone run and keeps the Phils 6

in Boston. But he is the only Angel connecting as Bill Monbouquette shuts
out the Haloes, 3-0.

After rookie Wally Bunker (16-4) gives the Orioles a 5-2 win, KC's bonus
baby Blue Moon Odom stops the O's, 8-0, on 2 hits. The split shaves the
Orioles lead to a half-game over the White Sox.

At Milwaukee's County Stadium, in a pitching duel between the Braves'
Denny Lemaster and the Reds' Jim Maloney, Milwaukee scores a run in the

and scores after a double steal and a sac fly by Felipe Alou. Leo Cardenas
has the only hit off Lemaster.

1965
Tony Cloninger's one-hit 9-0 win is Milwaukee's 2nd straight one-hitter
against the Mets, tying a ML mark set 48 years ago. Wade Blasingame, Billy

today's win, Aaron has two hits, a stolen base, a RBI and a run scored
before leaving for pinch hitter John Blanchard.

1966
Braves pitcher Pat Jarvis becomes the first of Nolan Ryan's 5,714 career
strikeouts.

John Miller becomes the first Yankee to ever to hit a homer in his first ML
at-bat. He contributes 2 runs in a 4-2 defeat of the Red Sox at Fenway. It
will be Miller's only homer in pinstripes, but as a Dodger in 1969, he will
hit a homer in his last ML at-bat.

Los Angeles regains first place, winning 4-0 and 1-0, behind Sandy Koufax
and Larry Miller while Houston suffers its 3rd and 4th consecutive shutouts
against the Dodgers.

defeating Chicago, 11-10, at the Astrodome.

1968
New York's Jim McAndrew finally wins one, beating the Cubs, 1-0, on 2
hits. It is Fergie Jenkins' (17-14) 5th 1-0 loss of the season, which ties
a ML record. Despite the loss, Jenkins will win 20 for the 2nd straight
year, using a club record-tying 40 starts to do it. Alexander, in 1920,
had 40 starts. Jenkins will finish the season with a 20-15 record, but is
20-6 in games in which his team scores a run.

1969
The Cubs take a 1-0 lead into the 3rd inning against the Phils when, with
a 3-2 count on Dick Allen and runners on 1st and 2nd, pitcher Dick Selma
unexpectedly throws to 3B instead of to home. The throw sails over the
head of a surprised Ron Santo and the Phils' Tony Taylor scores the tying
run. Selma and Santo had practiced the move in spring training, but had
never used it during the season. The Phils go on to win again over Chicago.

1970
Twenty-one-year-old Vida Blue, recalled from the minors just 8 days earlier,
hurls a one-hit shutout as the A's beat the Royals, 3-0. Pat Kelly's
8th-inning single is the only hit off the fireballing lefty.

Sonny Siebert and Jim Palmer each pitch 12 innings, but Eddie Watt gets the

double in the 8th inning to drive in 3 runs. Ken Griffey's 3-run homer in
the 4th off Don Sutton starts the Reds' scoring. The Reds push their lead
to 4 games over LA in the NL West.

1974
At Shea Stadium, the Mets lose a marathon night game after 7 hours 4
minutes, and 25 innings, the longest game to a decision in ML history.
Cardinal Ken Reitz' two-strike two-out homerun ties the game in the ninth and
sends it into extra innings. Five hours later, two Mets errors lead to the
Cardinals' winning run starting with an errant pickoff throw by Hank Webb
that allows Bake McBride to scamper all the way around from 1B. St. Louis
wins, 4-3. The Mets go to the plate 103 times, the only time the century
mark has been reached in a ML game; the Cards are not far behind with 99
plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats are recorded,
with a ML-record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans are on hand when
the game ends at 3:13 A.M.

The Phils top the Pirates, 5-3, to cut Pittsburgh's NL East lead to 2 1/2
games. A line drive by Willie Montanez fractures the hand of Pirate P Dock
Ellis, who will miss the rest of the season. Ellis is 12-9.

1976
Minnie Minoso comes to bat for the White Sox after a 12-year hiatus. He
goes hitless in his 3 at-bats against Frank Tanana, but his appearance makes
him one of a handful of ML players to play in 4 decades. His at-bat in 1980
will match him with Nick Altrock as a 5-decade player. California wins, 7-3.

1977
In Atlanta, the Braves pull off a triple steal in beating the Padres,
7-3. The thieves are Gary Mathews, Biff Pocaroba and Pat Rockett.

1979

good in the NL West. Dave Concepcion and George Foster hit back-to-back
homers in the 7th, good for 3 runs and a Reds' lead.

1980
In a 6-5 win over the Cubs, Montreal's Ron LeFlore steals his 91st base of

and widen their NL West lead over the 2nd-place Braves to 3 games.

1984
At Baltimore, the Tigers cut their magic number to 7 with a 9-2 clipping
of the Orioles. Darrell Evans has 4 hits including a homer. Larry Herndon
follows Evans' homer with one of his own, while Kirk Gibson has 3 hits and
his 27th steal. Dan Petry wins his 17th. The Tigers pass the two million
mark in road attendance tonight and become the fifth team in AL history to
go over that mark at home and on the road.

1985
Reds player-manager Pete Rose becomes baseball's all-time hit leader,
singling to left center off Eric Show in the first inning of the Reds' 2-0
win over San Diego. His 4,192nd career hit breaks Ty Cobb's record before
47,237 fans at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium. Rose had tied the record at
Wrigley Field on September 8th with a single off the Cubs' Reggie Patterson
in a game that was later suspended due to darkness, enabling Rose to break
the record at home.

John Tudor allows 3 hits in 10 innings for his 3rd consecutive shutout,
outdueling Dwight Gooden and the Mets, 1-0, to move St. Louis back into a
first-place tie with New York in the NL East. Cesar Cedeno's 10th-inning
homer provides the game's only run.

games. New York now trails first-place Toronto by 2 1/2 games in the AL East.

1987
Howard Johnson steals his 30th base of the season in the Mets' 6-4 10-inning
loss to the Cardinals, becoming the 8th player ever to hit 30 HRs and steal
30 bases in a season. Mets starter Ron Darling tears ligaments in his thumb
while fielding a Vince Coleman bunt during the game and will miss the rest
of the season.

Detroit's Tom Brooken homers in the 5th off Ted Higuera, snapping the Brewer
pitchers' scoreless streak of 32 innings. Higuera's mark tops Ray Searage's
team record of 30 innings (August 26, 1984 - April 19, 1985). The Brewers
rally for 4 runs in the 8th to top the Tigers.

At County Stadium, the Texas Rangers beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 7-1. In the
9th the umps check Ranger reliever Dale Mohorcic but can find no evidence
of sandpaper that he is using to scuff balls. Tomorrow Mohorcic will go on
the 15 day DL with gastrointestinal bleeding caused by the item he swallowed
before the umpire's inspection.

1988
The Yankees edge the Tigers, 5-4 in 18 innings. Steve Shields gets the win
in relief when Claudell Washington homers. Rickey Henderson ties a 1948 AL
record for extra innings with 12 putouts in LF.

1990
New York beats Texas, 5-4, to snap pitcher Bobby Witt's personal 12-game
winning streak. The Yanks score 2 in both the 7th and 8th innings to come
from behind. Dave Righetti saves his 31st.

Coming off his first ML start where he threw 7 shutout innings, Mel
Stottlemyre Jr is roughed up by visiting Toronto, allowing 5 runs in 3
frames. The Jays win, 8-4, handing Mel his only ML decision in this, his
last ML appearance. Tomorrow, he can console his brother Todd, who allows
6 runs in 5 innings in losing to the Royals, 7-5.

1991
At Jack Murphy Stadium, Atlanta's Kent Mercker, Mark Wohlers and Alejandro
Pena combine to toss a 1-0 no-hitter against San Diego. It is only the second

over the same Padres. It is also the first combined no-hitter in National
League history.

1992
The O's Mike Mussina (15-5) bests the Brewers' Bill Wegman, 3-2, as both
pitchers go the distance. Cal Ripken twists his ankle running out a 2B,
but stays in the game. The O's will recall SS Manny Alexander, but Ripken
keeps the streak going.

1995
At Jacobs Field, the Yankees record a rarity in their 4-0 win over the
Indians - no assists. Jack McDowell allows 4 hits, walks 4 and strikes out 8
in the 9 innings as the Yanks register the 3rd no-assist game in the AL this
century. Black Jack retires the side in the 9th on 3 pitches. The outfield
makes 8 of the 27 putouts. It last happened in the ML in a Mets-Phils game
on June 25, 1989, the only time in the NL.

1996
After hitting a homerun off right-hander Francisco Cordova earlier in
the game, Ken Caminiti goes deep in the bottom of the seventh inning off
southpaw Matt Ruebel. It's the fourth time this season the Padres' third
baseman has homered from both sides of the plate in a game which establishes
a new major league mark. He breaks his own major league record he set last
year when he accomplished the feat three times.

1997
At Shea Stadium, John Olerud cycles, going 4 for 5 with 5 ribbies, to lead
the Mets to a 9-5 win over the Expos. Olerud hits a bases loaded stand-up
triple in the 8th, his first triple in 3 years, to complete the cycle. The
drive bounces off the wall, striking center fielder Vladimir Guerrero.

1998
Kevin Malone replaces Tommy Lasorda as general manager who is promoted to
Senior Vice President. Malone had been assistant GM with the Orioles for
the past 2 years.

At Turner Field, the Florida Marlins lose to the Atlanta Braves, 8-2,
to become the 1st WS champion in history to lose 100 games the next
season. Former Atlanta Braves pitcher Larry Bradford, there for a pre-game
cermeny with a Little League team, dies of a sudden heart attack before
the game. The 'Fish' have the worst record in baseball, 48-100.

The Cubs lose to Milwaukee, 13-11, with Sammy Sosa hitting HR #59 in the
losing effort.

Kansas City's Kevin Appier makes his first start of the season, stopping
the Mariners, 8-5. It is exactly one year since Appier's last start,
at Anaheim. Since then he's had two operations and been hospitalized with
colon inflammation. His two strikeouts today put him in a tie for the career
club record.

1999
The Twins defeat the Angels, 7-0, as Eric Milton hurls the 3rd no-hitter
of the season. The young lefthander fans 13 and allows just 2 walks in
his masterpiece. There are just 11,222 fans to see the game, the third
smallest crowd to witness a no-hitter in the majors since 1986. The 11:05
A.M. start time is to accommodate a University of Minnesota football game
at the Metrodome and the Twins offer free admission to anyone attending
the game in their pajamas.

The Athletics defeat the Devil Rays, 5-4, as Doug Jones records the 300th
save of his career.

The Astros defeat the Cubs, 5-3, as Jose Lima becomes the 1st 20-game winner

a precautionary measure.

2002
At Yankee Stadium the Yankees remember the tragedy of last year with a
special monument unveiled by Yankee legends Whitey Ford and Phil Rizzuto in
Monument Park memorializing those killed as part of the 50-minute pregame
ceremony. The team also has a ceremonial tree planting in Monument Park
in honor of the heroes and victims of horrific events of a year ago. The
Orioles wear 5-sided patches honoring the victims of the attack on the
Pentagon. The game goes 11 innings, before Nick Johnson ends it with an
RBI single. The Yankees win, 5-4, despite striking out 14 times. Orlando
Hernandez issues a walk in the 8th when he goes to his mouth on a 3-2
count while standing on the mound. It was the first walk in 6 full games
(65 innings) by a Yankee pitcher, the longest streak since WW2, according
to the Elias Sports Bureau. Steve Karsay later hands out another walk.

The Mets and Braves split a doubleheader, with Atlanta winning the 1st game,
8-5, and New York taking the nightcap, 5-0. John Smoltz gets the save in
the opener, making him the 7th pitcher in history to record 50 saves in
a season. Smoltz will set the NL season saves record with 55, topping the
old mark of 53 shared by Randy Myers and Trevor Hoffman. Chicago's Bobby
Thigpen set the major league record of 57 in 1990.

2003
The White Sox release P Jose Paniagua. Paniagua pitched in only one game
for the White Sox, but gave up 4 runs in 1/3 IP, and made an obscene gesture
to the home plate umpire while walking off the field.

Seattle tops Texas, 8-2, behind 8 strong innings from Gil Meche
(15-10). According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Meche is the first pitcher

two seasons.

2004
As 36,887 Bank One Ballpark fans hope to see Barry Bonds hit his 699th
and perhaps 700th career homer, they watch the Giant left fielder reach

balls from Diamondback pitchers to break his own record and become the
first major leaguer to walk over 200 times in a single season.

The Phillies defeat the Mets in 13 innings by a score of 11-9. The teams
combine to use a ML-record 18 pitchers in the contest, 10 by the Phillies
to tie a NL mark.

Texas beats Toronto, 10-7, despite the Jays hitting two pinch homeruns in
the 8th inning. Eric Hinske and Chris Gomez hit the pinch homers, the latter
hitting his off Ron Mahay, who gets one out and the win. Mark Teixeira has
a 3-run homer for Texas.

in 7 runs for Florida, while Dan Uggla has 5 hits. Carlos Delgado hits his
40th homer of the year for New York.

2008
Jack Cust whiffs in his first two plate appearances and K's again in the
eighth inning to bring his strikeout total this season to 176. The A's
outfielder/DH breaks the franchise record previously held by Jose Canseco
who fanned 175 times in 1986.

With his sixth-inning double in the 3-2 loss to the Cubs, Cardinals first
baseman Albert Pujols becomes only the third player in history to drive
in 100 runs during his first eight major league seasons. The two other big
leaguers to reach the plataeu are Red sox outfielder Ted Williams, who also
accomplished the feat for eight seasons from 1939-42, 46-49, and starting
in 1924, fly-chaser Al Simmons did it for 11 years playing for the A's (9)
and the White Sox (2).

2009
Prior to the start of the eighth inning at Comerica Park, a small boy races
to the pitcher's mound and grabs a baseball intended for Tigers reliever
Brandon Lyon. The youngster is helped back into the stands near the visitors'
dugout and is allowed to keep the ball after a discussion between the boy's
uncle and ballpark security reveals that the six-year-old had misunderstood
a suggestion to go to the railing to try to get a ball from one of the Blue
Jay players.

With an opposite-field single in the third inning of a 10-4 loss to Baltimore
on a rainy New York night, Derek Jeter becomes the all-time team leader in
hits for the historic franchise. The safety gives the Yankees captain 2,722
hits, one more than legendary Lou Gehrig, another 35-year-old team captain,
who had held the record for more than 70 years.

2010
With MLB's permission, Pete Rose goes on the Great American Ball Park field
for the celebration of his record-breaking hit that passed Ty Cobb making
him the all-time leader. The banished player is joined by former teammates,
including Tony Perez and Cesar Geronimo, and Reds owner Bob Castellini,
who gives him a trophy commemorating the 25th anniversary of the historic
4,192th hit.

Jim Thome connects for career homer No. 587 to pass Hall of Famer Frank
Robinson for eighth place on the all-time career list. The Twins DH's historic
round-tripper, which he blasts in the top of the twelfth inning at Progressive
Field, is the lone run scored in Minnesota's 1-0 victory over Cleveland.

For the 10th consecutive campaign, starting with his rookie year, Albert
Pujols drives in 100 or more runs. Only Al Simmons, with 11, has more
seasons with 100 RBIs to start a career than the Cardinals' first baseman.

2011
The Mets' request to wear caps honoring police, firefighters and other first
responders for their September 11th game against Chicago is denied by Major
League Baseball. The hats, which were worn during the pre-game ceremony of
remembrance, will be autographed and sold on Mets.com with the proceeds to
be given to charities through the Mets' foundation.

2013
At Marlins Park, benches clear when Brian McCann confronts Jose Fernandez as
the Miami starting pitcher crosses home plate after hitting his first career
homerun. The Braves' backstop and third baseman Chris Johnson take exception
to the 21-year-old rookie right-hander admiring the homerun from the batter
box then glaring into the Atlanta dugout as he was rounding the bases.

2018
Juan Soto of Washington, with his multi-homer game against the Philadelphia
Phillies, became the first teenager in Major League history to have three
multi-homer games in a season.

Trevor Story of Colorado, with his first-inning double against the Arizona
Diamondbacks, became the first shortstop in National League history to
amass 30+ homeruns, 40+ doubles and drive in more than 100 runs in a season.

Against the Miami Marlins, Jacob deGrom of the Mets allowed two runs in
seven innings of work. This was his 26th consecutive start of allowing
three or fewer runs, setting a new Major League record. The old record was
set by Leslie "King" Cole in 1910.
