1901
Pitching for Dayton (Western Assoc) Clarence Wright hurls his second
consecutive no-hitter, beating Grand Rapids, 2-0. On September 1, Wright
beat Columbus, 9-0, allowing no hits.

1902
Dave Fultz steals 2B, 3B and home in the 2nd inning against Detroit, as
the A's romp, 13-3.

Chicago Cubs rookie Alex Hardy debuts with a 1-0 shutout victory over
Brooklyn, and becomes the first 20th century NL pitcher to toss a shutout
in his first game. It's happened twice already in the AL.

1905
In a rain-delayed doubleheader, the Giants trip the Phillies twice, 7-1
and 11-6. The opener doesn't start till 3:00 P.M. but Joe McGinnity wins
easily. Mathewson wins his 25th in the nitecap, despite spotting the Phils
5 runs in the 2nd inning. The Phillies match the gift in the 5th and 7th
innings.

1906
The Highlanders win their 5th doubleheader (in 6 days) in a row - a record
- as they tally a double shutout of Boston, 7-0 and 1-0. Their win streak
will go through September 8 and will stretch to 15 victories, propelling
New York to a 1 1/2 game lead in the AL.

1907
For his 32nd birthday tomorrow, Cleveland fans give manager Nap Lajoie a
wagon load of gifts, including a live black sheep. The Naps then hand their
captain another gift, a 6-5 win over Detroit.

1908
In a game, the significance of which will not be recognized for another
3 weeks, the Pirates and Cubs are tied 0-0 in the last of the 10th at
Pittsburgh. With 2 outs and the bases loaded, Pittsburgh's Owen Wilson
singles to CF, scoring Fred Clarke with the winning run. Warren Gill, on
1B, does not get to 2B but stops short, turns, and heads for the dugout,
a common practice. The Cubs' Johnny Evers calls for the ball from Jimmy
Slagle, touches 2B, and claims the run does not count as Gill has been
forced. The lone umpire, Hank O'Day, has left the field. When queried, he
rules that Clarke had already scored, so the run counts. The Cubs protest
to league president Pulliam, but are denied. This is the first time the
Cubs try this tactic, but not the last.

The Giants sweep two more from the Doves, beating Boston, 3-0 and 8-5. Joe
McGinnity wins the first game, while 3 pitchers combine for the 2nd win. Red
Ames is the victor.

In New York, Walter Johnson opens a series against New York by besting Jack
Chesbro, 3-0, allowing 6 hits in the Washington win.

In the nitecap of a twinbill in Boston, Frank Arellanes tosses a one hitter
and the Red Sox collect 13 hits to defeat the A's, 10-1. Light-hitting Simon
Nicholls clubs his 4th homer of the year for the only A's hit. Boston takes
the opener as well, 7-1.

1911
Against the Braves, the Giants' Rube Marquard strikes out 14 batters in
the 1st 7 innings, but runs out of gas in the 8th and loses, 8-7.

1913
In his major league debut at Sportsman Park in St. Louis, southpaw Hal
Schwenk pitches 11 innings giving up 12 hits, but earns a complete-game
victory beating the White Sox, 5-4. The Browns rookie will never again
appear in a big league game.

Cleveland lefty Vean Gregg strikes out Ty Cobb three times in a row, but
Cobb doubles in the winning run in the 12th as the Tigers prevail, 4-3.

1915
Pittsburgh's Erv Kantlehner loses to the Cubs, 5-2, but at least his teammates
give him a pair. He will go 6-12 this year, with 8 of his losses by shutouts.

1916
To help draw a Labor Day crowd, and because of their longtime rivalry,
Christy Mathewson and Three Finger Brown agree to close out their careers
in the same game. Matty, now the manager of the Reds, wins 10-8 in his only
game not pitched in a Giants uniform. Mathewson and Brown dueled 25 times
since 1903, with Brown, now back with the Cubs, winning 13 and losing 10;
Matty is 11-13. Both pitchers stagger to the end today in the nitecap of a
twinbill, with the Reds racking up 19 hits, 3 by Matty, off Brown, while
the Cubs tally 15 off Mathewson, 2 hits by Brown. Vic Saier hits a 3-run
HR off Matty, the 5th time he has hit a 4-bagger off him, the most Matty
has given up to any one hitter. The Cubs score 3 in the 9th before Matty
gets Fritz Mollwitz, representing the tying run, to pop out. Today's win
is number 373 for Mathewson. The Cubs win the A.M. contest, 3-0.

In Detroit, the Coveleski brothers appear together in the same game for the
only time in their careers. Stan starts for the Indians and gets knocked
out in Detroit's 5-run first inning. Harry relieves later on in the game
as Detroit wins, 7-5.

In a double shutout, Pirates Frank Miller and Wilbur Cooper shut out the
Cardinals, 7-0 and 2-0.

At New York, the Yankees and Red Sox split. Boston wins the opener, 7-1,
behind Babe Ruth, while New York scores in the 9th to win the nitecap, 4-3.

1917
The Phillies' Joe Oeschger and Brooklyn's Jeff Pfeffer face off to a 14-inning
scoreless tie. Pfeffer gives up just 3 hits, while Oeschger allows just 6.

The rampaging White Sox use an 8-run 8th inning to beat the Browns, 13-6. Red
Faber is the winner over reliever Tom Rogers.

The Yankees split a pair with Boston, losing 4-2 to Babe Ruth in the opener,
then beating Carl Mays, 7-3. Ruth allows no hits until the 6th inning and
just 5 hits overall.

1918
Rain delays the start of Wednesday's World Series opener.

Pirate minor league pitcher Marcus Milligan is killed in a fall from an
Army airplane in Ft. Worth Texas. Milligan had enlisted last December.

1920
Eddie Collins has 2 hits in the nitecap against the Browns, as the White
Sox win, 5-2. Collins has hit safely since August 21, and will ring up a
22-game hitting streak through September 13.

In Boston, 33,000 are on hand for a doubleheader and to see Ruth return
to the Yankee lineup. The Babe hits his 45th in the opener to give New
York a 5-3 win. In the nitecap, Carl Mays pitches to a mixture of boos and
cheers. Mays takes a 5-3 lead into the 9th, then he fails to back up home
on a play at the plate. A loose ball allows Joe Bush to score the winning
run and Boston wins, 6-5.

Brooklyn's Leon Cadore gives up 12 hits but coasts to a 10-0 shutout over
the Braves.

1922
At the start of the day, both New York teams are on top, and both Boston
teams are on the bottom. But today, the Red Sox will take 2 and knock the
leaders off their perch as they sweep the Yankees, 4-3 and 6-5. Babe Ruth
hits his last regular season HR, in the Polo Grounds. He gets it off Herb
Pennock, who also gave up Ruth's first Yankee homer, also at the Polo Grounds.

At home, the Browns win decisively, beating the Indians, 10-3 and 13-2. Urban
Shocker wins his 23rd in the morning and Ken Williams hits his 33rd. Sisler
is 4 for 4 in the opener and 3 for 5 in game 2 to run his hit streak to 34
straight games. Vangilder is the winner in the nitecap.

1923
At Shibe Park, Yankee Sam Jones no-hits the Athletics, 2-0, beating Bob
Hasty. Babe Ruth makes the only strikeout of the game as he slips a point
behind Detroit's Harry Heilmann in the batting race. Not till Ken Holtzman's
no-hitter in 1969, will another pitcher record a no-hitter with no strikeouts.

In a twilight charity game, Ruth plays 1B for Philadelphia's Ascension
Catholic Club. Ruth scores the only run in a 2-1 loss to the Lit Brothers.

1924
Dazzy Vance chalks up his 12th straight win, and 24th on the year, beating
the Braves, 5-1, and striking out 11. It's also the Robins' 12th straight
win. Dutch Ruether then wins the nitecap, 9-1, giving Brooklyn a NL-record
four doubleheader sweeps in four days. The Phils were swept for six straight
on September 1, 2 and 3.

1926
The Reds take first place by beating the Cards, 5-0. Pete Donohue beats
Wee Willie Sherdel. Tomorrow the teams will reverse positions again when
the Cards win, 7-3.

1927
At Philadelphia, Babe Ruth hits his 44th homer of the season, and the 400th
of his career, off Rube Walberg. The Yankees cruise to a win, 11-2.

In a ML first, Paul and Lloyd Waner hit homers for first-place Pittsburgh in
the 5th inning at Cincinnati's Redland Field, and both are "bounce home runs"
- fair balls that bounce into the stands are HRs in the NL until 1930. Paul
leads off with a slice down the short LF line for a bounce homer, and then
Clyde Barnhart makes an out. Brother Lloyd then slices one almost exactly
in the same spot as his brother's drive, the first time in history that two
brothers have homered in the same inning or game. The Pirates beat the Reds'
Dolf Luque, 8-4, opening a 2-game lead in the NL.

1928
With yesterday's Labor Day DH rained out, the Braves will play a record 9
consecutive doubleheaders between now and the 15th:  Brooklyn today and the
5th; Philadelphia on the 7th and 8th; New York on the 10th, 11th, 13th,
and 14th; and the Cubs on the 15th. Starting with the Phils on the 8th,
they will lose 5 of them in a row - a record, including all four to the
Giants. They start the streak by dropping both games today to Brooklyn ... the
Robins win the opener, 3-2, behind Jake Flowers' 10th-inning homer for Dazzy
Vance's 19th win and Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 9-2, as Babe Herman and
Del Bissonette wallop 4th-inning homers. Boston will go 4-14 for the 9 DHs.

1930
Rogers Hornsby returns to the Chicago lineup as the Cubs beat the Pirates,
10-7, in 10 innings. Jesse Petty, purchased from the Bucs on August 24th,
picks up the victory, the last one of his career. Hornsby had been absent
since Memorial Day because of a broken ankle. The Cubs are in first place,
but the Cards, after thrashing the Reds, 13-2, move into a tie for 2nd
place with the Giants. The Giants lose to the Braves, 7-1.

1933
In a Labor Day twin bill, Joe Hauser of Minneapolis (AA), hits 3 HRs to
reach 65, a new professional record.

1934
The Phillies release former MVP Hack Wilson, just 34-years-old. He'll finish
his career next year with Albany (International League) hitting .263.

1935
The 3rd-place Cubs get 2 HRs, including a grand slam, from Augie Galan
to beat the Phillies at Wrigley Field. Larry French is the winner, 8-2,
for his 13th victory.

The Cards score 4 in the 8th, then Dizzy Dean picks up a save in the 9th
to beat the Braves, 5-3. Jess Haines, who fails for the 11th time to win
his 200th game, is lifted after 7 for Bill Walker who promptly tees up
Wally Berger's 30th homer of the year. Walker gives up two hits but is the
winning pitcher.

Carl Hubbell subdues the Reds, 6-4, for his 20th win of the season. King
Carl scatters 12 hits including three apiece by Cuyler and Riggs. Dick
Bartell gets three hits for the Terrymen, who remain two in back of the Cards.

Babe Ruth receives a lifetime pass for all National League games from NL
prexy Ford Frick.

1937
At the Polo Grounds, Carl Hubbell stops the Dodgers, 3-0. Dick Bartell's
14th homer of the year is all the scoring King Carl needs to chop up Max
Butcher. With Chicago (73-49) idle, the Giants (74-48) move in front by
a game.

Mike Kreevich of the White Sox ties a ML record with 4 consecutive doubles
as Chicago beats Detroit, 9-1.

1939
After the Labor Day games, the Reds lead the Cards by 4 games. In the AL,
the Yankees are 14 1/2 ahead.

1940
In Detroit, the Tigers get two 3-run HRs, from Campbell and Gehringer,
to again top the slumping Tribe, 11-3. Tommy Bridges and Al Benton combine
for the win.

1941
The New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-3, behind Atley Donald to
clinch the AL pennant, the earliest date in ML history. The Yankees need
only 136 games, giving them a 91-45 record. Williams is 1 for 1 with 3
walks and is hitting .411. Mississippi State prospect Boo Ferriss pitches
batting practice for the Sox.

1942
At Fenway, the Red Sox continue to roll as Bill Butland stops the Tigers,
3-0, on 4 hits. It is Boston's 22nd win in 25 games and they've cut the
Yankee lead from 13 to 7 1/2 games.

1943
At Brooklyn, the Dodgers edge the Giants, 4-3, in 17 innings, scoring when
second baseman Mickey Witek throws wildly to 1B on a DP ball.

At St. Louis, the Cardinals increase their NL lead to 14 1/2 games beating the
Cincinnati Reds, 2-1, in 10 innings. A triple by Stan Musial, his 4th hit of
the game, drives in the winning run. Howie Krist is the winner over Joe Beggs.

1944
The Yankees move past St. Louis and Detroit by bombing the A's, 10-0 and
14-0. Two rookies are winners, Monk Dubiel in the opener and Mel Queen in the
nitecap. Queen has a double and 2 singles in the opener and George Stirnweiss
has a steal in each game to run his total to 49. Bobo Newsom takes the loss
in the opener while Luke Hamlin gives up 19 hits in a complete game loss
in game 2. It's the first time since May 31st that the Yanks have been in
1st. The Red Sox are in 4th place, 3 games behind.

1945
Long-time Yankee batting practice pitcher Paul Schreiber, 43, who last pitched
in the ML in 1923 and the minors in 1931, relieves for the Yankees against
Detroit in a Tiger rout. Schreiber gives up no hits in 3 1/3 innings, but
the Tigers and Dizzy Trout win, 10-0. The 22 years between ML appearances
is a ML record. Schreiber will pitch again on the 8th when, in an 11-4 loss
to Detroit, he gives up 4 hits and 2 earned runs in a one-inning appearance.

1948
Phils vet Schoolboy Rowe outpitches Bill Voiselle to beat the Braves,
4-3. In the nitecap Vern Bickford drives in two runs and pitches the Braves
to an 8-1 win.

In a Northern League game, Ken Vangilder, pitching for St. Cloud, tosses a
10-inning no-hitter against Superior. Vangilder strikes out 12, walks four
while only two of the putouts are by the outfield. He wins, 1-0.

1949
At Philadelphia, the Phils battle back into 3rd place by taking two from
the Braves, 9-8 and 8-7. The Braves take an 8-5 lead in the opener on
Tommy Holmes' 2-run homer in the 5th, and Ennis matches him to start the
comeback. Between August 3 (2) and today, Holmes has hit 10 homers without
striking out.

The Yankees sign Hugh Casey, who was released by the Pirates in early August.

Former Mexican Leaguers Lanier and Martin, each go the route as the Cards
sweep a pair from the Reds, 6-4 and 11-2, and increase their lead over the
Dodgers to 2 1/2 games. The nitecap is a replay of yesterday's 15-inning
marathon which ended 9-9. The Cards plate 8 runs in the 4th inning of game 2,
highlighted by Glaviano's grand slam.

1950
Giant hurlers Jim Hearn and Sal Maglie hurl twin shutouts over the Phils,
winning 2-0 and 9-0. Coupled with a shutout loss to the Giants yesterday,
the Phils have not scored in 3 games at home.

Reds OF Johnny Wyrostek drives in 8 runs in a doubleheader sweep of the
visiting Cardinals, 5-4 and 8-4.

Don Bessent of LaGrange (Georgia-Alabama League) pitches a 14-0 playoff
no-hitter over Carrollton.

1952
Mike Garcia notches his 18th win, stopping the Tigers, 2-0 on 5 hits. Luke
Easter belts his 25th homer to help keep the Indians 3 1/2 games in back
of the Yankees.

The Yanks sign vet Charlie Keller for the remainder of the season, but
they don't need him today as they crush the A's, 12-2. Gil McDougald has
two homers and the Yanks chase Shantz with 7 runs in the 7th. The lefty was
trying for his 23rd win. Chief Reynolds wins his 17th, spoiling Chief Bender
night at Shibe Park. The former A's ace receives a check for $6,000, gifts,
and a scroll with 150,000 names. On hand are former teammates Frank Baker,
Rube Oldring, Lena Blackburne and Ira Thomas.

Stu Miller, who debuted with a 1-0 win over the Cubs August 12, repeats
his performance against Chicago. Again, it is Schoendienst scoring the only
run. Warren Hacker is the unfortunate loser.

1953
Despite consecutive homers by Wes Westrum, Al Corwin and Whitey Lockman in the
3rd, the Giants lose to the Dodgers, 8-6, in a game marred by beanballs and
disagreements on calls. Following a Clem Labine brushback on Giants IF Bobby
Hofman, Larry Jansen throws at Duke Snider and Roy Campanella in the 8th.

1955
Mickey Mantle's first-inning 3-run HR allows Bob Turley to coast to an 8-3
win over Washington. Pedro Ramos is the losing pitcher.

After hitting a 3-run HR in the 1st, Phils C Stan Lopata collapses in the
dugout. The Giants win, 7-4. Lopata's collapse is believed to be a delayed
reaction to a beaning he received on September 2 against the Giants. He'll
return to action on the 9th.

1958
At the Coliseum, the Giants score 8 in the 1st inning off Johnny Podres,
and Stu Miller then coasts to a 13-3 win. The Giants take the season series
from the Dodgers, 16-6.

1960
After a ML-record 798 consecutive games at 2B, the White Sox' Nellie Fox
is hospitalized with a virus. Fox would have gone 1,072 straight games
had manager Marty Marion not rested him on August 5, 1955. Billy Goodman
replaces Fox as the Sox split a doubleheader with the Tigers, losing 6-4
before winning 5-4.

After 30 straight scoreless innings, the Yankees finally score but the
Orioles extend their win streak to 7 by topping New York again, 6-2. With 2
outs in the 7th, Yankee 1B Moose Skowron singles to break up Chuck Estrada's
no-hitter, but Wilhelm, in relief, preserves the win.

Woodie Held hits 2 homers and a double and drives in 6 runs to pace the
Indians to a 10-2 win over the A's. Jimmy Piersall also homers.

1961
Mantle misses the Labor Day doubleheader with a painful and swollen forearm,
but the Yanks don't need him as they sweep a pair from the Senators, 5-3 and
3-2. The sweep moves the Yanks 6 games up on the slumping Tigers, who lose
6-3 to the Orioles and trail 4-1 in a suspended game. Mantle's replacement
John Blanchard breaks a 3-3 tie in the opener with an 8th-inning homer.

After losing, 4-3, the Royals outkick the Angels, 13-7, in game 2 using an
11-run 6th inning. KC collects 7 hits, 4 walks, 3 errors and a stolen base
for their big inning. Norm Siebern and winning pitcher Joe Nuxhall homer
in the frame.

In Minnesota, the White Sox and Twins split a pair of 9-5 decisions in a
day-nite DH. Killebrew hits his 39th homer in the opener to back Schroll's
6 innings of spotty pitching. Al Smith has 4 hits and 4 ribbies in the
nitecap. Numberless rookie Joe Horlen makes his ML debut in relief and picks
up the win. The only road uniform available has no number on it (as noted
by Maxwell Kates). Horlen, a last-minute call-up, hurls four scorless innings.

At LA, Don Drysdale stops the Giants, 4-0, allowing just 2 hits. The Dodgers
are now 2 games in back of the first-place Reds.

1962
Houston finally defeats Philadelphia, 4-1, in their final meeting of the
season. The Phillies had won all 17 previous contests.

1964
The Yankees overcome two homers by Ken Harrelson to beat the host A's,
9-7, in 10 innings. Mantle and Elston Howard hit back-to-back homers in the
4th inning for New York. With the Orioles losing today, Baltimore (81-54)
and Chicago (82-55) are virtually tied for first, with New York (77-56)
three games back.

1965
At Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox sweep two from the Yankees, winning 1-0
and 7-2. Mantle's homer in the 2nd game, off Dennis Bennett, is the only
bright spot for New York. Against nemesis Dick Radatz in the 8th, Mantle
bunts foul on a two-strike pitch, the second time he's struck out bunting
against the Monster.

The Reds score 3 runs in the 9th to edge the Phillies, 5-4. Deron Johnson
drives in the last 2 runs with a single.

1966
The Dodgers become the first team to draw two million fans at home and two
million on the road as 18,670 Crosley Field patrons watch Los Angeles beat
their home town Reds, 8-6.

Chris Short shuts out the Mets, 5-0, the 5th complete game win in a row
for the Phillies' pitchers.

1967
In the opener of two, Cubs rookie Rich Nye allows no hits through 6 innings
and is one out away in the 9th from a 1-0 3-hit win when Lou Johnson homers
for the Dodgers to tie. In the 11th, Ernie Banks homers off reliever Don
Sutton to give Chicago the win. Don Sutton is now 0-7 against Chicago. Cubs
pitcher Chuck Hartenstein allows 4 hits in the 9th of the nitecap and the
Dodgers rally for 5 runs to win, 8-6.

1968
The Dodgers' Don Sutton allows just 3 hits and strikes out 12 to beat the
Phils, 3-0.

1969
After hitting in 31 straight games, the 3rd-best streak (since 1900) in NL
history, the Dodgers' Willie Davis is stopped by Dick Kelley and Gary Ross
in a 3-0 loss to San Diego. Al Ferrara drives in all 3 runs.

Down 4-1 in the 9th against the Tigers in Detroit, Baltimore gets consecutive
HRs from Frank Robinson, Boog Powell and Brooks Robinson off Earl Wilson
to tie. Timmerman then gives up the winning run on a double, sac fly,
and Baltimore chop as the O's win, 5-4.

1971
In Los Angeles, the Reds lose to the Dodgers, 2-1, and almost lose SS
Woody Woodward. A 10-pound sack of flour dropped from a passing airplane,
explodes 15 feet from where Woodward is positioned in the 9th inning.

1972
The Yankees split with the Orioles, losing 4-3 before winning 5-2. The
split leaves the Yankees (69-61) in 4th place, just one-half game out of
first place. The Orioles (69-60) are tied with Detroit for the lead. Andy
Etchebarren's 3-run homer in the first game, off Fritz Peterson, is the
big blow while the Yankees take the night cap behind just three hits,
including a homer, of Bobby Murcer.

The Cubs top the Mets, 2-0, as Fergie Jenkins posts his 19th win. The Cubs
then drop the second game, 7-2, to Gary Gentry, who strikes out 8.

Luis Tiant (10-4) pitches his 4th straight shutout, beating the Brewers, 2-0,
in the opener. Yaz' 2-run HR accounts for the scoring. The Red Sox lose the
nitecap, 6-2, as 4 former Hubmen do the damage. O'Brien and Lahoud homer,
Boomer Scott has 3 hits and Brett is the winner.

1974
Don Wilson has a no-hitter through 8 innings, but is lifted for a PH by
Houston manager Preston Gomez. Reliever Mike Cosgrove gives up a leadoff
single to Tony Perez, and the Astros lose to the Reds, 2-1. Jack Billingham,
who has a sac bunt in the 2-run 5th, is the winner. Gomez made the same
mistake in San Diego on July 21, 1970. The Reds scored both runs in the 5th
inning on 2 walks, a sac bunt and a 2-base throwing error by Roger Metzger.

The Orioles top the Red Sox, 6-0, for their 3rd straight shutout over
Boston. The Sox manage just 8 hits in the 3 games.

1976
The Reds' Pat Zachary gives up a pair of singles in the 2nd in pitching a
5-1 two-hitter against the Braves.

1978
The Pirates' Dorian Boyland has a 1-2 count in his first ML at-bat when
the Mets make a pitching change. Rennie Stennett pinch-hits, taking the 3rd
strike. The strikeout is charged to Boyland, watching the completion of his
historic AB from the bench. The Pirates sweep the doubleheader from the Mets
to move within a game of the 1st place Phils. The Bucs take the 1st game,
7-4, and then win, 7-0, behind Jim Bibby.

At Baltimore, the Orioles top the Red Sox, 4-1, behind Jim Palmer. Rookie
Bob Sprowl pitches credibly in his ML debut, but takes the loss.

Behind Ron Guidry's 20th win, the Yankees take the first game against
Detroit, 9-1. New York scores 8 in the 7th. Detroit wins the 2nd, 5-4,
to keep New York 5 games behind Boston.

1981
In the conclusion of the longest game in Fenway Park history, the Mariners
beat the Red Sox, 8-7 in 20 innings, on Joe Simpson's run-scoring triple. The
game began on September 3rd, but was suspended after 19 innings.

1982
Power beats speed as the San Francisco Giants top the St. Louis Cardinals,
5-4, on Jack Clark's 2-out 3-run homer in the 9th off Bruce Sutter. The
Cards' Lonnie Smith is 3 for 3 with 3 runs scored and 5 stolen bases.

At Baltimore, Jim Palmer one-hits the Twins, 3-0, to get his 11th consecutive
victory. The only hit is Gary Gaetti's 2-out single in the 5th inning. It
is Palmer's 2nd career one-hitter against the Twins.

1985
One day after hitting 3 homeruns in an 8-3 win over the Padres, Gary Carter
hits 2 more (solo shots) to lead the Mets to a 9-2 win at San Diego, tying
the ML record of 5 homeruns in 2 games. He is the 13th player to accomplish
the feat.

1988
Cincinnati's Danny Jackson becomes the NL's first 20-game winner by shutting
out the Cubs on 6 hits as the Reds romp, 17-0. Calvin Schiraldi is the loser.

1989
Fred Lynn hits his 300th career homerun to help the Tigers to a 5-1 win
over Kansas City.

1991
After 30 years, the asterisk attached to Roger Maris' 61 HRs in 1961
is removed by an 8-man Committee for Statistical Accuracy. Regarding
the expunging of the asterisk, historian Bill Deane later points out,
"It was an easy job ... the asterisk never existed. Maris' record was,
from 1962 until 1991, listed separately from Ruth's and was never actually
defined by 'some distinctive mark.'" The committee also defines a no-hit
game as one which ends after 9 or more innings with one team failing to
get a hit. This removes 50 games from the list that had previously been
considered no-no's, mostly shortened games, but also including Harvey Haddix'
12 perfect innings against the Braves in 1959 and Jim Maloney's 1965 1-0
loss in 11-innings. Another casualty is Ernie Shore's 27 straight outs in
1917, a game in which he relieved Ruth with a runner on and no outs in the
1st. It is now a combined no-hitter.

Lou Gehrig's 1938 Yankee road uniform brings $220,000 at a memorabilia
auction in San Francisco, becoming the most expensive non-card sports
memorabilia item ever sold. A Honus Wagner card goes for $125,500 while an
autographed Gehrig bat sells for $47,500.

Infielders Shane Turner and Tommy Shields both play all 9 positions for the
Rochester Red Wings in their season finale, an 8-0 win against Syracuse of
the Class AAA International League.

1992
Yankees OF Roberto Kelly ties a major league record by reaching base on
catcher's interference for the 7th time this year. Pittsburgh's Dale Berra
set the mark in 1983. Texas C Ivan Rodriguez is the latest victim of Kelly
in New York's 6-3 victory.

Toronto stays a half game ahead of Baltimore in the AL East by bombing the
Twins, 16-5. Toronto scores 8 runs in the 2nd to make David Cone's first win
for Toronto an easy one. Cone strikes out 6 in his 6 innings. John Olerud

Twins. Joe Carter hits his 30th homer and Candy Moldonado his 19th.

1993
Jim Abott pitches a no-hitter beating the Indians at Yankee Stadium, 4-0. In
the ninth inning, leadoff hitter Kenny Lofton is loudly booed by the fans
after he fouls off a bunt in an attempt to make the one-handed pitcher
field a ball. The Flint, Michigan native who was born without a right hand,
becomes the first Yankee in a decade to throw a no-hitter.

With their 6-5 loss to the Reds, the Phillies set a new National League
record by not being blanked in 151 straight games. The major league mark for
avoiding a shut out is 308 consecutive contests accomplished by the Yankees.

1995
Chicago 3B Robin Ventura becomes the 8th player in history to hit 2 grand
slams in a single game, doing so in the 4th and 5th innings of the White
Sox' 14-3 win over the Rangers. The last to do it was Frank Robinson in
1970. Ventura adds a double and a walk.

Toronto DH Paul Molitor strokes 5 hits and brings home 3 runs to lead
the Blue Jays to a 6-1 win over the Royals. His hits include 3 singles,
a double and a HR.

team's 4-2 loss to Las Vegas.

1996

a homerun, in a 22-2 victory over the Tigers at Briggs Stadium.

In pursuit of his 7th batting title, Tony Gwynn is 4 for 4 in the Padres'
2-1 win over the Phils. Gwynn, hitting .352, needs to average nearly 5
at-bats in the final 22 games to qualify for the batting title.

and Martinez solo in the 4th inning. The Yanks last 20-game winner was

Phillies to a 6-4 win over Montreal.

1998
The Yankees (100-38) win their 100th game of the season, defeating the
White Sox, 11-6. It is the earliest any AL team has ever reached the
100-win mark. The 1906 Cubs needed 132 games to reach the 100-win mark,
6 games fewer. Bernie Williams leads NY with a pair of homers and 4 RBIs.

Sammy Sosa's 57th HR leads the Cubs to a 5-2 win over Pittsburgh. Sosa
surpasses Hack Wilson's club record set 68 years ago.

straight times reaching base.

by hitting 9 HRs in the contest - 2 by C Eddie Taubensee and 1 apiece by
Aaron Boone, Dmitri Young, Jeffrey Hammonds, Greg Vaughn, Pokey Reese,
Brian Johnson and Mark Lewis. The 8 different players going deep is a ML
record. Chad Ogea, in 2 2/3 innings, allows 3 dingers; he has now served up
a league high 35. Stan Belinda of the Reds earns a save for Pete Harnisch
(14-8); he benefits from the rule that mandates a save be awarded if a
pitcher works three innings in relief.

The Red Sox defeat the Mariners, 4-0, as Pedro Martinez wins his 20th game,
striking out 15 batters in 8 innings of work.

2000
In the Red Sox win over the Mariners, 5-1, Carl Everett of the Sox becomes
only the sixth major-league switch-hitter to drive in 100 runs in both
leagues when he knocked in his 100th ribbie of the year. Everett drove
in 108 runs for the Houston Astros last season. The other five 100-100
switches were Ted Simmons, Ken Singleton, Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla and
J.T. Snow. Pedro Martinez is the big star, striking out 11 in 8 innings
to go 7-0 over the M's. Jamie Moyer loses his 6th in a row, though not his
fault as a routine fly ball by Jose Offerman to Mike Cameron becomes a 3-run
triple when the center fielder stumbles. Prior to the game, Boston retires
Hall of Fame C Carlton Fisk's uniform No. 27. The New Hampshire resident,
who played his first nine seasons with Boston, joins Bobby Doerr (1), Joe
Cronin (4), Carl Yastrzemski (8) and Ted Williams (9) in having his number
(27) be retired at Fenway.

The A's defeat the Blue Jays, 10-0. Mike Stanley goes 5 for 5 for Oakland,

Fish beat the Cubs, 8-2. Beckett, who was 14-1 in the minors, also adds a
double. Kevin Millar has a grand slam and Preston Wilson a 3-run homer.

The first-place Braves draw just 3,613 fans in Montreal as they beat
the Expos, 3-2. Andruw Jones hits a leadoff homer in the 9th for the
difference. The crowd is the smallest at Olympic Stadium in 17 years.

The Blue Jays roll over the sleep-walking Yankees, 14-0. Pettitte lasts
just 3 innings in losing to Chris Carpenter, who goes the distance giving
up 6 hits while striking out 11.

In the 34th World Cup, 16-year-old Taiwan pitcher Luo Chin-lung stops
Australia, 14-4. He works 5 innings, fanning 8. His performance will earn
him a $1.4 signing bonus from the Rockies. Later in the day, teammate Lee
Cheng-nan allows 2 hits over 9 frames in beating Japan. An embarrassed
Japan national team, stacked with 14 Japan League professionals, fails to
win a medal after losing to Cuba.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

2002
In front of 55,528 fans at the Coliseum, the A's set an American League

in the bottom of the ninth inning giving Oakland the historic victory, 12-11.

Aaron Myette, ejected yesterday for 2 pitches behind Mora, starts today's
game, allowing 6 of the 11 walks in an 8-3 loss to Baltimore. According to
the New York Times, it is the first back-to-back start by a pitcher since
Steve McCatty in 1980 [though 5 pitchers - Dennis Martinez (Baltimore), Bert
Blyleven (Cleveland), Pete Vuckovich (Milwaukee), Rick Langford (Oakland)
and Juan Eichelberger (San Diego) - made the last start before the 1981
strike and the first start after].

By beating the Dodgers, 7-1, Randy Johnson (20-5) wins his 20th to join
Arizona teammate Curt Schilling. The Big Unit strikes out 8 in his CG
victory. Only Sean Green's 40th homer, with 2 out in the 9th, prevents the
shutout. Matt Williams, with a 3-run homer, and Steve Finley hit back-to-back
homers off Allan Ashby in the 1st to provide Johnson with his cushion.

2003
In his first at-bat after his arrest in Pittsburgh for felony counts of sexual

the Florida fans as he approaches the batter's box as a pinch-hitter. The
Marlin catcher connects for a homerun in the 5-1 victory against the Pirates.

2004
The Rockies down the Padres, 8-2. Prior to the game, the Friars retire
former All-Star OF Tony Gwynn's jersey No. 19.

2006
With an 8-5 comeback victory over the Diamondbacks, the Marlins improve their
record to 69-68. After an 11-31 start, Florida becomes the first club in
big league history to have a winning record after being 20 games under .500.

The Phillies edge the Astros, 3-2, in 11 innings. Charlton Jimerson hits a
pinch HR in his 1st ML at-bat for Houston. Ryan Howard has a homer (#53)
for the Phils. No player in history had hit 76 homers in his first 1,000
at-bats; Howard reaches 77 in 853 at-bats. Aaron had 40 in his first 1,000
at-bats; Ruth had 38.

The Nationals' Ramon Ortiz allows no hits through 8 innings against the
Cardinals before Aaron Miles singles to lead off the 9th. Miles is erased
on a DP, but Albert Pujols homers to snap the shutout. Ortiz wins, 4-1.

on a 1 hitter. David Wright's 2nd-inning single is the only hit allowed by
James in his 8 innings of work.

Trailing 5-1, the Yankees explode for 10 runs in the 8th inning and go on
to defeat the Royals by a score of 12-5. Jorge Posada and Robinson Cano
each have a homer and a single in the big inning.

2010
Jim Thome hits a pair of homers to pass Mark McGwire for eighth place on
the all-time career list with 584. The Twins designated hitter's historic
round-trippers, which he blasts in the third and fourth innings off Colby
Lewis at Target Field, contributes to Minnesota's 12-4 victory over Texas.

2012
An unofficial rain delay occurs in Toronto when the retractable roof of
the Rogers Centre closes so slowly that the fans have to run for cover as

delays in the Rogers Centre, formerly known as the Skydome.

2013
In a 20-4 rout of the Tigers at Fenway Park, the Red Sox hit eight homeruns
matching a franchise record last accomplished 35 years ago. Boston homers in

Will Middlebrooks, David Ortiz (2), Jacoby Ellsbury and Stephen Drew all
going deep in the Fenway Park contest.

2017
J.D. Martinez of Arizona became the 18th player in Major League history to
