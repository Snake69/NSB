1902
In today's split with the Phillies, Tinker, Evers and Chance appear together
in the Chicago Cubs lineup for the first time, but not in the positions that
will earn them immortality. Johnny Evers, a New York State League rookie,
starts at SS, with Joe Tinker at 3B, Frank Chance at 1B, and veteran Bobby
Lowe at 2B. Philadelphia takes the opener, 11-3, behind White, while Chicago
is victorious in the nitecap, 6-1, behind Jack Taylor's pitching.

At the Polo Grounds, the last-place Giants follow a successful road trip
(7-4) by dropping two games to the Cards. St. Louis wins, 6-4, in game 1 as
5 of the first 6 batters in the 2nd inning lay down bunts. 3 runs score. The
Cards then pummel Mathewson for 12 hits in the nitecap to win, 8-2.

1905
At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson allows 3 hits, strikes out 9 and allows no
earned runs as New York whips the Phillies, 4-1.

Hillerich & Bradsby sign a contract with Honus Wagner to produce the first
autographed model bat.

1906
The AL's longest game to date takes place in Boston before 16,000. Rookies
Jack Coombs and 24-year-old Joe Harris go the route in a 24-inning struggle,
ending with a 4-1 Athletics victory after 4 hours 47 minutes. It sets the ML
record, later broken, and is still the AL mark for two pitchers. Two singles
and then Socks Seybold and Danny Murphy hit triples with two outs to end
the contest. Philadelphia's Jack Coombs faces 89 batters, striking out a
ML-record 18 (broken in 1962) and giving up 14 hits, while the Americans'
Harris fans 14 and yields 16 hits. Harris drops his record to 2-21, and will
start next year at 0-6 before exiting the majors for Providence, holding
the distinctions of the worst winning percentage (.091 for a 3-30 record)
and the fewest wins for any pitcher with 300 innings pitched. The 24 innings
pitched will only be exceeded this century by the 26-inning battle on May
1, 1920 between Oeschger and Cadore. There won't be a longer game in the
AL until May 9, 1984.

Like a rented mule. The Highlanders win their 6th game in 3 days from
Washington, sweeping their 3rd straight doubleheader, 5-4 and 5-3, for an AL
record. Three days later, they will move into first place, sweeping Boston,
7-0 and 1-0, for their 5th straight doubleheader sweep, a ML record.

With the regular umpires sick from food poisoning, Cub P Carl Lundgren and
Cardinal C Pete Noonan are picked to umpire at the West Side Grounds. The
Cubs, behind Mordecai Brown's 5-hitter, win 8-1 for their 14th win in a
row. The streak will end tomorrow, 5-2, with Lundgren again umpiring.

Tom Fisher, former NL pitcher, pitches a perfect game for Shreveport in a
win over Montgomery. He strikes out 14.

1907
Cubs P Ed Reulbach, who will be 17-4 with a 1.69 ERA, goes into the 9th
with a 2-0 lead over the Cardinals at Chicago. He gives up 8 straight hits,
7 runs and loses the game. The nitecap is stopped after 7 innings. Still
shell-shocked, the Cubs are shut out twice tomorrow by the last-place Cards,
losing 6-0 and 9-0.

1908
The month starts with the Giants in 1st in the NL with a 69-45 record,
followed by Chicago (70-47) and the Pirates (69-47). New York shakes off
its 3 losses to Chicago by beating up on Boston, winning two at South End
Grounds. Hooks Wiltse takes the opener, 4-1, and Mathewson coasts home in
the 2nd game, 8-0, allowing 3 hits. Dummy Taylor pitches the 9th against
the Doves.

1909
Bill O'Hara becomes the first pinch runner to steal two bases in the same
inning in the Giants' 9-6 victory over St. Louis at the Polo Grounds. The
Giants' outfielder, who will swipe 31 bases this season, will duplicate
the feat tomorrow off the same team.

1911
In game one of a Giants' doubleheader, Mathewson gives up 10 hits but beats
the Phils, 3-2. In game 2, Marquard one-hits the Phils, 2-0, walks none and
fans 10. The Phils' "Smoke" Stack and Marquard match zeros for 7 innings,
but a walk, single and two errors bring home two Giant runs. This is Rube's
second one-hitter in a row. His previous start, on August 24, resulted in
a two-hitter.

Whoops! Cleveland beats the White Sox, 2-1, with the help of a successful
hidden ball trick in the 9th inning. Chicago pinch runner Felix Chouinard
is caught by Cleveland SS Ivy Olson.

1913
In Pittsburgh, the Pirates arrive late by train from Chicago for a
morning/afternoon doubleheader against Cincinnati. For the morning game,
they wear their road grays, losing 5-4 in 10 innings. In their home whites
for the p.m. game, they win, 5-1.

Frederick W. Thayer, inventor of the catcher's mask, dies at 65.

1916
The Phils whitewash the Dodgers twice, winning 3-0 behind Grover Alexander and
6-0 to back Eppa Rixey. Alexander's win in the opener is his 14th shutout,
setting a major league record. The loser is Jack Coombs, who had set the
record of 13 shutouts while pitching for the A's in 1910. The Phils will
win tomorrow behind Al Demaree's 9th straight win, and twice more to move
into 1st place.

1917
The Cardinals, behind the pitching of Oscar Horstmann and Milt Watson, win
both ends of a doubleheader with Pittsburgh by 1-0 scores. Wilbur Cooper
takes the loss in game one on an unearned run in the 9th. Hal Carlson
loses the 2nd game. The Cards have now won three straight 1-0 games from
the Pirates, tying the ML mark and setting the NL mark.

In the bottom of the 1st inning at Cleveland, Tris Speaker tries to steal
home with Joe Evans batting (as noted by Retrosheet). Evans swings and
lines the ball into Speaker's face. Tiger manager Hugh Jennings allows a
courtesy fielder Elmer Smith to play CF in the 2nd frame while Speaker has
his face stitched. Speaker then returns to CF in the 3rd.

AL president Ban Johnson instructs umpires not to tolerate unnecessary
delays. His statement is an outgrowth of a complaint by Charles Comiskey
that protests of some managers and players about the condition of the ball
in recent games has made it necessary to play two hours or more. The New York
Times writes that, "Johnson said he would enforce the rule about discoloration
of the ball but he has given out no bulletin on the 'shine ball.'"

1918
Due to World War I, the major league regular season is originally scheduled to
end today, but the owners decide to play through Labor Day (September 2). The
Browns want the Indians fined and believe that Cleveland should forfeit
two games for refusing to play on the extended dates (September 1 & 2).

The Browns and Tigers finish the season with a doubleheader split in
St. Louis as the Cleveland Indians refuse to make the trip for the Labor
Day doubleheader. In game 2, Ty Cobb pitches 2 innings against the Browns
while the Browns' George Sisler pitches one scoreless inning. The Browns win,
6-2, and Sisler hits a double off of Cobb. Detroit wins the opener, 7-2.

1919
In the first of two Labor Day games, Babe Ruth allows 10 Washington hits,
but wins 2-1. Ruth drives home one run with a triple. The win is his last
in a Red Sox uniform. In the nitecap, Ruth's 7th-inning homer snaps a 1-1
tie as Boston wins, 4-1. It is the Babe's 24th homer.

At St. Louis, George Sisler gives the Browns a split for the day with an
11th-inning HR, for a 4-2 win. The Indians win the opener, 5-3.

1920
The Senators knock out rookie starter Duster Mails, but the Indians rally
to win, 9-5, and regain 1st place from the White Sox, loser of 6 of their
last 7 games.

Carl Mays shuts out the Browns, 3-0, on 4 hits for the Yankees.

The Reds beat the Braves, 6-3, behind Ray Fisher and Dolf Luque to move
into first place by two points.

1921
Maurice Archdeacon of Rochester (IL) establishes a new record for circling
the bases by completing the circuit in 13 2/5 seconds.

1924
In the second twinbill whitewash in the NL in 2 weeks, the Reds shut out
the Cardinals, 5-0 and 9-0. Carl Mays submarines the Birds in the opener
and Rube Benton coasts in the nitecap.

1925
In the first of 5 games in Washington, Johnson gives the Senators a 7-3 win
over the A's. Roger Peckinpaugh drives in 3 runs for the Senators. The Nats
now lead the A's, who are in a 12-game losing streak, by 4 1/2 games.

1926
Washington and Boston combine for a ML-record 11 sacrifices in a game won
by the Senators, 7-4. The Sox make 4 off the sacrifices, but it isn't enough.

1927
The Pirates take over 1st place by beating the visiting Cubs, 4-3. Joe
Harris has a double and a HR to back the Bucs' Lee Meadows. Both Waners
cut down runners with throws in the 2nd and 3rd innings.

1928
In Washington, Republican presidential candidate Herbert Hoover looks on as
"Approximately 99 percent of the spectators wore their straw hats, hoping
the Senators would give them a chance to get excited and hurl them away"
(NY Times). Alas, the Yankees win, 8-3. Waite Hoyt is the winner and
beneficiary of Bob Meusel's 4 for 4 hitting. Meusel has 3 RBIs. Garland
Braxton takes the loss.

Sheriff Blake is red hot for the Cubs, allowing just one hit, in besting
the Reds' Ray Kolp, 1-0. The lone Reds hit is a 5th-inning double by Long
George Kelly.

1930
The Cardinals take a pair from the Pirates and go into first place. Brooklyn,
New York and Chicago are all bunched at the top of the standings with
St. Louis. Cincy takes a pair from the Cubs, winning, 5-0, behind Red Lucas,
and, 2-1, behind Benny Frey.

In the 2nd of two games, Cleveland's Wes Ferrell tops the Browns, 9-5, for
his 13th straight win. The Indians take the opener as well, winning 13-8, as
pitcher Willis Hudlin helps with a grand slam off the Brownies' Dick Porter.

A Labor Day crowd of 72,000 packs Yankee Stadium to see the World Champion
A's split with the New Yorkers. The A's take the opener, 3-2, with reliever
Lefty Grove striking out Ruth with 2 on to end the game. Ruth drives in a
run in the nitecap, a 2-0 Yankee win. Red Ruffing pitches his 2nd two-hitter
in 2 weeks to beat George Earnshaw.

1931
Gehrig hits his 3rd grand slam in 5 days and his 6th HR in consecutive
games when he connects in a 5-1 2nd game win over the Red Sox. The blast,
his 40th of the year, comes in the 3rd inning off Ed Morris. Gehrig connects
in the opening 11-3 win against Milt Gaston, belting his 39th homer in the
7th inning. Lou finishes the day with 6 RBIs and has knocked in 21 runs in
the past 6 games. With the A's losing to Washington, New York is a half-game
out of 2nd place.

Giants rookie Jim Mooney notches his 4th win since being called up 3 weeks
ago, beating the Braves, 4-0. It is his 2nd shutout.

1933
In the first of two games with the Braves, Carl Hubbell pitches 10 innings
and drives in the winning run for a 2-0 win. He doesn't walk a batter and
never goes as deep as a 3-2 count on any hitter, holding the Braves to
4 hits. It is his 20th win and his 10th shutout of the year. Five of the
shutouts are 1-0, a NL record. Frankhouse is the hard-luck loser, when his
mates make 2 errors in the 10th. New York then takes the nitecap, 5-3.

1934
Jimmie Foxx cracks a two-run homer in the 9th, his 39th, off reliever Lefty
Grove, to give the A's an 8-7 win over the Red Sox. Foxx, filling it at 3B
for the injured Pinky Higgins, has three hits and 4 RBIs.

1935
In a rain-soaked game, the Senators take 14 innings to beat Lefty Grove
and the Red Sox, 2-1. The Nats will win 4 of 5 decisions this year off
Lefty. Grove will win his next 4 decisions to finish at 20-12, a big comeback
from his 8-8 record in 1934.

1936
Detroit's Schoolboy Rowe fires his second two-hit game in 8 days, beating
the A's, 4-1. Rowe beat the Red Sox on August 25 by a 5-0 score. Philadelphia
is saved from a shutout when Bob Johnson blasts his 22nd homerun in the 9th
inning. All of Detroit's runs come in a hitless 4th when they use 5 walks,
a fielder's choice and an error.

It is a wet afternoon in St. Louis for the Mound City celebration of the
60th anniversary of the NL. The 1876 recreated game starts at 2:30 with NL
publicity head Bill Brandt the tall-hatted umpire who is shot dead after
calling a runner out at home. Following is a 2 1/2 inning match between the
1926 Cards and the current team. Pete Alexander gives up an unearned run in
the 1st for the '26 team, and Vic Keen pitches the 2nd. George Earnshaw K's
4 of the 1926 team, but does give up a double to Watty Holm in the 1st. The
1936 Cards win, 1-0. The regular game between the Giants and Cards is washed
out after 4 innings.

1937
The Giants sign Bill Terry to a 5-year contract as manager and farm director
at $40,000 a year.

1939
The Dodgers and Cubs use an open date to play a doubleheader of two rained
out games. The visiting Cubs take the opener, 6-2, behind Larry French,
and the Dodgers take the nitecap, 3-1. In game 2, Gabby Hartnett sets a ML
record for games caught of 1,722. The old mark was held by Ray Schalk.

1941
Rudy York wallops 3 HRs and drives in 5 runs for the Tigers as the Tigers
beat the Browns, 9-5, in game 1 in Detroit. The Tigers rattle 20 hits in
the nitecap to win, 16-8.

In the first of two this Labor Day, Dolph Camilli hits the 200th HR of his
career against the Braves to put the game into extra innings. Camilli then
gives the Dodgers a 6-5 victory in the 15th inning with his 5th hit of the
game. Camilli's 29th HR of the year ties the game in the 8th, his double in
the 10th with 2 on keeps the Dodgers alive, and a 2-out single in the 15th
wins the game. Game 2 is cut short at 2-2 with Al Javery on the mound for
Boston; he'll get no rest tomorrow as he is the loser in a 9-2 Brooklyn win.

At Fenway, the Red Sox sweep 2 from the Senators, 13-9 and 10-3. Williams
has only 5 official at-bats, but has 3 hits - all homers - to take over
the AL lead from Charlie Keller. Ted walks 4 times.

1942
The 2nd place Cardinals match Brooklyn by recalling OF Irv Dusak. Cards
owner Sam Breadon responds, "They can have their Newsom, but I'd rather
have Dusak. He has been one of the most sought-after players in the minor
leagues." Dusak, however, hits just .185.

After going 24-9 in July and 25-8 in August, the Cardinals are still 3 1/2
games behind Brooklyn. Brooklyn beats Pittsburgh today, 4-2.

A story in the Chicago Tribune reports that player-manager Parnell Woods
of the Negro AL Cleveland Buckeyes, and two teammates have been invited to
try out with the Indians at the start of the 1943 season. The two teammates
are Eugene Bremmer and Sam Jethroe, who is leading the league in hitting
with a .450 average.

1944
The Giants lose to Brooklyn, 8-1, as Giant Joe Medwick is hit on the
elbow and leaves the game for treatment. With both teams out of the race,
Dodgers manager Leo Durocher agrees to allow Medwick to reenter the game if
Durocher can pick the courtesy pinch runner for him. He selects slow-footed
Gus Mancuso, who is promptly erased on a DP ground ball.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. The Senators start semi-pro
pitcher Jug Thesenga, who holds the Yankees scoreless for 5 innings before
the roof caves in. But the Senators rally to win, 10-7, behind reliever
Roger Wolff, who snaps his personal 11-game losing streak.

1945
The Phils beat the Braves, 8-3, in Boston, as Vince DiMaggio hits his 4th
grand slam of the year, tying a major league mark. An injury will shortly
end the season for the senior DiMaggio.

Detroit's Hal Newhouser wrenches his back pitching against the Indian's
Bob Feller. Newhouser leaves the game in the 7th and will stay behind when
the team leaves for New York, but will rejoin them on the 7th. The Tigers
win, 5-4, behind Jim Tobin and are just 1 1/2 games ahead of the 2nd place
Senators.

1947
Jack Lohrke hits a homer against the Braves, number 183 for the season for
the Giants, breaking the 1936 ML record held by the Yankees. Mel Ott's club
had hit 5 HRs in a doubleheader against the Cubs August 24 to break Chicago's
1929 NL record. The Giants will finish with 221 HRs, led by Johnny Mize,
Walker Cooper, Willard Marshall and rookie Bobby Thomson.

In the nitecap 7-4 loss, A's 1B Ferris Fain participates in 6 DPs to
tie the ML record. Washington takes the opener as well, 4-0, on Mickey
Haefner's 7-hitter.

1948
The host Braves split a pair with the Reds, as Johnny Vander Meer bests Warren
Spahn, 3-1, in the opener. Glenn Elliott, just up from the AAA Brewers,
is awarded the victory in the 11-1 nitecap, even though he pitches just
3 innings. Elliott collides with Ted Kluszewski while running to 1B and
is injured after pitching his only innings of 1948. Reliever Clyde Shoun
throws the last 6 innings.

1949
Washington's Dick Weik should change his name to Walk as he hands out 13
base on balls in nine innings, losing to the White Sox, 3-0. He matches
Tommy Byrne's largest walk-game earlier in the year and he'll close out
his career in 1954 with more walks than innings pitched. Randy Gumpert is
the winner today as both pitchers allow 4 hits apiece.

1951
OF Don Mueller hits 3 HRs in an 8-1 Giants' win over the Dodgers. His first
homer comes against Ralph Branca, coming off two consecutive shutouts, and
Mueller hits his 3rd HR, a two-run shot off Phil Haugstad. Sal Maglie is
the winner, giving up 7 singles and hits Robinson on the wrist in the 3rd
to force home the only Dodger run. Whitey Lockman gets plunked twice for
New York. Al Dark and Eddie Stanky combine in the 5th on a triple play off
a liner by Reese. The Dodgers' lead over the Giants is now down to 6 games.

1952
In the 2nd game of a doubleheader in St. Louis, the Indians lose a critical
game, 2-1, in 5 innings when rain halts the game for the 2nd and last
time. The Indians are ahead in the 6th, but a porous tarp turns the infield
into a quagmire, washing out their three runs. The Indians protest the game,
saying Bill Veeck told the grounds crew to work slowly, but Will Harridge
will reject the protest.

1953
The Cards hit 5 HRs, all of them solo shots, but lose to the Dodgers'
Preacher Roe, 12-5, at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers collect 17 hits in the
win. The 5 solo HRs - one each by Musial, Harry Elliot, and Rip Repulski,
and 2 by Steve Bilko - tie a NL record.

Chicago's Virgil Trucks surrenders a homer to Mantle in the 7th that proves
to be the game-winner, as the White Sox lose to the Yankees, 3-2.

1954
At Crosley Field, Redlegs Ted Kluszewski hits 2 HRs to break his own club
mark of 40 HRs. He will wind up with 49 for the season. Despite the Klu
clouts, Cincinnati loses to Philadelphia, 9-3. In a pre-game stunt, Reds
catcher Hobie Landrith catches a ball dropped out of a helicopter hovering
some 500-600 feet over the field.

1956
Sparked by Warren Spahn's 2-hit pitching and the clutch hitting of Adcock,
the Braves beat the Cards, 3-1. Adcock has 3 RBIs. Despite the win, the
Braves lead is cut to 2 games as the Dodgers sweep a pair from the Giants.

1957
The Yankees purchase Sal "the Barber" Maglie from the Dodgers, but he
is ineligible for WS play. Maglie is the last to play for all three New
York teams.

1958
The Cardinals' Vinegar Bend Mizell beats the Reds, 1-0, while walking a
NL record (for a shutout) 9 batters. The Reds also swipe 5 bases. Mizell,
a southpaw from Vinegar Bend, Alabama, allows 4 hits, the same number as
his opponent Joe Nuxhall, who loses on an unearned run. The Reds come back
to win the 2nd game of the doubleheader, 9-3. Alex Kellner is the winner
with 8 1/3 innings of shutout relief.

In San Francisco, the Giants sweep a doubleheader from the Dodgers (and 5 of
6 in the Labor Day series) by taking the 1st in an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader,
8-6. Mays is 5 for 5 with 2 doubles and a HR to drive in 5 runs. The
nitecap is a memorable 4 hour 35 minute marathon. The Giants tie in the
9th on Schmidt's homer, and the Dodgers go ahead, 5-4, in the 16th on
Furillo's RBI. Whitey Lockman's HR in the bottom of the 16th ties it,
then a bunt single by Ray Jablonski is followed by another bunt by P Ruben
Gomez. Errors by Roseboro and Furillo follow allowing Jabo to score the
winning run, 6-5. Mays is 11 for 20 for the series, with 4 homers. San
Francisco Police Chief Frank Ahern, sitting behind home plate, dies of a
heart attack at the climax of the 2nd game.

Bob Buhl, sidelined by shoulder ailments, makes his first appearance since
May 13, beating the Cubs, 2-1, for the first-plave Braves. He beats Bob

9-3. Glenn Hobbie picks up his 3rd win of the year against the Braves and
his 10th overall.

1961
30-year-old rookie Cuno Barragan hits his only big league homerun in his
first major league at-bat when he takes Dick LeMay deep over the left-field
fence at Wrigley Field in the second inning of the Cubs' 4-3 loss to San
Francisco. The 29-year-old catcher will play in 69 games for Chicago over
three seasons.

The AL's biggest crowd of the year, 65,566, sees Whitey Ford and Don Mossi
duel at Yankee Stadium as a weekend battle for first place begins. Two-out
9th-inning hits by Elston Howard, Yogi Berra and Bill Skowron give New York
a 1-0 win over the Tigers.

Francisco.

1963
Yankees CF Tom Tresh joins teammate Mickey Mantle among 4 AL and 5 NL players

in the 8th, jumping on the first pitch from Mike McCormick.

At Pittsburgh, Bill Virdon hits a 2-out game-ending grand slam to give the
Bucs a 6-4 win over the Reds.

Cleveland takes a pair from the Tigers, winning 6-3 and 3-1. Mike De la
Hoz hits a first-inning grand slam in game 1 for the margin.

P Curt Simmons of the Cardinals drives in a run with a triple in the second
and then steals home on an aborted squeeze play. He also knocks in another
run and beats the Phils, 7-3. Simmons, who in his 20-year career will steal
just 2 bases, is on 3rd base when a squeeze play goes awry, and beats a
wide throw to home from P Chris Short. It is the last steal of home by a
pitcher until 1983, and just the 4th in the NL in the last 40 years. Harry
Dorish in 1950 stole home, the last time an AL pitcher pulled off the theft.

1964
Masanori Murakami becomes the first Japanese-born player to appear in the

Wes Covington and Frank Thomas supply the power outages.

The Cardinals move past the faltering Giants into 3rd place with a 5-4 win
over the Braves. Former Brave, now Cardinals utility C Bob Uecker hits his
first HR of the year, then singles in the winning run in the 9th to win it

Chicago.

1965

season helping the Redbirds beat the Braves at Busch Stadium, 7-4. The
Memphis native becomes the first catcher to lead a league in three-baggers.

1967
Cincinnati's Bob Lee walks Dick Groat with the bases loaded in the 21st inning
to give the Giants a 1-0 victory at Crosley Field. Twenty scoreless innings
tie the ML mark set by the Pirates and the Braves on August 1, 1918, a game
Pittsburgh also won in the 21st, 2-0. Gaylord Perry, with 9 one-run losses
during the season, pitches the first 16 innings of shutout ball, with Frank
Linzy going the last 5. Mel Queen tosses 9 1/3 innings for the Reds. Perry
is in the midst of a franchise record 40 consecutive-scoreless-innings streak.

8-2, behind Fergie Jenkins' 17th win. Former Cub Don Cardwell wins the
nitecap, 3-0, striking out 11.

year. Both no-nos are 1-0 games against Seattle.

consecutive games with his second-inning single in LA's 10-6 victory over
New York. The mark was established by Zack Wheat in 1916.

The Giants move past the Reds into first place with a 12-2 win over Montreal.

Willie Davis, who cracks a single and a double, ties the club record of
hitting in 29 straight games. The mark was set by Zack Wheat in 1916, and
Davis will double tomorrow to break it. Andy Kosko adds 4 straight hits as
the Dodgers beat the visiting Mets, 10-6. Koosman is kayoed after 1/3 of
an inning and takes the loss against Jim Bunning.

1970
The Red Sox take an 8-1 lead at Fenway, but Detroit rallies to win,
10-9. The Sox take the lead on a Mike Andrews homer and a grand slam by

4 homers, including a grand slam by Jim Price, to win. Patterson is the
winner over Siebert.

1971
At Parc Jarry in Montreal, the Pirates start what is believed to be the
first all-black lineup (including several Latinos) in ML history, in a 10-7
win over the Phillies. The lineup:  Rennie Stennett, 2B; Gene Clines, CF;
Roberto Clemente, RF; Willie Stargell, LF; Manny Sanguillen, C; Dave Cash,

The Major League Scouting Bureau is instituted as a way to cut costs by
centralizing scouting. Membership is not mandatory until 1984, and only 17
of 24 teams initially agree to the $118,000 fee for joining. All AL clubs
except the White Sox and Toronto join. In the NL, the Cubs, Montreal, Pirates,
Braves, Houston and the Reds join. Brewers GM Jim Wilson is put in charge.

When he whiffs Pirate Manny Sanguillen in the seventh inning of the Mets'
3-0 victory, Tom Seaver becomes the first pitcher to strike out at least 200

1980
Tigers OF Al Cowens and White Sox reliever Ed Farmer publicly end their
long-running feud by shaking hands at home plate prior to Chicago's 11-3
win at Tiger Stadium. The feud began in 1979 when Farmer broke Cowens' jaw
with a pitch, and flared again this June 20th when Cowens hit a ground ball
off Farmer and attacked the pitcher instead of running to 1B. Cowens was
suspended for 7 games and a warrant was issued for his arrest in Illinois,
forcing him to skip last week's Tigers-White Sox series in Chicago. Farmer
agreed to drop the charges in exchange for a handshake, and the 2 players
brought out the lineup cards before today's game.

1984
Two weeks after being given a vote of confidence by club owner George Argyros,
Mariners manager Del Crandall is fired and replaced by 3B coach Chuck Cottier.

but the Rangers fall to the Red Sox, 6-4.

1987
Williamsport (Eastern League) Bills catcher Dave Bresnahan introduces a new
wrinkle to baseball - the hidden potato. With a Reading runner, Rick Rudblad,
on 3B, Bresnahan returns from a time out with a shaved potato hidden in his
mitt. On the next pitch he throws the potato wildly on a pickoff attempt. When
the runner trots home, Bresnahan tags him out with the real ball. The umpire,
unamused, rules the runner safe, gives the catcher an error, and fines him
$50. Bresnahan replied, "I thought it'd be a do-over."

The Red Sox trade 2 heroes from their 1986 AL Championship team, sending

to be named later.

In a 3-2 loss to the Cubs, Houston's Billy Hatcher becomes the first
player this season to be ejected for using an illegal corked bat, and will
eventually be suspended for 10 games by NL president Bart Giamatti. Hatcher
claims he borrowed the bat from P Dave Smith and only used it in batting
practice. Baseball has seen a rash of protests regarding allegedly doctored
bats this season, partly in response to the record number of homeruns
being hit.

1989
Eight days after banning Pete Rose from baseball for life, Commissioner
Bart Giamatti dies suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 51.

1990
The 3rd inside-the-park grand slam of the season is hit by Boston's
Mike Greenwell off Greg Cadaret, as the Red Sox beat visiting New York,
15-1. Greenwell's grounder eludes Jesse Barfield in the RF corner ...
Barfield's shoetop miss on August 14 gave Polonia his slam. The last season
with 3 inside-the-park slams? 1947. Greenwell's only other inside-the-park
slam was also off Cadaret, in 1989 at Fenway. Boston jumps on Yankee starter
Andy Hawkins who lasted 1/3 of an inning. Hawkins has now pitched a total of
one inning in 3 starts at Fenway Park and has given up 18 runs (ERA 162.00).

Bobby Witt allows 10 walks against Oakland in 7 innings, the 2nd Ranger
in a 4 days to hand out 10 walks. Before this season, the last pitcher to

and wins, 3-2, for his 10th victory in a row.

1992

on David Wells.

1997

plate. The debut prompts walkup sales of 15,000.

Before 50,869 at the Vet, the Phillies defeat the Yankees, 5-1, behind Chuck
Schilling, who fans 16 batters in 8 innings of action, and does not walk
a man. The Phils will win the next to sweep the series with the defending
World champs.

1998
In a 7-1 victory over the Marlins, Cardinal slugger Mark McGwire homers
twice breaking Hack Wilson's National League single season homerun record
of 56. Mac's seventh inning shot ties the 1930 mark and a new record is
established in the ninth when he hits a Don Pall pitch 472 feet over the
Pro Player Stadium wall in centerfield. McGwire also eclipses Babe Ruth's
record of 114 HRs in consecutive seasons set in 1927-28.

1999
Due to the union's failure to force an early start to negotiations for a
new labor contract with mass resignations, twenty-two of baseball's regular

Joyner, a U.S. District Judge, the union agrees the 22 will no longer
provide services for major league baseball.

Atlanta. Their victory 2 days ago ended the Braves' 10-game win streak.

2000
Darin Erstad breaks the Angels' club record for total hits in a season
(202) set in 1970 by Alex Johnson by getting three hits in a 9-8 loss to
the White Sox giving him 204 so far this season.

The Baltimore Orioles turn the season's fifth triple play and the first
triple-killing in Jacobs Field history in the second inning against
the Cleveland Indians. On a pop up to short the infield fly rule is not
called. With runners at first and second and no outs, O's SS Melvin Mora
lets Sandy Alomar's pop fly drop, apparently intentionally, and throws to
2B Jerry Hairston who tags the runner at second as well as the runner coming
from first. Alomar, believing the infield fly rule had been called, retreated
to the dugout and was called out for leaving the basepath resulting in a
6-4-3 triple play. Charlie Manual doesn't agree and gets tossed. Cleveland
overcomes the TP to win, 5-2, behind Chuck Finley.

The Reds ink Hawaiian Dane Sardinha, a 2nd round draft pick in June, and high
school SS David Espinosa, a 23rd round pick. Both players are represented
by agent Scott Boras and held out all summer for long-term ML contracts.

Philadelphia A's with 17 consecutive victories in 1931.

Boston trims the Indians, 7-1, behind the strong pitching of Tim Wakefield,
who doesn't allow a hit before Matt Lawton's HR in the 5th. Manny Ramirez
and Brian Daubach hit back-to-back HRs, and Johnny Damon scores 3 runs. Jim
Thome reaches 100 walks for the 4th consecutive year and the 6th time in his
career. Thome is the only player in Indians history to ever have consecutive
100-walk seasons.

Arizona tips the Giants, 7-6, as Tony Womack smacks 2 homers and lays down
a 9th-inning bunt single to load the bases. David Pellucci follows with a
2-run double to win it. Jeff Kent has 2 RBIs to reach the 100-RBI mark for
the 6th straight time, a record for secondbasemen. D'Back pitchers continue
to respect Barry Bonds, walking him 4 times today. They walked him twice
yesterday and 4 times on the 30th, giving him 10 walks in three straight
regulation-length games. Barry will have tomorrow off and get a walk on
the 3rd.

2004
The Marlins edge the Mets, 5-4. Armando Benitez gets the save in relief. It is
his 10th save of the year against NY for a new ML record for saves against
a club in a year. He will add one more save to give him 11 against his
former teammates.

Minnesota's Terry Mulholland goes 6 innings and allows 2 runs in the Twins'
4-2 win over Baltimore. Mulholland and catcher Pat Borders, who was obtained
yesterday from Seattle for B.J. Garbe, are the first pair of 40-something
batterymates since Curt Davis and Clyde Sukeforth for the Dodgers in 1945.

2005
The Pacific Coast League announces the total season attendance for the
circuit surpasses 7-million fans. The PCL had set a new single season
record in minor league history when the 16-team circuit passed the 6.8
million mark earlier in the month.

The first bus loads of Hurricane Katrina refugees, formerly housed at the
SuperDome in New Orleans, begin to arrive early this morning at Houston's
Astrodome. The former home of the Astros will afford the displaced an
opportunity to escape the unhealthy horrendous conditions of their former
shelter by supplying air conditioning, cots, food and showers for eventually
25,000 people who are expected from Louisiana.

2007
In only his second major league start, Clay Buchholz, using an assortment
of fastballs, curves and changeups, no-hits the Orioles in front of a very
supportive Fenway crowd, 10-0. The 23-year-old rookie, who was called up
from Triple-A Pawtucket to make the start, becomes the youngest of the 17
players who have accomplished the feat in Red Sox history.

2008
Cliff Lee shuts out the White Sox, 5-0, to become the Indians' 56th
twenty-game winner in franchise history, but the first to accomplish the
feat in 34 years. The last Tribe moundsman to win as many games was Gaylord

In Arizona's 8-6 comeback victory over the Cardinals, Stephen Drew singles
in the first, triples in the third, homers in the fifth and doubles in the
seventh to complete the cycle. The Diamondbacks' shortstop becomes the third
player in franchise history, and the first major leaguer to accomplish the
feat at Chase Field, which was formerly known as the Bank One Ballpark.

Adrian Beltre triples in the eighth inning off Rangers right-hander Josh Rupe
to become the fourth player in franchise history to hit for the cycle. The
rare event is accomplished twice today as Diamondbacks shortstop Stephen
Drew also collects a single, double, triple and home run in a game against
the Cardinals at Chase Field.

In his complete-game effort against the Pirates, C.C. Sabathia gives up
only a questionable infield hit to Andy LaRoche in the fifth inning of the
Brewers' 7-0 victory at PNC Park. The club plans to forward a DVD of the
play to Major League Baseball hoping somehow official scorer Bob Webb, the
only person allowed to reverse his own call according to the rule book, can
be convinced to change the scoring of the grounder to the mound to an error.

2009
In his first game back from the DL after suffering a torn right testicle
when a bad hop grounder hit him in the groin last month, Adrian Beltre hears
The Nutcracker Suite when he steps into the batter's box. Mariner teammate
Ken Griffey Jr arranged to have the Safeco Field PA system play the waltz
to have some fun with the third baseman, who decided not wear a protective
cup until today's game.

2010
The Nationals announce Rob Dibble will no longer be employed as a TV analyst
for the team's games on MASN, the network that telecasts the Washington
games. The former major league reliever, as a host on a Sirius XM Radio
show, loses his job after severely chastising Stephen Strasburg for not
pitching through pain before the rookie phenom was diagnosed with a torn
elbow ligament.

2014
The Phillies become the eleventh team in baseball history to throw a combined
no-hitter when four of their hurlers do not yield a hit in the team's 7-0
victory over the Braves. Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels goes the first six
innings in the Turner Field contest with relievers Jake Diekman, Ken Giles and
Jonathan Papelbon each tossing a perfect inning to accomplish the rare feat.
