1901
Giants and Pirates outfielder, Tom O'Brien, 28, dies in Phoenix. A
popular player with the Giants, O'Brien played for the Pirates in 1900,
then accompanied the Giants and Dodgers last fall on a trip to Cuba for a
series of exhibition games. On the boat trip over, he was told that if he
drank enough sea water he'd be sick, but would then be cured of any sea
sickness. Both O'Brien and Kid Gleason became violently ill following the
prescription, but O'Brien was so affected that all his internal organs were
damaged, and he never recovered.

for 10 days. The AL allows each club to name just 2 pitchers who will be
allowed to use the pitch for one more season. The NL allows each club to name
all its spitball pitchers. No pitchers other than those designated will be
permitted to use it, and none at all after 1920 (though this will be changed
in December). The list of grandfathered spitballers will include Red Faber
(White Sox), Doc Ayers and Dutch Leonard (Tigers), Ray Caldwell and Stan
Coveleski (Indians), Bill Doak (Cardinals), Phil Douglas (Giants), Dana
Fillingim (Braves), Ray Fisher (Reds), Marv Goodwin (Cardinals), Burleigh
Grimes and Clarence Mitchell (Dodgers), Jack Quinn (Yankees), Dick Rudolph

Other rule changes:  the adoption of writer Fred Lieb's proposal that a
game-winning HR with men on base be counted as a HR even if its run is not
needed to win the game. Also, the intentional walk is banned, and everything
that happens in a protested game will go in the records. From 1910 to 1919,
records in protested games were excluded.

and two minor leaguers - to the Mariners and agree to a contract extension
to obtain Seattle's superstar Ken Griffey Jr. Junior's nine-year $116.5

current market is considered quite a bargain.

2001

unpopular with the Wrigley Field fans.

2006
Deliberating for a little more than four hours, a jury rules the Angels did
not breach a contract with the city of Anaheim when the ball club changed its
