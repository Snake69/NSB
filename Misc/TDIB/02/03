1914
A joint NL-AL rules committee decrees that:  a runner touched or held by
a coach while rounding 3B is out; coaches may now assist other members of
their team, not just base runners; the frequently violated rule requiring
pitchers to stand behind the rubber until ready to pitch is rescinded -
they may now stand on the rubber; base runners are now not permitted to

1915
The AL bans the emery ball, a pitch introduced by Russ Ford in 1910.

1928

SS Jimmy Cooney gets to spend his last ML season with his brother Johnny
when the Cards sell him to the Boston Braves.

1934
The St. Louis Cardinals and Browns discontinue broadcasts from Sportsman's
Park. Games had been aired since 1926 but on weekdays for only the last
2 years. The cutback is a response to declining attendance, and the radio
broadcasts are thought to keep fans at home.

Powel Crosley, local millionaire, heads a syndicate that buys just
over half the stock in the Cincinnati Reds from Sidney Weil. No price is
announced. Crosley, owner of a 500,000 watt radio station, is on the board of
the Central Trust Bank, and it is the bank that had loaned money to Sidney
Weil and his syndicate to buy the Reds. Weil was in the process of raising
money to pay off the bank when Crosley's purchase takes place. The Reds'
home park will be renamed Crosley Field.

1938
College basketball player Lou Boudreau is suspended by the University of
Illinois for taking illegal payments from the Indians, but the 19-year-old

The special Veterans Committee selects second baseman Billy Herman (Cubs,
Dodgers, Braves and Pirates), skipper Bucky Harris (Senators, Tigers, Red
Sox, Phillies and Yankees) and outfielder Earl Averill (Indians, Tigers,
and Braves) to the Hall of Fame. An outspoken Averill had informed his
family to decline the honor if he was ever to be inducted posthumously,
fortunately he was enshrined in Cooperstown eight years before his passing.

1977
The Hall of Fame's Special Committee on the Negro Leagues picks Martin Dihigo,

1979
Expecting to lose Rod Carew to free agency, the Twins trade the 7-time
batting champion to the Angels for OF Ken Landreaux, 3B Dave Engle, and
pitchers Paul Hartzell and Brad Havens. In Carew's first season with the

American League All-Star teams.

The Yankees buy two players from the A's, P Greg Cochrane for $100,000 and

club (Carolina League) last season, is suspended from organized baseball

SO/9 innings pitched in 1998 (minimum:  50 IP). Meanwhile, Kerry Wood set
the major league record with 12.58 SO/9 IP for pitchers who qualified for
the ERA title.

The Mets decline to offer a new contract to announcer Tim McCarver, a 16

best paid receiver in baseball history.

2004
The Marlins sign free agent IF Wil Cordero to a contract.

(Marlins, 1997) and Orlando Hernandez (1998, Yankees), Irish (Giants, 1922)
and Bob Meusel (Yankees, 1923), and Bubba (Colts, 1970) and Tody Smith
(Cowboys, 1971).

2009
Oliver Perez agrees to a $36 million, three-year deal to stay with the
Mets. The 29-year-old inconsistent southpaw who has posted a 26-20 record
with New York since being obtained from Pittsburgh during the 2006 season,
will be part of the team's starting rotation.

Garrett Atkins (.286, 21, 99) avoids arbitration agreeing to a one-year deal
with the Rockies. The 29-year-old third baseman's $7.05 million contract makes
him the second-highest paid player on the team, trailing only Todd Helton.

Justin Verlander (11-17, 4.84) agrees to a one-year contract worth $3,675,000
to stay with the Tigers, a dramatic increase from last season. The 2006
AL Rookie of the Year's original five-year contract, which slated the
right-hander for a $600,000 salary in 2009, could be terminated if he had
enough service time to become eligible for arbitration.

Rickie Weeks (.234, 14, 89) avoids arbitration with the Brewers agreeing

been injury prone over his first five seasons with the Brew Crew, can earn
more with performance bonuses based on plate appearances.

2010
Casey Kotchman and the Mariners, who recently acquired the first baseman in
a trade with Boston for Bill Hall, come to terms on a one-year deal worth

in his last 1,584 chances, covering a span of 185 games.

2011
In a SRO news conference at Yankee Stadium, Andy Pettitte becomes the
first 'Core of Four' teammate, a group which includes shortstop Derek
Jeter, catcher Jorge Posada and closer Mariano Rivera, to announce his
retirement. The 38-year-old southpaw, who compiled a 240-138 record during
his sixteen years in the major leagues, tells the reporters, "my body would
get to where it needs to be, but my heart's not where it needs to be."

In a lawsuit unsealed at a Manhattan federal bankruptcy court, Mets' owners
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz are named in a complaint brought by the trustee
for the victims of Bernie Madoff that contends they used the profits from
investing in the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme to financially support their
businesses, including their ownership of the major league club, in the face
of repeated warnings that the investments might be fraudulent. The possible
$1 billion settlement has created speculation in the sports and banking
industries that the team will be sold to meet the financial obligation.

2012
The Cubs and Matt Garza avoid arbitration when they agree to a one-year $9.5
million deal. The 28-year-old right-hander posted a 10-10 record along with
