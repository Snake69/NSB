Giants president Hempstead objects to the International League's efforts
to put a team in the Bronx.

Today's issue of The Sporting News reports on Joe Jackson's speaking tour
(as noted by Bill Deane):  "One thing Joe tells them is how he turned down
$60,000 to play with the Feds for three years. 'It looked like a lot of
money,' he said, 'but there are things in this world to be regarded above
money - keeping faith with your friends, for instance.' All of which goes
to show that you don't have to know how to read and write to be a man of
principle and conscience."

with 22 homers in 1923, will finish 2nd in the NL, but his 20 steals in
43 attempts, the century's worst percentage for anyone with 20 steals,
will barely qualify him for the 20-20 club.
