battle, but the league will have no effective leadership until 1903.

1920
The Cubs give an unconditional release to Lee Magee after they learned a
week ago from him that he had been betting against his team. Magee will sue
the Cubs for his salary of $4,500 charging that his livelihood as a ball
player was destroyed through the sudden canceling of his contract. The Cubs
will ask for a dismissal of the suit, saying that "previous to the making
of the contract the plaintiff was guilty of betting against the team of
which he was a member, and sought to win bets by intentional bad playing
to defeat said team."

1923
Christy Mathewson becomes president of the Boston Braves after buying the

McDonough. The deal does not include Braves Field, which still belongs to
James Gaffney. There are also 85 minority stockholders.

1929
The Red Sox announce they will play Sunday games, allowed for the first
time in Boston, at Braves Field, because Fenway Park is located too close
to a church.

1936
The Giants buy back good-hitting 1B Sam Leslie from the Dodgers.

1943
Phil Wrigley and Branch Rickey charter the All-American Girls Softball
League. The league will operate around the Chicago area and is formed as
a sports backup in case the government shuts down ML baseball. The league

of 40 feet and bases 68 feet apart, eventually evolving to distances close
to the major league lengths.

1953

convinces the Board of Directors of Anheuser-Busch to purchase the Cardinals
from Fred Saigh for $3.75 million dollars.

The U.S. Court of Appeals rules that organized baseball is a sport and not a
business, affirming the 25-year-old Supreme Court ruling. This effectively
dismisses the antitrust suits of Jack Corbett and former Dodger farm hand
Walter Kowalski. The $300,000 suit of Corbett, the owner of the Texas League
El Paso club, is based on his belief that he lost money when ML baseball
prohibited him from signing several players suspended for participation
in the Mexican League. Kowalski's $150,000 suit is based on the general
principles of the antitrust and restraint-of-trade laws. Their lawyer in
these cases is Frederic Johnson, who also represents Danny Gardella in his
suit against ML baseball.

manager of the A's for $125,000 4 months after being fired by the Yankees
for the 2nd time. During his three-year tenure in the dugout, the fiery
skipper will compile a 215-218 record and will win a division title as the
first half leader in the AL West of the 1981 strike-shortened season.

2009
Tom Glavine, with the most wins among active pitchers, agrees to a one-year,
$1 million deal to stay with the Braves. The 42-year-old southpaw, who
underwent surgery for a torn ligament in his left elbow, posted a 2-4 record
with a 5.54 ERA in 13 starts for Atlanta before being shut down for the
season last August.

Baltimore inks Brian Roberts to a four-year contract extension reported
to be worth $40 million. Along with Nick Markakis, who recently signed a
six-year $66 million deal, the 31-year-old talented second basemen becomes
the second home-grown Oriole player within a month to agree to a long term
deal to stay with the last-place club.

Avoiding arbitration, the Nationals and Ryan Zimmerman (.283, 14, 51)
agree to a one-year $3.3 million contract. The 24-year-old third baseman is
Washington's all-time leader in almost every offensive category, including
homers, RBIs, runs, and hits, as well as contests played, since the franchise
relocated from Montreal four seasons ago.
