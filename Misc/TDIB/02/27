except after 2 strikes. To cut the cost of balls fouled and unrecovered,
the committee urges that "batsmen who foul off good strikes are to be
disciplined." The AL will not adopt this rule for several years. Other new
rules:  catchers must play within 10 feet of the batter; a ball will be
called if the pitcher does not throw to a ready and waiting batter within
20 seconds; players using indecent or improper language will be banished
by the umpire. One rule stating that a ball will be called when a batter is
hit by a pitch but, in a mail vote, the owners will rescind this in April,
