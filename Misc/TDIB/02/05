1903
The Cubs and White Stockings, the first to play an interleague series,
announce a 15-game preseason City Series.

1919
Charges brought in 1918 by Reds owner Garry Herrmann and manager Mathewson
against Hal Chase for betting against his team and throwing games in collusion
with gamblers are dismissed by NL president John Heydler. Heydler decides
Chase's sometimes indifferent play was due to "carelessness." Two weeks later
John McGraw trades 1B Walter Holke and C Bill Rariden to the Reds for Chase,
but the Giants will also have their problems with him. In September, McGraw
will send Chase and Heinie Zimmerman home without explanation; during the
investigation of the Black Sox scandal in 1920, McGraw will testify that
the dismissal was because both players had thrown games and tried to enlist
Fred Toney and Benny Kauff in their scheme.

1921
The Yankees purchase a 20-acre plot of land in the Bronx for the future
site of Yankee Stadium.

1930
Leo Durocher (.246, 0, 32) is selected off waivers by the Reds. The
24-year-old shortstop, an unpopular presence in the Yankees clubhouse,
falls out of favor in New York after a salary dispute with Ed Barrow,
the club's general manager.

The Reds trade 39-year-old pitcher Dolf Luque to the Dodgers for Doug
McWeeny. McWeeny will play 8 games for the Reds, while the Cuban Cutie will
pitch another 6 seasons.

1931
Hack Wilson, who set National League marks for homeruns and RBIs the previous
season, signs for $35,000. The 31-year-old Cubs outfielder's RBI record is
still standing today.

A court finds Lefty Grove not liable in a shooting accident that occurred
in November 1928. Grove was hunting with a friend, Roberdeau Annan, in
West Virginia and when Annan crested a hill, Grove shot him by mistake,
blinding his left eye.

1932
Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pirates, dies at the age of 66 from
complications following prostate surgery. Barney's tenure as owner is the
longest in the history of the major leagues, though this will eventually
be topped. A few months before his death, he was succeeded as president of
the club by his son-in-law, Bill Benswanger.

1934
Future all-time homerun leader Hammerin' Hank Aaron is born in Mobile,
Alabama. The slugger will hit 755 homeruns playing for the Braves and Brewers.

1935
Homerun king Babe Ruth is released by the New York Yankees.

1942
In one of their best trades ever, the Braves get minor-leaguer Tommy Holmes
from the Yankees for Buddy Hassett and Gene Moore. Hassett will hit .284, then
join the Navy and will not make it back to the ML. The much-traveled Moore
will be traded by the Yanks in less than 3 weeks. Holmes, with three .300+
seasons in the IL, could not break into New York's all star outfield. In
10 seasons with the Braves he will hit over .300, win the MVP in 1948,
and will establish the National League record for consecutive game hitting
streak with 37 until it is broken by Pete Rose in 1978.

1946
The Phils purchase P Al Jurisich and OF Johnny Wyrostek from the Cardinals.

The Cardinals sell OF/1B Johnny Hopp to the Braves for a reported $40,000
and the transfer of infielder Eddie Joost to the Cardinals' Rochester farm
team. Hopp will play well in Boston, while the veteran Joost will break in
as a regular with the A's in 1947.

1951
California governor Earl Warren denies the rumor he is a candidate for
baseball commissioner.

1954
In a swap of vets, the Orioles trade OF Johnny Groth and SS Johnny Lipon
to the White Sox for OF Sam Mele and SS Neil Berry. Lipon will go to the
Reds on April 18th for Grady Hatton and then retire after one NL at-bat.

1956
New York Mayor Robert Wagner and Brooklyn Borough President Frank Cashmore
sponsor a bill to create a Brooklyn Sports Center Authority to build a $30
million sports center in downtown Brooklyn.

The ML owners reject the players' request for an increase in the minimum
salary from $6,000 to $7,000.

1977
The Cubs deal southpaw Darold Knowles to the Rangers for a player to be
named later and cash. The left-hander will post a 5-2 record for Texas,
and outfielder Gene Cline, made part of the trade 10 days later, will help
his new club batting a respectable .293 playing in 101 games for Chicago.

1983
The Royals trade minor league prospect Cecil Fielder to the Blue Jays for
outfielder Leon Roberts. The 32-year-old flycatcher will have two mediocre
seasons in Kansas City before retiring, with Fielder enjoying several
MVP-caliber seasons during his 13-year tenure in the major leagues.

1991
Jack Morris signs a contract with his hometown team, the Minnesota Twins. In
doing so, he turns down a 3-year offer from the Detroit Tigers.

1992
The Pirates name former catcher Ted Simmons as general manager.

1999
Major league baseball will honor each league's best hitter with an award
named after Hank Aaron. The all-time homerun king learns about the honor
on his 65th birthday at an event which includes President Bill Clinton,
Ernie Banks and Reggie Jackson.

2002
Luis Arroyo is inducted into the Latin American Baseball Hall of Fame
Museum. The Puerto Rican reliever, who made the National League All Star
squad as a rookie with the Cardinals in 1955, had an 8-year career mark of
40-32 saving 36 games with a 3.93 ERA and is best remembered for his 1961
season with the Yankees (15-5, 29 saves).

Baseball announces the withdrawal of its plan for contraction this
upcoming season, but the sport is still determined to eliminate two teams
in 2003. Attempts to contract the Twins and Expos this season could not be
accomplished due to a series of legal decisions and fierce opposition from
the Players Association.

Troy Percival's seven-year tenure with Anaheim, which is the longest
on the current roster, will increase as the All-Star reliever signs a
two-year contract extension with the club. The 32-year-old right-hander,
who is the Angels' all-time leader with 210 career saves, converted 39 of
42 save opportunities last season.

The Astros file a motion in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York asking the court to determine whether the
30-year naming agreement with Enron signed in 1999 should continue. The team
does not want to call its stadium Enron Field any longer due to the financial
burden placed on many Houston-area residents caused by the bankrupt energy
company business practices.

2003
Umpire John Hirschbeck, the head of the umpires' union, is given a 10-day
suspension for reportedly making personal threats to Rob Manfred, executive
vice president for labor relations in the commissioner's office. He is the
second umpire in less than a week to be given a 10-day suspension because of
inappropriate comments. Hirschbeck got into a heated telephone conversation
with Manfred last month and made personal threats against him. Hirschbeck
was upset that an acquaintance was one of 26 baseball employees laid off
on January 22.

2004
The Red Sox sign free agent DH Ellis Burks to a contract.

The Padres sign free agent P Antonio Osuna to a contract.

2008
Alex Rios (.297, 24, 85) and the Blue Jays agree on a $4,835,000, one-year
deal which includes a $3.5 million signing bonus with a base salary of
$1,335,000. The 26-year-old All-Star outfielder does not become eligible
for free agency until the end of the 2010 season.

Freddie Sanchez signs an $11 million, two-year contract to continue to play
second base for the Pirates. The 2006 National League batting champ could
add another $8 million in 2010 if Bucs exercise their option to retain
his services.

Scott Podsednik (.243, 2, 11) agrees to a minor league contract with the
Rockies. Best known for his role in the 2005 White Sox World Championship,
the speedy 31-year-old outfielder has been slowed by injuries the past
two seasons.

Vying to stay in the starting rotation, Dave Bush (12-10, 5.12) signs a
$2.55 million one-year deal to pitch for the Brewers. The durable 28-year-old
right-hander, who made at least 31 starts each of the previous two seasons,
can make an additional $50,000 as part of the arbitration agreement if he
pitches 210 innings.

2009
In an arrangement similar to last year, Odalis Perez and the Nationals agree
to a non-guaranteed minor league deal which will reward the southpaw with
an $850,000 major league contract if he makes the club this season during
spring training. The left-hander made 30 starts for Washington a year ago
posting a 7-12 record with a 4.34 ERA for the last-place team.

Joseph Reaves, Dodgers director of international relations, announces the
May 16 regular-season game between the Mexico City Diablos Rojos and the
Monterrey Sultanes will be played at Dodger Stadium. The contest between
the two most storied franchises in Mexico marks the first time the league
has played in the City of Angels.

2010
The Twins and former L.A. infielder Orlando Hudson (.283, 9, 62) agree to
a $5 million one-year contract. The 32-year-old free-agent second baseman,
known as O-Dog, is expected to be the club's number 2 hitter between leadoff
man Denard Span and AL MVP Joe Mauer.

The ball thrown to Alex Rodriguez that he hit for his 500th homerun is sold
at an auction for $103,579 to an anonymous bidder. The historic horsehide,
which cleared the fence at Yankee Stadium on August 4, 2007, was recovered
in a scrum by a Rutgers University student.
