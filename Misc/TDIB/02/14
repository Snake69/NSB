Dave Fultz, president of the Players Fraternity, calls off a strike set to
begin within the week. One of the demands of the union was to abolish the

has been out of action for ten days. Organized Baseball officially severs
relations with the union, leaving the players without representation.

1911
At the NL's annual meeting, the Giants and Phils get an okay for new home
uniforms:  white flannel with a fine stripe, an innovation that predates
the famed Yankee pinstripes. Also introduced is a Reach cork centered ball
and the number of .300 hitters will jump from 8 in 1910 to 27 in 1911 in
the AL. The average ERA will go from 2.53 to 3.34.

decades as a player.

broadcast booth since the team's inaugural season in 1993.

According to the Detroit Free Press major league baseball is informing
umpires to remove pitchers from the game, without warning, who deliberately
throw a beanball at a batter's head. The crackdown, according to officials,
is a clarification and reinforcement of an existing rule.

2002
The Tigers sign Dmitri Young (.302, 21, 69) to a four-year contract with
two team options. The Tigers traded outfielder Juan Encarnacion (.242, 12,
52) and minor league right-hander, Luis Pineda, in December to acquire the
first baseman/outfielder from the Reds.

2003
After much speculation, the Chunichi Dragons return Kevin Millar to the
Marlins for an undisclosed amount of money for relinquishing its rights. After
reconsidering an offer from the Red Sox, the outfielder had a change of
heart and didn't want to play for the Japanese Central League team.

In a letter to the World Umpires Association, baseball says that umpires
whose calls do not match QuesTec at least 90 percent of the time will be
judged as not meeting standards. In response next month, 47 of 68 umpires
sign a statement expressing no confidence in the QuesTec system.

2005
The Twins sign Johan Santana (20-6, 2.61), who was eligible for arbitration,

2007
For the first time at Wrigley Field, the Cubs will allow ads on the green
doors which are located in the ivy in the left-field and right-field bleachers
according to Jay Blunk, director of marketing and sales. Although the team
has been approached by other companies, Under Armour, whose company spokesman
is newly acquired outfielder Alfonso Soriano, is the "right fit" for the
7-by-12 foot signage featuring the performance apparel's signature logo.

2009
The Angels and Bobby Abreu (296, 20, 100) agree to a $5 million, one-year
deal. The 34-year-old free-agent outfielder, taking a significant pay cut
after having a solid season with the Yankees last season, is expected to
add some much-needed punch from the left side for the AL West champions.

2011
Avoiding arbitration, Carlos Marmol agrees to a three-year $20-million deal
with the Cubs. The 28-year-old closer saved 38 games in 43 opportunities
last season along with compiling a 2-3 record and an ERA of 2.55.

The Yankees come to terms with free-agent Andruw Jones on a $1.5-million
one-year contract, eliminating the likelihood of the team resigning Johnny
Damon. 'The Curacao Kid', best known for his outstanding outfield defense
for the Braves at the start of his career, will spend two seasons in the
Bronx, before finishing his 17-year major league tenure with a lifetime
.254 batting average.

2014
Avoiding arbitration, 24-year-old outfielder Jason Heyward and the Braves
agree to a two-year $13.3-million deal. After the season, Atlanta will
trade their 2007 first-round pick (14th overall) along with right-handed
reliever Jordan Walden to the Cardinals for right-handers Tyrell Jenkins
and Shelby Miller.

Freddie Freeman agrees to a franchise-record eight-year $135-million contract,
surpassing the six-year $90-million deal the Braves gave Chipper Jones in
2000. The 24-year-old All-Star first baseman, who finished fifth in the
MVP balloting this season, has hit .285 during his four years with the team
averaging 17 homeruns and 70 RBIs per season.
