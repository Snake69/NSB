1935
Lou Gehrig signs a one-year deal with the Yankees for $30,000, $7,000 less
than he asked for. Last season, the All-Star first baseman hit .363 with
49 homers and lead the American League with 165 RBIs. Gehrig is now the
highest paid player in baseball.

1937
The Giants open their spring training camp in Havana, Cuba.

1942
Hal Trosky, whose season ended last August when he injured his finger, and
suffering from migraine headaches that cannot be treated, retires as first
baseman of the Indians. Trosky will come back to play for the White Sox in
1944 and 1946, but the Hall of Fame brilliance he showed in the 30's is gone.

1946
Giants OF Danny Gardella becomes the first major leaguer to announce he
is jumping to the "outlaw" Mexican League, the first shot in the series
of events that will dominate baseball even more than the return of all the
war veterans. The outfielder goes south of the border lured by a salary of
$10,000, more than double the amount offered by the Giants. His attempt to
return to the ML a few years later will initiate a major court battle.

1953
After being hit by enemy fire during a Korean combat mission, Ted Williams
safely crash lands his Pather jet.

1957
The Kansas City Athletics ship pitchers Art Ditmar, Bobby Shantz, and Jack
McMahan, and infielders Clete Boyer, Curt Roberts and Wayne Belardi to
the Yankees. In return they receive pitchers Maury McDermott, Tom Morgan,
Gary Coleman, and Jack Urban, OF Irv Noren, plus infielders Billy Hunter and
Milt Graff. Roberts didn't go to NYC 'till May 4, while Boyer went a month
later. Hunter and Urban don't switch until April 5. The veteran Shantz and
Boyer will be valuable pickups for New York, with Shantz leading the AL in
ERA this year, and Boyer a tough defensive 3B for 8 years in pinstripes. The
A's will eventually admit that when they signed Boyer for a $40,000 bonus
in 1955, it was on behalf of the Yankees, with the understanding that they'd
later ship him to NY.

1970
Effective April 1st, Tiger pitcher Denny McLain is suspended by Commissioner
Kuhn for his alleged connection with bookmakers. The suspension will last
three months; it was indefinite for a while before its length was set.

1977
The A's sell P Paul Lindblad to the Rangers for $400,000, calling into
question Bowie Kuhn's policy on player sales. Kuhn had previously voided
an Oakland sale of players (6/18/76) as "not being in the best interest of
baseball," but had not specified the amount allowable in a player sale.
The left-handed reliever will appear in 42 games for Texas this season
posting a 4-5 record with an ERA of 4.20.

1983
Fernando Valenzuela becomes the first player to be awarded $1,000,000 via
the arbitration process. The 22-year-old Mexican southpaw has compiled a
career record of 34-20 during his three years with the Dodgers. The Dodgers
had offered Valenzuela $750,000 for the 1983 season.

1987
Less than one month after signing with the club as a free agent, pitcher
Vida Blue stuns the A's by announcing his retirement.

1988
The Padres sign veteran SS Dickie Thon, released by Houston last month.

1995
The Blue Jays assign manager Cito Gaston and his coaching staff to work with
minor league players so that they will not have to deal with replacement
players.

1996
Charles O. Finley, 77, owner of the Athletics from 1960 to 1981, dies. He
moved the team from Kansas City to Oakland, and was known for numerous
gimmicks and controversies. He won three straight World Series from 1972-74.

1998
Shortly after beating Jorge Fabregas in an arbitration case, Arizona owner
Jerry Colangelo stuns the catcher - and fellow owners - by signing him to
a 2-year $2.9 million contract which includes a significant raise over the
arbitration salary in the first year.

2002
The 37-year-old Jose Canseco (.258, 16, 49) signs a minor league contract with
the lame duck Expos. The 17-year veteran, who was the 1985 American League
Rookie of the Year and its 1986 MVP, is 38 homers shy of the coveted 500 mark.

2004
The Pirates sign free agent 1B Randall Simon to a contract.

2008
In a deal which includes a club option worth $10 million, sophomore
Ian Kinsler (.286, 14, 55) signs a five-year $22 million contract with
the Rangers. With the signing of the 24-year-old second baseman and last
season's contract extension for All-Star shortstop Michael Young, Texas
has locked up the middle of their infield through 2013.

2009
Despite his poor performance last season, the Braves give Jeff Francoeur
(.239, 11, 71) a big raise over his previous salary of $460,000 agreeing
to a one-year contract worth $3,375,000 with the outfielder. The deal, a
compromise between their two offers, comes just hours prior to a scheduled
salary arbitration hearing in Arizona.

2010
The Nationals finalize a $2 million one-year deal, that includes the
opportunity to earn up to $3 million in performance-based bonuses, with
former Yankee pitcher Chien-Ming Wang (1-6, 9.64 ERA). The 29-year-old
right-hander, who hasn't been the same since injuring his foot running the
bases in a 2008 interleague game against Houston, underwent shoulder surgery
last July and is not expected to pitch in the first few months of the season.

2012
At the Bell Centre, Canadiens mascot Youppi! wears his jersey with the Expos
colors in place of his usual bleu-blanc-rouge (blue, white and red) to honor
the memory of former major league catcher Gary Carter, who died this week as
the result of a brain tumor. The 57-year-old Hall of Famer, the only player
enshrined as an Expo, and Youppi! played key roles for the National League
team before the franchise left Montreal to move to Washington, D.C. in 1995.

2014
Avoiding arbitration, Homer Bailey (11-12, 3.49) and the Reds agree to
a $105-million six-year deal including a $25-million mutual option for
2020. The 27-year-old starter from Texas, the author of two major league
no-hitters, will continue to be part of Cincinnati's young rotation that
includes Johnny Cueto, Mat Latos, Mike Leake and southpaw Tony Cingrani,
who are all under the age of 30.
