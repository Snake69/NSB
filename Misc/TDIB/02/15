by the NL Board of Directors in New York, but he is found guilty of bad
conduct and fined $300.

1910
Both major leagues adopt resolutions banning syndicate baseball, which
allowed owners to have financial interests in more than one team. The
NL votes for a 154-game schedule to open on April 12th, which the AL has
already adopted. Other rules:  umpires must announce all team changes to
spectators; batting orders must be delivered to the umpire at home plate
before the game; a batter is out if he crosses the plate from one batter's
box to the other while the pitcher is in position to pitch; a base runner
is out if he passes another runner before the latter has been put out.

1940
The Tiger roster lists Hank Greenberg as an OF. The willingness of the
team's leading power hitter to switch, at a contract boost, from 1B allows
manager Del Baker to find a position for Rudy York. Also on the list are
Dick Bartell, picked up from the Cubs for Billy Rogell, and Pinky Higgins,
who had been shopped around. The four, along with Barney McCosky and Charlie
Gehringer, produce the stuff that will move the Tigers from fifth to first,
although its .588 mark will be as low as that of any pennant-winner yet.

1945
Billy Southworth Jr, the son of Cards manager Billy Southworth, is killed
when his B29 crashes into the water off Flushing, New York. The 27-year-old
was a veteran of 25 missions in Europe, and was the first player in organized
baseball to enlist in WW2. The young Southworth was a well regarded outfielder
with the Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) in 1940.

of the Year.

Southern California College of Cosa Mesa, she 5-hits Claremont-Mudd-Scripps,
12-1.

policy of no facial hair for players. The change is the result of a talk
between owner Marge Schott and newly-acquired OF Greg Vaughn.

2000
The Boston Red Sox sign outfielder Carl Everett to a three-year contract.

2001
The Padres sign free agent P Bobby Jones to a one-year contract for
$625,000. Jones left the Mets after 7+ seasons, declining a Mets offer
of salary arbitration that would have netted him, at worst, $2 or $3
million. Last year Jones, 11-4, made $5.25M.

The Yanks sign Henry Rodriguez, to a one year contract. The agreement
was reached a month ago and H-Rod is already listed in the team's spring
training program.

San Diego Padres OF Mike Darr is killed in an early morning accident when
his car rolls over in Phoenix near the team's spring training camp. Surviving
is pitcher Ben Howard, who was sitting in the back seat wearing a seatbelt.

2003
After Japan's Chunichi Dragons released him for an undisclosed payment,
the Red Sox acquire Kevin Millar (.306, 16, 57) from the Marlins for $1.2
million, along with an additional $300,000 that will go to charity. The
31-year-old first baseman-outfielder, who had originally agreed to a two-year,
$6.2 million deal to play in Japan, had a change of heart after at first
rejecting Boston's waiver claim for him made in January. The Marlins had
sold Millar to the Dragons for $1.2 million last month.

2006
According to Adam Katz, Sammy Sosa's agent, the 37-year-old slugger will
probably retire eleven homeruns shy of becoming the fifth major leaguer
to hit 600 round-trippers. Earlier, the Dominican outfielder rejected a
non-guaranteed contract from the Nationals that included performance bonuses.

Former Dodgers starter, Jeff Weaver (14-11, 4.22), agrees to a one-year
contract with the other team with Los Angeles in its name. The deal for the
last major player left on the free agent market is worth $8,325,000, and
the 29-year-old right-hander can earn an additional $600,000 in performance
bonuses for innings pitched and game starts with the Angels.

2007
Ending more than two months of speculation about Barry Bonds' deal with
the Giants, the commissioner's office approves the one-year contract worth
$15.8 million. The 42-year-old slugger had reached a preliminary agreement
with the team early in December, but finalizing the contract was delayed
because of language about promotional appearances and a clause was added
stating the Giants could void the deal if the outfielder was indicted due
to the use of steroids.

The Yankees announce the team will wear black armbands on the left sleeve of
their uniforms in memory of teammate Cory Lidle. The 34-year-old right-hander,
along with flight instructor Tyler Stanger, died when their plane crashed
into a 52-story high-rise apartment building in Manhattan on a rain-swept
afternoon last October.

2012
The Rays and Joe Maddon agree on a three-year contract extension that
will keep the two-time American League manager of the year with Tampa
Bay through the 2015 season. During his six-year tenure with the club,
the 58-year-old skipper has compiled a 495-477 (.509) record leading the
team to the postseason three times in the last four years, including an
American League pennant in 2008.

2016
"Baseball is known as our national pastime, but the game has deep roots and a
rich history here in New York State. From the National Baseball Hall of Fame
and Museum in storied Cooperstown to the Mets and Yankees - the pinnacles of
Major League Baseball, to our recently crowned Little League World Series
champions from Maine-Endwell, New York State is clearly the epicenter of
baseball greatness. It is time that we formally recognize baseball as our
official state sport." - James Seward, New York state senator. New York
State Sen. James Seward (R-Milford), thanks to a suggestion from a group of
fourth-graders at Cooperstown Elementary School, announces he has introduced
legislation (S.4288) to designate baseball as New York’s official state
sport. In a press release, Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson says he
"enthusiastically supports” the proposed bill, citing Cooperstown serves
as the spiritual home of baseball.
