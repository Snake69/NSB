1909
Hall of Fame hurler John Clarkson, a 326-game winner, dies from pneumonia
in Belmont, MA at the age of 47. The right-hander pitched for Worcester
Ruby Legs (1882), Chicago White Stockings (1884-1887), Boston Beaneaters
(1888-1892), and Cleveland Spiders (1892-1894).

1915
The Yankees purchase Wally Pipp and OF Hugh High from the Detroit Tigers
for a reported $5,000 each. Historian Lyle Spatz (Yankees Coming, Yankees
Going) writes that this was the first of some promised funneling of ball
players to the recently sold Yankee franchise.

1922
Joe Harris, formerly with Cleveland, is reinstated by Judge Landis because
of his good war record. Harris had been on the ineligible list for having
played with and against ineligible players in independent games. "His
service in France, where he was gassed after bitter fighting, caused him
to do things he might not have done," says Judge Landis in reinstating him.

1925
Brooklyn acquires OF Cotton Tierney from the Braves for OF Bernie Neis.

1934
The National Recovery Administration says athletes advertising athletic
goods must actually use them or advertisers will lose the NRA Blue Eagle
and be fined.

1956
During spring training, the American League plans to test automatic
intentional walks. The concept will not be used in the major leagues, but will
be implemented over time for use in some youth leagues and scholastic teams.

The Major Leagues vote to establish the Cy Young Memorial Award for
outstanding pitcher of the year.

1957
The BBWAA elects manager Joe McCarthy and Detroit's Wahoo Sam Crawford to
the Hall of Fame.

1958
The Hall of Fame fails to elect any new members for the first time since 1950.

1960
Although the top 13 vote-getters will eventually be inducted, the BBWAA
doesn't elect a Hall of Fame candidate for the 2nd straight year and the
fifth time in 24 years. Edd Roush gets 146 votes, but 202 are necessary
for election. Sam Rice (143) and Eppa Rixey (142) are next in line. The
fact no one receives the necessary 75 percent to be selected may be more
of a reflection of too many qualified candidates splintering the vote,
rather than the lack of a player on the ballot deserving recognition.

The Giants move their offices to Candlestick Park. They will work out of
a locker room until the San Francisco facility is completed.

1969
Bowie Kuhn, a compromise choice, is selected by the major league owners
to be baseball's fifth commissioner. He is elected on a pro-tem basis but
will hold the position until 1984. The former National League attorney,
a future Hall of Famer for the role he will play during a turbulent time
in the game, replaces William Eckert.

1971
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announces former Negro League players will have a
separate wing in the Hall of Fame. Due to the controversy the announcement
causes, it is decided inclusion in the regular Hall of Fame is more fitting
and more of an honor for the former black players.

1976
Federal Judge John W. Oliver of the United States district court for Western
Missouri upholds Peter Seitz' arbitration ruling which made Andy Messersmith
and Dave McNally free agents. The Dodgers and Expos pitchers challenged
the reserved clause by playing, but not signing their contracts contending
they were now free to sign with another team for next season, negating the
owner's belief that the one-year contracts were perpetually renewed.

1984
The Yankees obtain third baseman Toby Harrah and minor leaguer Rick Brown
from the Indians for P George Frazier, rookie outfielder Otis Nixon and
minor leaguer Guy Elston. The team's new third baseman will hit just .217
in the one season he plays for the Bronx Bombers, but Nixon will go on to
have a solid 17-year major league career leaving the game in 1999 with a
lifetime batting average .270.

1990
The St. Petersburg Pelicans defeat the West Palm Beach Tropics to win the
first Senior Professional Baseball Association Championship, 12-4. Former
major leaguers Steve Kemp and Lamar Johnson go deep for the newly crowned
champs.

1991
The Hall of Fame board of directors vote unanimously, 12-0, to accept
the proposal presented last month by a special committee which excludes
any player on the permanently ineligible list. The decision will ban Pete
Rose's name from being placed on the HOF ballot. Rose can become eligible
again only if the commissioner reinstates him by December, 2005.

1998
Free agent DH-OF Jose Canseco signs a 1-year contract with the Blue Jays.

2000
The Mets sign free agent vet Dennis Springer to a contract.

2002
The Minnesota Supreme Court refuses to consider an appeal of an injunction
that forces the Twins to fulfill their Metrodome lease in 2002. The decision
puts an end for this season to any possibility of contraction in major
league baseball.

2004
Avoiding an arbitration hearing, the Cardinals and Albert Pujols (.359,
43, 124) agree to a $100 million, seven-year deal. The 24-year-old slugging
first baseman/outfielder was the runner up to Barry Bonds of the Giants in
the National League MVP voting.

2005
Needing to fill the void created by the departure of Sammy Sosa and Moises
Alou, the Cubs avoid arbitration signing Aramis Ramirez (.318, 36, 103)
to a $8.95 million, one-year contract. The 26-year-old third baseman was
selected to the National League All-Star team last season.

A dentist, who became partially blind after being struck attempting to catch
a foul ball, is appealing his case in which he alleges the Phillies need to
provide more protection for fans. The case, demised by a Philadelphia Common
Pleas judge citing that multiple warnings were made by the club, including
public address announcements, text on the back of the ticket, and posted
signs in the ballpark, will now be heard in the state's Commonwealth Court.

The Rangers sign free agent P Pedro Astacio to a contract.

2008
Curtis Granderson (.302, 23, 74) and the Tigers come to terms on a five-year
contract which includes a club option for 2013 worth $30.25 million. Joining
Willie Mays and Frank Schulte, the 26-year-old outfielder last season
became the third player in major league history to swipe 20 bases, and hit
at least 20 homers, 20 triples and 20 doubles.

2009
Brian Bannister and the Royals avoid salary arbitration agreeing to a one-year
deal valued at $1,737,500. The right-hander, who was 9-16 with a 5.76 ERA
in 32 starts for Kansas City in his sophomore season, placed third in the
AL Rookie of the Year voting in 2007 after being obtained from the Mets.

The Brewers trade C Eric Fryer to the Yankees for P Chase Wright.

2010
Justin Verlander and the Tigers finalized an $80 million, five-year deal
that keeps the talented hurler in the Motor City until 2014. The 26-year-old
right-hander has compiled a 65-43 record along with a 3.92 ERA during his
first four years in the major leagues, all with Detroit.

2014
The Diamondbacks announce the contracts of general manager Kevin Towers and
skipper Kirk Gibson have been extended, but do not disclose the length and
financial terms which were given. The extensions prevent the club's brain
trust from being lame ducks, with both men having just a year remaining on
their current deal with Arizona, which they signed after the team's 2011
National League West championship season.

2015
Sarah Hudek, daughter of former major leaguer, All-Star right-hander John
Hudek, announces she has signed a letter of intent to play baseball for
Louisianaâ€™s Bossier Parish Community College, making her one of the first
females to ever compete at the collegiate level. The 5-foot-10, 150-pound
teenage southpaw, whose fastball has been clocked at 82 mph, is as good
as or even better than some of the males on the team, according to BPCC
coach Aaron Vorachek.

Carlos Delgado, who enjoyed eight consecutive 30-homer seasons with the Blue
Jays, while becoming the team's all-time leader in home runs (336), RBIs
(1,058) and runs (889) will be inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of
Fame in June. The Class of 2015 will also feature former Canadian players
Corey Koskie and Matt Stairs, longtime Montreal Expos skipper Felipe Alou,
along with Toronto Sun columnist Bob Elliott, recipient of the 2012 Spink
Award given by the National Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
