2006
Alex Gonzalez, who signed with the Red Sox as a free agent yesterday,
singles in the tying run and then scores the winning run as Henry Blanco's
pop fly bounces off the head off Erick Aybar giving Venezuela its first

Republic Licey Tigers' shortstop lost in the lights, is ruled a double
and caps a two-run bottom of the ninth rally resulting in a 5-4 comeback
victory for the Caracas Lions.

The Diamondbacks sign free agent OF Jeff DaVanon to a contract.

2009

inductees at its June 23 ceremony in St. Marys, Ontario, along with former

and the 2011 Pan Am Games gold-medal winning Team Canada senior squad. The
former Expos outfielder, referred to as the Le Grand Orange by the Montreal
fans because of his red hair, was a fan favorite in the early days of the
franchise due to his work ethic and for his active role in promoting the
game north of the border.

Avoiding arbitration, Elvis Andrus and the Rangers come to terms on a
three-year $14.6 million contract. The agreement gives the 23-year-old

playing A-ball, their starting shortstop in a couple of years.

2014
Alex Rodriguez, who has consistently denied the use of banned substances while
wearing Yankee pinstripes, drops his two lawsuits against MLB, ending the
likelihood of a long drawn-out legal battle over his season-long suspension
handed down for the alleged use of performance-enhancing substances. The Bronx
Bomber third baseman was one of 14 individuals suspended due to baseball's
investigation of a Florida anti-aging clinic, but was the only player to
contest his penalty, which was the longest ever given for using PEDs.
