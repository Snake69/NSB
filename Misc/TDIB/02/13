1914
The Cubs exchange second basemen with the Braves sending future Hall of
Famer Johnny Evers to Boston for Bill Sweeeny. Boston gets the better of
the deal when their new middle infielder plays a pivotal role in the club's
World Championship this season, garnering the Chalmers Award as the Most
Valuable Player of the league.

1917
Tim Murnane, 64, 1B on the original Boston NL team of 1876 and later a
leading Boston baseball writer, dies in Boston.

1934
In an item discovered by historian Doug Pappas, the NL loans the Cincinnati
Reds $50,000 at 4.5% interest. Powel Crosley, who bought the team 10 days
ago, will repay the Reds' debt in full by 1938.

1935
Signing a contact written in French, Senator outfielder Gus Dugas, a
French-Canadian, is obtained by Montreal of the International League.

1953
In honor of their longtime owner and manager, the A's rename their
Philadelphia ballpark from Shibe Park to Connie Mack Stadium. During
his 50-year tenure as Athletics skipper, the 'Tall Tactician' guided the
team to nine American League pennants and appeared in eight World Series,
winning five of the Fall Classics.

1968
The White Sox trade SS Ron Hansen and pitchers Dennis Higgins and Steve
Jones to Washington for pitchers Bob Priddy and Les Narum and IF Tim Cullen.

The Giants trade C Tom Haller and P Frank Kasheta to the Dodgers for
infielders Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver. This is the first trade between the
2 clubs since 1956 when Jackie Robinson was sent to the Giants but retired
instead. Haller, an All-Star, will spend four years in L.A.

1970
A day after his 27th birthday, Paul Edmondson and his girlfriend are killed in
an automobile accident in San Barbara, California when his automobile skids
on a rain-slicked U.S. Route 101 and crashes into oncoming traffic. The
White Sox had hoped their sophomore right-hander, who debuted with a 9-1
two-hitter over California this past season, would become the fourth starter
in the team's rotation, after compiling a misleading 1-6 record last season.

The NL offices begin their move from Cincinnati to San Francisco, which
will be completed February 23rd.

1974
Speedster James "Cool Papa" Bell is named for Hall of Fame honors by the
Special Committee on the Negro Leagues.

1986
Keep the uniforms? Two months after being traded from the Yankees to the
White Sox, C Ron Hassey is traded back to the Yankees along with 3 minor
leaguers in exchange for P Neil Allen, C Scott Bradley, and minor leaguer
Glen Braxton. But Hassey will again go back to the White Sox on July 30th.

1987
Jack Morris is awarded the highest salary ever given to a pitcher by
arbitration when the Tigers must pay the hurler $1.85 million for his services
next season (arbitrator, Richard Bloch). The 31-year-old right-hander will
not disappoint posting an 18-11 record along with an ERA of 3.38 for the
AL East Division champions.

1992
Oakland outfielder Jose Canseco rams his wife's car, causing $10,000 in
damage, following an argument with his wife, Esther.

1995
The Dodgers sign five-time Japanese all-star pitcher, Hideo Nomo, for
a reported $2 million bonus. 'Tornado Boy' is the first player to move
directly from the majors in Japan to the North American majors.

1996
The Cardinals complete a long-rumored swap, acquiring Dennis Eckersley, 42,
from the A's in exchange for minor leaguer Steve Montgomery. Eck replaces
Tom Henke, who announced last month he was retiring.

The Cards announce that they are laying nearly three acres of natural
grass over the field at Busch Stadium, replacing the artificial turf that
has been used for 26 years. The turf will be ready for the April 8 opener
against Montreal.

2002
The Red Sox sign 43-year-old Rickey Henderson to a minor-league contract. Last
season with the Padres, the future Hall of Famer got his 3000th career hit
and broke the all-time records for walks and runs.

2003
The Mets sign 40-year-old David Cone to a minor league contract. The
right-hander, who compiled an 80-48 record with the team from 1987-1992,
is coming out of retirement hoping to win the fifth spot in the rotation.

2005
Avoiding arbitration, Ben Sheets (12-14, 2.70) and the Brewers agree to a
one-year contract valued at $5.5 million. The all-star right hander, who
made $2.5 million last season, established a team record last May striking
out 18 batters.

After 19 years at shortstop for the Reds, Barry Larkin, announces his
retirement as an active player, to become special assistant to Nationals'
general manager Jim Bowden. The 40-year-old former Gold Glove infielder
spent his entire career in Cincinnati, his hometown.

The White Sox trade OF Alex Escobar to the Nationals for OF Jerry Owens.

2006
Avoiding an arbitration hearing, Adam Dunn (.247, 40, 101) and the Reds agreed
to a $18.5 million two-year deal and gives the team a 2008 option for $13
million with a buy out for $500,000. The 26-year-old outfielder/first baseman,
who led the big leagues for the second consecutive season in strikeouts,
had asked for $8.95 million with the club countering with $7.1 million.

2008
Takashi Saito (2-1, 1.40), who signed a minor league deal with the Dodgers
two years ago after playing 14 seasons in the Japanese Central League with
the Yokohama Bay Stars, agrees to a $2 million, one-year contract to stay
with Los Angeles. The 37-year-old All Star closer had 39 saves in 43 chances
last season.

In a much anticipated congressional hearing, Roger Clemens and his former
personal trainer, Brian McNamee, testify for 4 1/2 hours concerning the
allegations of the Rocket's use of performance-enhancing drugs. Although
no definitive conclusions are reached, Republicans appear to believe the
seven-time Cy Young Award winner while Democrats seem to favor his chief
accuser's account of events.

2009
In an effort to avoid abitration for the remainder of his career, Ryan Howard
agrees to a three-year, $54 million deal with Philadelphia. The Phillies
slugger, who led the major leagues in homeruns (48) and RBIs (146), was
unable to reach a contract settlement in less than friendly negotiations
with the team and was awarded $10 million by arbitrators during the 2008
off-season, tieing the highest sum ever given to a player in the process.

2012
In a deal confirmed by his agent, Yoenis Cespedes has reached a four-year
$36 million agreement with the A's, pending the results of a physical. The
Cuban defector, who is slotted to play center field moving Coco Crisp to
left, hit .458 with a double, three triples, two homeruns and five RBIs in
the six games he played in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.
