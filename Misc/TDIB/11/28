The Diamondbacks trade ace Curt Schilling to the Red Sox for pitcher Casey
Fossum, Brandon Lyon and 2 minor leaguers. Schilling negotiates his own
contract with the Red Sox. Reportedly, the Yankees offered more than the Red

Agreeing to a deal which pays him the highest average salary for a reliever in
baseball history, left-handed Billy Wagner is offered a $43 million four-year

contract calls for the largest amount of money ever given to a reliever.

Due to the 15-year restriction, Pete Rose is no longer eligible for possible
inclusion on the baseball writers' Hall of Fame ballot. The all-time hits

2007
In a six-player trade, the Twins obtain outfielder Delmon Young, infielder
Brendan Harris and outfield prospect Jason Pridie from the Rays in exchange
for right-handed starter Matt Garza, starting shortstop Jason Bartlett
and pitching prospect Eduardo Morlan. The acquisition of the 22-year-old
turbulent Tampa Bay outfielder, who was admonished by his manager last
season for not hustling, will help Minnesota fill the void created by free
agent Torri Hunter's departure to the Angels.

The White Sox sign free agent Scott Linebrink (5-6, 3.71) to a four-year
$19 million contract which is considered by many to be a very lucrative
deal for a middle-reliever. Chicago plans to use the former Padres/Brewers
reliever in an eighth-inning set-up role to get to closer Bobby Jenks.

2011
Less than a week after obtaining the Astros from Drayton McLane, new owner
Jim Crane fires GM Ed Wade and team president Tal Smith. In a statement

club's interim general manager until a replacement can be found.

The Rays sign veteran backstop Jose Molina to a one-year $1.5-million contract
that includes a club option at the same amount for the 2013 season. The
36-year-old catcher, known for his outstanding defensive skills, hit a
career-best .281 last season with Toronto.
