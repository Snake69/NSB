from its teams, and is perceived as a precursor to the circuit becoming a
third major league.

In a controversial vote, the writers name Cubs slugger Hank Sauer as the
NL MVP. The Cubs finished in 5th place, despite Sauer's 37 HRs and 121

tickled pink. I thought maybe the other guy, Roberts, would win it." Sauer

1986) and Ryan Howard (2006) to win the MVP in the senior circuit playing
in Philadelphia.
