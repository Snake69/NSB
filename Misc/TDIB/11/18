Nov 18

1907
Charles W. Murphy, owner of the Chicago Cubs, says he was misquoted in the
Tribune yesterday. He in fact is advocating extending the World Series from
a 4 out of 7 game series to a 7 out of 9 series. He is not in favor of the
best 9 out of 11 series as stated in the newspaper.

1909
In Cuba, righty Eustaquio "Bombin" Pedroso no-hits the AL champion Detroit
Tigers for 11 innings, finally winning, 2-1. The only run for Detroit comes
on an error in the 7th. A squeeze bunt against Bill Lelivelt in the 11th
scores the winner. A collection is taken up for Pedroso and fans, including
several Tigers, contribute $300. The Tigers, playing without Ty Cobb and
Sam Crawford, win 4 of 12 games against Havana and Almendares.

1914
The Cubs hire future Hall of Famer Roger Bresnahan to manage the team. The
former Cardinal skipper will stay for just a year as Chicago finishes the
season in fourth place with a 73-80 record.

1924
Oakland Oaks (PCL) owner Cal Ewing announces that he has sold the team
to Washington Senators star Walter Johnson, represented by George Weiss,
who deposited a check for $5,000 towards the purchase. Last month, Ewing
announced that the sale price was an enthusiastic $450,000 (the St. Louis
Cardinals recent sale was for $275,000). Nothing will come of all the talk,
and Johnson will return to the Washington team.

1934
Al Schacht leaves Washington to join Boston as a coach, breaking up the
clown act he had performed with Nick Altrock.

resignation to "devote all my time to war-essential business."

1947
The Browns trade All-Star shortstop Vern Stephens and pitcher Jack Kramer to
the Red Sox for six players and $310,000. The dealing will continue tomorrow
as Ellis Kinder and Billy Hitchcock also go to Boston in exchange for three
more St. Louis players (Sam Dente, Clem Dreisewerd and Bill Sommers) and
$65,000, making the total number of players traded 13 (4 Browns, 9 Red Sox)
along with $375,000 going to the cash deprived Browns. Kinder will win 23
games in 1949.

1949
Jackie Robinson (.342, 16, 124) becomes the first black player to win the MVP
Award. Stan Musial, Ralph Kiner and teammate Pee Wee Reese are the runner ups.

1951
Former Cubs 1B and future TV star of The Rifleman Chuck Connors is the first
player to oppose the ML draft. Currently the 1B of the Los Angeles Angels
(PCL), Connors wants to stay in California, instead of going to whatever
team might draft him for the ML. The PCL views his refusal in a positive
manner, allowing them to ask higher prices for players than what the ML
usually offers.

1954
The A's hire Lou Boudreau to replace skipper Eddie Joost, who is given his
unconditional release as a player-manager. During his three-year tenure in
Kansas City, the future Hall of Famer will pilot the second-division club
to a 151-260 record.

In an enormous two-part trade begun on November 14, the Yankees and Orioles
exchange 17 players. Included are 1B Dick Kryhoski, Ps Bob Turley and
Don Larsen and SS Billy Hunter from Baltimore. To the Orioles go OF Gene
Woodling, SS Willie Miranda, Ps Harry Byrd and Jim McDonald, and Cs Gus
Triandos and Hal Smith. The trade will help both teams.

1958
In a power struggle that has been brewing for some time within the Cleveland
Indians organization, minority stockholders, led by Hank Greenberg, sell
their stock to the majority stockholder, Chairman William Daley, who
controls about 34 percent of the stock. Greenberg had proposed to Daley
that he either buy Greenberg's group stock or sell his stock to the group.

Red Schoendienst of the Braves is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He'll miss

Jim Perry is a distant 2nd.

Wes Westrum is named the Mets manager for 1966.

1966
After finishing the Cy Young season with a 27-9 record and a league-leading
1.73 ERA, Sandy Koufax shocks the baseball world by announcing his retirement
at the age of 30. The southpaw, who has thrown four no-hitters and set the
single-season strikeout record last year with 382, cites his arthritic arm
and the fear of permanent damage as the reason for placing himself on the
voluntarily retired list.

Replacing the legendary Casey Stengel (175-404, .302), the Mets name Wes
Westrum as the team's second manager in the franchise's brief history. The
former Giant catcher had taken over the club reins after the 'Old Perfessor'
had fractured his hip in July.

1970
Johnny Bench wins the NL MVP Award with 326 points, 108 more than the Cubs'
Billy Williams. Bench had 45 homers, 148 RBIs, and a .293 average for the
Reds. His 355 total bases is a record for a C, one that will be tied by
Mike Piazza in 1997.

1974
In a three-way deal, San Diego trades slugger Nate Colbert to Detroit for
Ed Brinkman, Bob Strampe and Dick Sharon. Brinkman is then packaged with
Danny Breeden and shipped to St. Louis, and the Cards send Ps Alan Foster,
Rich Folkers and Sonny Siebert to the Padres. None of the new Padres have
a prayer, while the ailing Colbert, who set a record in 1972 by driving in
22.75% of his team's runs, will prove that his 1974 average of .207 was no
fluke. He and Brinkman will play for three teams in 1975.

1976
The Yankees sign free agent P Don Gullett for $2 million. The oft-injured
Gullett will go 14-4 in 1977, but spend most of the next three seasons on
the injured list.

1980
Despite having missed 45 games with injuries, George Brett is named AL
MVP. The 27-year-old third sacker's .390 average was the highest in the
ML since Ted Williams' .406 in 1941. He added 24 homeruns and 118 RBIs to
lead Kansas City to its first AL pennant. Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage
and Willie Wilson also receive first-place votes.

The Yankees trade C Brad Gulden and cash to Seattle for infielder Larry
Milbourne and a player to be named. That player will turn out to be Gulden,
who Seattle will ship back to the Yanks on May 18, 1981.

1981
Mike Schmidt (.316, 31, 91) becomes the third player in National League
history to win consecutive Most Valuable Payer Awards. Schmidt led the league
in runs and walks in this abbreviated season. The Phillies slugging third
baseman joins Ernie Banks (Cubs, 1958-59) and Joe Morgan (Reds, 1975-76)
in winning the honor in back-to-back seasons.

Dick Williams, fired by the Expos on September 7th, is named manager of
the last-place Padres, replacing Frank Howard. It is the 5th club Williams
has managed since taking over the Red Sox in 1967. The future Hall of Fame
skipper, who has won three pennants and two World Series in 14 years as a
major league pilot, will lead San Diego to a National League pennant in 1984.

1984
Dwight Gooden becomes the second consecutive Met player to be named the
National League's Rookie of Year. The 19-year-old right-hander, who compiled
17-9 record along with a 1.53 ERA and a league-leading 268 strikeouts,
joins his teammate and close friend Darryl Strawberry to be honored with
the coveted freshman award.

1985
Pitching phenoms 20-year-old Dwight Gooden (Mets - NL) and 21-year-old Bret
Saberhagen (Royals - AL) win the Cy Young Award. Both become the youngest
players in their respective leagues to win the coveted pitching honor.

Willie McGee wins the NL MVP Award, capping a season in which he led the
league in batting average (.353) and hits (216) and also stole 56 bases
for St. Louis.

1986
Red Sox Roger Clemens is selected for the American League's MVP Award
becoming the first pitcher to accomplish the feat since Vida Blue won the
honor in 1971. The 'Rocket' receives 19 of the 28 first-place votes and
Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly is the runner-up.

1987
Cubs outfielder Andre Dawson (.287, 49, 137) becomes the first player to
win the MVP award as a member of a last place club.

the first five-million dollar a year player in major league baseball history.

be named to the Mets in exchange for OF Jeromy Burnitz and P Joe Roa.

1997
The expansion draft for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks
is held in Phoenix, Arizona. Florida pitcher Tony Saunders is taken with
the 1st pick by the Devil Rays, while the Diamondbacks select pitcher Brian
Anderson from Cleveland. Following the draft, the Diamondbacks acquire 3B
Travis Fryman from the Tigers in exchange for IFs Joe Randa and Gabe Alvarez
and P Matt Drews. They also obtain OF Devon White from the Marlins for P
Jesus Martinez. In a rash of moves, the Devil Rays get 1B Fred McGriff from
the Braves for a player to be named, C John Flaherty from the Padres for P
Brian Boehringer, and IF Andy Sheets and SS Kevin Stocker from the Phillies
for Bobby Abreu, and sign free agent P Roberto Hernandez to a 4-year contract.

In one of their best swaps ever, the Red Sox obtain Cy Young Award winner
Pedro Martinez from the Expos in exchange for P Carl Pavano and a player
to be named.

Westbrook and John Nicholson, and OF Mike Hamlin.

was runner-up for team MVP to Rafael Palmeiro.

2000
The Mariners sign Orix Blue Wave's Ichiro Suzuki to a three-year deal making
him the first Japanese position player in major league history. Although
terms of the contract were not disclosed, Seattle agrees to pay $13 million
to his former team for the right to negotiate with Japan's best hitter.

2002
The Braves, Marlins and Rockies complete a three-team trade which sends
starting pitcher Mike Hampton and outfielder Juan Pierre to Florida with
backstop Charles Johnson, outfielder Preston Wilson, southpaw reliever Vic
Darensbourg and infield prospect Pablo Ozuna to Colorado. The Marlins then
send Hampton to the Braves in exchange for righty reliever Tim Spooneybarger
and pitching prospect Ryan Baker. Spooneybarger had a 2.63 ERA in 51 games
as a 22-year-old rookie (he also pitched in 4 games in 2001). Baker, 24,
had a 3.72 ERA in class A. When the financial dust clears, the cash-strapped
Rockies move a 6-year $84.5 million commitment they had to Hampton, plus the
3-year $6.6 million commitment they had to Pierre. In return they take on
$1.1 million due Darensbourg, a 3-year $25 million commitment to Johnson as
well as a 3-year $28 million contract of Wilson. They also will pay Atlanta
$11 million left on Hampton's contract. Colorado saves $26 million over the
next 6 years. Florida agrees to pay $34 million on Hampton's contract and
takes on Pierre's contract. The net savings to Florida is $13.5 million. The
Braves have Hampton for 6 years at a cost of $39.5 million.

2003
Barry Bonds wins his record 6th MVP award, and his 3rd in a row. Bonds
becomes the 2nd-oldest player to win the honor as he outdistances runner-up
Albert Pujols of the Cardinals.

The Athletics trade P Ted Lilly to the Blue Jays in exchange for OF Bobby
Kielty, acquired from the Twins for Shannon Stewart in mid season, and
either $10,000 or a minor league player to be named.

The Blue Jays sign free agent P Pat Hentgen to a contract.

2004
Although the Expos may not know where they are playing next season (the final
MLB approval for Washington, DC has been postponed) or the team's new name,
the former Montreal franchise will know who is the club's manager. Frank
Robinson, after compiling a 233-253 record despite many restrictions and
hardships, will return to the helm for his fourth year as the skipper of
this nomad ship.

The Tigers sign free agent P Troy Percival to a 2-year contract, leaving
the A's in need of a closer.

2005
The Mets send OF Mike Cameron to the Padres. In return, NY gets OF/1B
Xavier Nady.

The Nationals sign free agent INF/OF Marlon Anderson to a 2-year deal.

2008
Joining Cal Ripken Jr (Orioles - 1983) and Ryan Howard (Phillies - 2006),
Dustin Pedroia (.326, 17, 83) becomes the third player in major league history
to win the Most Valuable Player award a season after being selected as the
Rookie of the Year. The scrappy Gold Glove second baseman, the 10th Red Sox
player to earn the American League honor, received 16 of the 28 first-place
votes to easily outdistance heavy-hitting Twins first baseman Justin Morneau
(.300, 23, 129).

Ryan Dempster (17-6, 2.96) and the Cubs agree to a $52 million four-year
deal. The 31-year-old right-handed stater had been the club's closer saving
87 games in 102 chances during 2005-07 seasons.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice introduces Ken Griffey Jr as an American
Public Diplomacy Envoy, a position in which the future Hall of Famer will
represent the "values of the United States, not the government of the United
States". The free-agent outfielder, who played for the Reds and White Sox
last season, joins Cal Ripken Jr as a major leaguer serving his country in
the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.

2009
Jim Tracy is named the National League Manager of the Year becoming the
just the second person to cop the honor after taking over a team during the
season, joining Jack McKeon for the 2003 Marlins. The 53-year-old skipper,
who piloted the Rockies to the NL Wild card from 14 1/2 game deficit on
May 29, is rewarded by Colorado with a three-year contract.

Mike Scioscia is named the AL Manager of the Year for the second time. The
50-year-old Angels skipper, who piloted the club to its third consecutive
division title and sixth postseason appearance in the last eight years,
guided Los Angeles past a myriad of injuries to key players and helped
to ease the team's deep sorrow caused by the sudden death of starter Nick
Adenhart in a fatal car accident in April just hours after the 22-year-old
had earned a victory for the team.

2010
A day after he is selected as the American League Manager of the Year,
Ron Gardenhire accepts a a two-year extension through the 2013 season from
the Twins. The 53-year-old skipper, who has won six division titles in his
nine years with the team, has compiled a record of 803-656 (.550) during
his tenure in Minnesota.

Free-agent backstop John Buck signs a three-year $18 million contract to
catch for the Marlins, the team that sought his services a minute after
free agency opened. The signing of the 30-year-old catcher, who enjoyed a
career year with the Blue Jays, hitting .281 with 20 homeruns, continues
Florida's active participation in the early off-season, that also includes
the acquisition of four relievers and an infielder.

Despite an unspectacular 13-12 record, Felix Hernandez is named the American
League Cy Young Award winner ahead of Tampa Bay's David Price (19-6) and
New York's CC Sabathia (21-7). King Felix' league-leading 2.27 ERA and the
lack of run support provided by the last-place Mariners made the Seattle
ace an easy choice for the Baseball Writers' Association of America, who
placed him first on 21 of the 28 ballots cast.

2011
The Cubs introduce Dale Sveum as the fifth-place team's new manager replacing
Mike Quade, who was fired at the end of the season by Chicago's new GM
Theo Epstein. The 52nd manager in franchise history, whose managerial
experience consists of sixteen games as Milwaukee's interim skipper in
2008, is considered a no-nonsense baseball lifer who will stress the
game's fundamentals while implementing "high standards of accountability"
for the players.

2013
Tim Hudson agrees to a two-year deal, reportedly worth $23 million, to pitch
for the Giants, joining a stellar rotation that includes Madison Bumgarner,
Matt Cain and Tim Lincecum. The 38-year-old right-hander compiled an 8-7
record with a 3.97 ERA last season for the Braves, before sustaining a
season-ending ankle injury.

2014
The Mets announce the team is moving in sections of the Citi Field outfield
wall, adjusting the distances from home plate to center and right field from
three to 11 feet. According to New York's General Manager Sandy Alderson,
the modifications are a refinement of previous changes made at the ballpark
and will continue to be fair to both pitchers and hitters.

Three-time All-Star backstop Russell Martin and the Blue Jays finalize
a five-year $82-million contract, the second-largest free-agent deal in
franchise history. The acquisition of the 31-year-old Canadian-born catcher,
who led the Pirates to playoff appearances for the past two seasons,
signals Toronto's intention of being a contender in the AL East next year.
