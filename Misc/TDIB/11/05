play in St. Louis as the Browns next season.

The Yankees trade 2B Jimmy Williams and OF Danny Hoffman to the Browns for
P Fred Glade, speedy 2B Harry Niles and OF Charlie Hemphill. Glade will
pitch just 5 games in 1908 before retiring.

the 7th, the Phils win, 5-3, to even the series.

1914
The ban on Sunday baseball is upheld in Washington, DC by the Court of

Bert Wilson, the radio voice of the Chicago Cubs on station WIND since 1943,
dies at the age of 44. The cause was high blood pressure.

1968
Denny McLain is the unanimous choice as AL MVP.

1969
The Reds send pitcher George Culver to the Cards for P Ray Washburn.

1976
For the second consecutive season, Jim Palmer (22-13, 2.51) is the recipient
of the American League Cy Young Award. The Orioles' right-hander garners
first-place votes on 19 of 24 ballots cast by BBWAA, with the remaining
five top spots going to rookie sensation Mark Fidyrch of the Tigers.

The A's release Chuck Tanner from his contract allowing him to manage
the Pirates in exchange for catcher Manny Sanguillen and $100,000 from

will compile a 711-685 (.509) record and will win a World Championship
in 1979.

New AL franchises in Seattle and Toronto fill up their rosters by selecting
30 players apiece from unprotected players on other AL rosters. OF Ruppert
Jones (Seattle) and IF-OF Bob Bailor (Toronto) are the first choices.

1991
Terry Pendleton of the Braves wins the NL MVP Award. The third baseman led
the NL in batting average and hits, tied for first in total bases and was
3rd in slugging. He'll be named Comeback Player of the Year - the first
player to raise his average 80 points and add 15 HRs - and win his 3rd Gold
Glove. Barry Bonds is runner-up; the 2 will switch places next year.

for the American League's Rookie of the Year. The 22-year-old shortstop is
the eighth Yankee freshman to be honored, the first since Dave Righetti
copped the award in 1981. Jeter was the Yanks Opening Day shortstop, the
first rookie to start at SS for New York since Tom Tresh in 1962.

1997
On the day he is named the AL Manager of the Year, Davey Johnson resigns
as Orioles skipper. Although the team had the best record in the American
League (98-64), the relationship between the Birds' skipper and owner Peter
Angelos continued to deteriorate during the season.

In what Bud Selig says is Phase 1 of a realignment of the major leagues,
his Milwaukee Brewers move from the AL to the NL.

1999
After 2 days of play in the 1999 Intercontinental Cup tourney in Sydney,
Australia, the USA has a 2-0 record. Yesterday, they won, 4-0, over Japan
by scoring 4 runs in the 9th, 3 on Dan Held's HR. Cuba beats Taiwan, 1-0,
to avenge a loss yesterday to Cuba. Australia beats Italy after winning
yesterday, 4-3, over the Netherlands behind Shayne Bennett of the Expos.

2001
The Tigers hire Dave Dombrowski as president and CEO to replace John McHale
Jr. Dombrowski, 45, had been president and GM of the Marlins.

2002
Arizona's Randy Johnson wins the NL Cy Young Award, his 5th overall and 4th
in a row. Johnson is the first NL player since the Mets' Dwight Gooden to win
the pitching triple crown, going 24-5 with a 2.37 ERA and 334 strikeouts. He
led the major leagues in strikeouts for the ninth time.

The Silver Slugger Award-winners are announced. Barry Bonds and Mike Piazza
win their 10th awards.

2003

his ML debut this past season, appearing in 37 games for the Reds. He was
in Arizona for the Arizona Fall League.

Atlanta OF Andruw Jones wins his 6th straight Gold Glove Award as the NL
awards are announced. St. Louis OF Jim Edmonds also wins for the 6th time.

Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols are named the Outstanding Player of the
Year in their respective leagues in a vote of ML players.

2004
Four days after hiring him, the Diamondbacks fire manager Wally Backman
for failing to inform them that he had been arrested twice over the past
couple of years. Bob Melvin is hired to take his place.

2007
In an effort to replace relievers Francisco Cordero (Reds) and Scott
Linebrink (White Sox) who were lost to free agency, the Brewers sign David
Riske. The 31-year-old right-handed hurler, who after a rocky start pitched
effectively for the Royals last season, agrees to a three-year contract to
play for Milwaukee.

The Pirates name former third base coach John Russell as their 38th manager
in franchise history. The Buc's new skipper, the 2006 International League
Manager of the Year, managed the Red Barons, the triple-A Phillies affiliate
located in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, for the past two seasons.

2008
Extending a major league record, Greg Maddux captures his 18th Gold Glove,
making it two more than former Baltimore third baseman Robinson and 26-year
big league veteran Jim Kaat. The 42-year-old Dodger right-hander, who is
considering retirement, has been selected 18 of the last 19 years as the
NL's slickest fielding pitcher with the only exception occurring in 2003 when
Mike Hampton got the nod from the managers and coaches for the Rawling award.

2009
The Marlins trade Jeremy Hermida to the Red Sox for a pair of southpaw
prospects, Hunter Jones and Jose Alvarez. The move of the underachieving
outfielder, a first-round draft choice in 2002, will allow Florida to cut
payroll while adding pitching.

Bobby Abreu (.293, 15, 103), a last-minute signing with the club last season,
agrees to a $19 million two-year deal to stay with the Angels rather than
to take a chance again on the free-agent market. The veteran outfielder
didn't find a team until just prior to spring training when Los Angeles
offered him a one-year contract guaranteeing $5 million.

2010
One of the approximately 60 rare T206 Honus Wagner baseball card, auctioned
off by the Baltimore-based School Sisters of Notre Dame, is acquired by
Sports card store owner Doug Walton, who pays $262,000 for the treasured
piece of memorabilia. The School Sisters of Notre Dame plan to use the
windfall from the sale of the valuable card of the Pirates third baseman
to benefit ministries for the poor in 35 countries.

2012
The Boston Red Sox and David Ortiz come to terms on a two-year $26 million
deal that will most likely keep the Dominican slugger in Boston for the
remainder of his career. Although limited to only 90 games last season due
to an injured Achilles heel, 'Big Papi' has averaged 34 homeruns and 109
RBIs each season during his ten-year tenure with the team.

2013
The Mariners name Lloyd McClendon to manage the team, replacing Eric Wedge,
who announced his retirement at the end of the season. Seattle's new
skipper, who spent the last eight seasons as a coach with Detroit, managed the
Pirates for five years, compiling a 336-446 record from 2001 through 2005.
