will not stand in the way of AL expansion to Seattle and Kansas City.

is the oldest person to win this award (since broken by Barry Bonds in
2004). The Pirates have thus won (or shared) all four "Most Valuable Player"
awards for the season (All-Star Game, National League Championship Series,
World Series, and National League regular season). This is the first such
sweep in Major League history (Stargell had won the awards for the NLCS,
World Series, and National League regular season, while teammate Dave Parker
won the All-Star Game award).

1984
Ryne Sandberg wins the NL MVP Award, becoming the first Cubs player to do
so since Ernie Banks in 1959. Sandberg hit .314 with 19 homeruns and 32
stolen bases, and led the NL in runs (114) and triples (19). He's a triple
and homer short of being the first with 200 hits, 20 HRs, 20 triples,

a former veep, testifies that he also heard her use racial slurs.

1995
Atlanta P Greg Maddux wins the NL Cy Young Award for an unprecedented
4th straight time. Maddux had a remarkable 19-2 record with a 1.63 ERA,
the 2nd year his ERA is below 1.80. Only he and Walter Johnson have done that.

The NL MVP Award goes to Reds SS Barry Larkin.

1996
Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti is the fourth unanimous winner of the
National League MVP. After the All-Star break, Caminiti led all NL players

Larry Walker is named National League MVP.

The Minnesota state legislature turns down the Twins' stadium proposal by
a vote of 84-47.

1998
The Babe hits new heights today:  $126,500. That is the price paid for the
ball he hit in 1923 for the first homerun in Yankee Stadium (off Howard
Ehmke). Mark Scala found the Ruth ball two years ago in the attic of his
grandmother's house. The bid was $110,000 and the total price includes the
auction house's 15 percent commission. Two years ago, the ball Eddie Murray
hit for his 500th homerun was sold for what one day could be $500,000. Michael
Lasky, the founder of the Psychic Friends Network, paid $280,000 that was
put in an annuity to be paid over 20 years. With interest, the annuity
will be worth about $500,000, according to a spokesman for Lasky, who
also operates as syndicated handicapper Mike Warren. The previous record
for an auctioned baseball was $93,500 for the ball that went through Bill
Buckner's legs in the 1986 World Series. That ball was bought by actor
Charlie Sheen in 1992. Other auctioned items include:  the bat Pete Rose
used for his 4,191st hit, which tied Ty Cobb's career record, was sold
by an unidentified Rose associate for $21,096; an autographed ball from
President Franklin Roosevelt that he used to throw out the ceremonial first
pitch before the 1941 season opener at Griffith Stadium sold for $17,255,
and a personal check signed Henry Louis Gehrig sold for $15,306.

2001
Randy Johnson (21-6, 2.49, 372) wins his fourth Cy Young Award, his third
straight as a member of the Diamondbacks. The 'Big Unit', who also won

consecutive Cy Young awards joining Greg Maddux who won four in a row
from 1992-95.

2002
The Giants select former Expo veteran skipper Felipe Alou to replace Dusty
Baker as their new manager. The 67-year-old Dominican Republic native

and was selected as the National League Manager of the Year in the 1994
strike-shortened season.

The Diamondbacks trade C Damian Miller to the Cubs for P David Noyce and
OF Gary Johnson.

The AL Gold Glove winners are announced. Three Mariners - Bret Boone,
John Olerud and Ichiro Suzuki - take awards.

Award. Gagne gets 28 of 32 first-place votes in outdistancing runner-up
Jason Schmidt of the Giants (Schmidt led the lead in won-loss percentage

in 1989 to win the award.

2006
Three of the top four National League vote-getters for Rookie of the Year
are Marlins. Florida shortstop Hanley Ramirez, in an extremely tight race,
edges Nationals third baseman Ryan Zimmerman, and teammates second baseman
Dan Uggla and hurler Josh Johnson.

The Mets stage a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the construction of the
45,000-seat ballpark which will replace Shea Stadium in 2009. The new $800
million ballpark, named CitiField in association with Citigroup Inc., will
be reminiscent of Ebbets Field and will feature a statue of Jackie Robinson
in a rotunda which will be named after the immortal Brooklyn Dodger infielder.

Tigers right-hander Jason Verlander (17-9, 3.63) cops the AL Rookie of the
Year award receiving 26 of a possible 28 first place votes cast by the
BBWAA. The 23-year-old hard-throwing hurler becomes the first starting
pitcher to win the freshman award since Yankee newcomer Dave Righetti
accomplished the feat 1981. Jonathan Papelbon is the runner-up.

2007
Given their post-season match-ups of the CYA candidates, many baseball
observers are surprised C.C. Sabathia (19-7, 3.21) is selected over Red
Sox ace Josh Beckett (20-7, 3.27) for the American League Cy Young Award
by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. In the ALCS,
the 27-year-old Indian southpaw faced Beckett twice and lost each time,
but voting is done at the end of the regular season.

2008
Cliff Lee (22-3, 2.54) receives 24 of 28 first-place votes from the BBWA

hurler to cop the honor.

With a year left on his contract, Ron Gardenhire agrees to a two-year
extension to remain as the Twins skipper until through 2001. The 51-year-old
manager, who replaced Tom Kelly in 2002, has compiled a 622-512 record
during his seven-year tenure in Minnesota winning four division titles with
the small market team.

In a five-player trade with the White Sox, the Yankees obtain Nick Swisher
and Triple-A right-hander Kaneoka Texeira in exchange for pitching prospects
Jeff Marquez and Jhonny Nunez, as well as infielder Wilson Betemit. The
Bronx Bombers plan to use the flexible 27-year-old flexible switch hitter
to replace departing first baseman Jason Giambi, but could be moved to the
outfield if the team acquires a big name free agent to play at first.

2010
During an auction at the Louisville Slugger Museum, the winning bid for the
ball Yankee slugger Babe Ruth hit for his 702nd career homerun is $264,500,
three times the estimated price. The historic horsehide, hit at Chicago's
Comiskey Park in 1934 off Ted Lyons, had been passed down by three generations
of a Minnesota family before being made available to the public.

The Marlins send outfielder Cameron Maybin to the Padres for Edward Mujica and
Ryan Webb, who are both right-handed relievers. The 23-year-old outfielder,
the 10th overall pick in 2005, was traded by Detroit two years later in
a major multiplayer Winter Meeting deal that included Miguel Cabrera and
Dontrelle Willis.

2012
Bob Melvin, for the second time in his career, is selected as the Manager of
the Year when the Baseball Writers' Association of America name him first
on 16 of 28 ballots to narrowly outpoint Buck Showalter of the Orioles,

recipient in 2007 with the Diamondbacks, guided the A's to the American
League West title before losing game 5 in the ALCS to Detroit.

Davey Johnson, who led the Nationals to the most victories in the major
leagues with a record of 98-64, is selected as the National League Manager
of the Year, easily outdistancing runners-up Dusty Baker of the Reds and
Bruce Bouchy of the Giants, when he receives 23 of the 32 first-place votes
cast by the writers. The 69-year-old field manager, honored by the BBWAA
in 1997 for his managerial efforts with the Orioles, joins Bobby Cox (Blue
Jays, Braves), Tony La Russa (White Sox, A's and Cardinals), Lou Piniella
(Mariners, Cubs) and Jim Leyland (Pirates, Tigers) as the fifth skipper to
have won the award in both leagues.

2013
The Phillies announce the team has reached a two-year $16-million deal with
Marlon Byrd, who helped the Pirates reach the postseason for the first
since 1992 by hitting .318 after being traded by the Mets to the Bucs at
the end of August. Last offseason, the 36-year-old outfielder signed a minor
league contract with New York, emerging as one of the team's few offensive
assets before being dealt to Pittsburgh along with John Buck for two minor
league prospects.

Max Scherzer is selected by the BBWAA as the American League's Cy Young
Award winner, receiving 28 of 30 writers' first place votes to finish
ahead of Ranger ace Yu Darvish and Mariner starter Hisashi Iwakuma. The
29-year-old Tigers right-hander, who posted a 21-3 record with a 2.90 ERA
in 32 starts for the pennant-winning club, joins Justin Verlander (2011),
Denny McLain (1968-69) and Willie Hernandez (1984) as the fourth hurler to
cop the prestigious pitching prize hurling for Detroit.

2014
Angels outfielder Mike Trout is the unanimous selection of the BBWAA for
the American League's Most Valuable Player Award, after finishing as the
writers' second choice during the previous two seasons to the Tigers'
Miguel Cabrera. The 23-year-old South Jersey native becomes the youngest
unanimous MVP selection in baseball history.
