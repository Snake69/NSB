Former St. Louis Browns manager George Stovall is the first ML player
to jump to the Federal League, signing to manage Kansas City. With glib
salesman Jim Gilmore as its president, and backed by several millionaires,

livelier baseball, the batter no longer needed the benefit of not being
charged a time at-bat when his fly ball advances a runner).

last-place Phillies wins.
