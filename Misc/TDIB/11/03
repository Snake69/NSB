1953
The rules committee restores the 1939 rule, which says a sacrifice fly
is not charged as a time at-bat. Also, the committee votes for "no gloves
on the field rule." Hank Greenberg, who proposed the change, says "Aside
from the possibility of hindering the play, gloves on the field look
sloppy." The committee also makes a rule that any runner will be called
out for deliberately running the bases backwards or even taking a lead off
the base in the wrong direction. A new balk rule is instituted which gives
the batter an option; if he gets a hit after a balk is called, he has the
option of accepting the outcome of the pitch, instead of being limited to
the advance of the runner(s). Rule suggestions rejected, as noted by Bob
Timmerman, include:  the legalization of the spitball, two bases for an
intentional walk, and the option of declining ball four.
