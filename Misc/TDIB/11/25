Nov 25

1904
Blame it on the long season. In a 6-4 loss to Los Angeles, Seattle SS Russ
Hall commits 2 errors, his 118th and 119th of the year, a PCL record for
most errors at any position.

1911
William Russell, head of the syndicate that owns the Boston Nationals,
dies. No doubt helping his demise was watching his team finish the season
with a winning percentage of .291. John Montgomery Ward, along with New
Yorkers James Gaffney and John Carroll, will purchase 945 of the 1000 shares
for $177,000. The team, known as the Rustlers after William Russell, will
start next season as the Braves.

1930
Giants first baseman Bill Terry (.401, 14, 117) is selected by the Sporting
News as the NL Most Valuable Player and Senator shortstop Joe Cronin (.346,
13, 126) receives the honor for the American League.

1941
Replacing Roger Peckinpaugh, who is moved up to the front office, Lou
Boudreau, with only three years of major league experience, is named as the
Indians' new manager. The 24-year-old shortstop is the youngest skipper
of this century, but is a year older than Scotland-born Jim McCormick, a
right-handed pitcher who managed the Cleveland Blues in 1879 at the age of 23.

1944
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's first commissioner, dies of a heart
attack at age 78 in Chicago. The Commissioner had ruled over baseball since
November 1920 in the wake of the Black Sox scandal, and wielded authority
perhaps unparalleled in any other industry. Landis had entered the hospital
on October 2nd. He will be named to the Hall of Fame on December 9th by a
special committee which he formed on August 4th.

1947
Sam Breadon sells the Cardinals empire to Postmaster General Robert Hannegan
and Fred Saigh. The price is in excess of $4 million with the new owners
getting the Cardinals players, physical assets, 16 minor league franchises,
$2.1 million in reserve funds and payment on a new ballpark site, 4 minor
league parks, and the lease on Sportsman's Park. Breadon had first acquired
an interest in the Cardinals in 1917 and bought control in 1920 for an
investment of $350,000.

1949
Ted Williams, who lost the Triple Crown when his batting average was .0002
below that of George Kell, wins the MVP vote in a landslide, 272 points
to 175. The favorite Phil Rizzuto, and Joe Page, finish 2nd and 3rd in the
voting. In several days, Ken Smith, the executive secretary of the BBWAA will
announce a change in policy, made at the request of Ford Frick, NL prexy. No
longer will the newspapers be given the results of the MVP voting a week
ahead of the announcement. Dan Daniels, writing in a front page article in
TSN, will accuse a number of sports writers of using the advance knowledge
to place bets. He says in NYC, nearly $500,000 was bet on the results, with
some bookies refusing to pay when they learned of the papers' early notice.

1952
The St. Louis Cardinals seek payment from the New York Giants for 2 televised
games in an effort to determine the TV and radio rights of visiting teams
for revenue.

1958
The BBWAA names Chicago Cubs slugger Ernie Banks the NL MVP. Willie Mays
is the runner-up.

1962
Boston trades AL batting champ Pete Runnels to Houston for OF Roman Mejias.

1966
Cincinnati INF Tommy Helms is voted NL Rookie of the Year.

1969
Kansas City OF Lou Piniella is voted AL Rookie of the Year.

The Reds trade Alex Johnson and Chico Ruiz to the California Angels for Ps
Pedro Borbon, Jim McGlothin and Vern Geishert. The talented but troubled
Johnson, who hit over .300 in his 2 seasons with the Reds, will win the AL
batting title in 1970. Borbon and McGlothin will be valuable additions to
the big Red Machine.

1970
Thurman Munson is named American League Rookie of the Year. The young Yankee
backstop receives twenty-three of the twenty-four first place ballot votes
cast with Indian outfielder Roy Foster being named on the other. Munson
batted .302 in 132 games.

1972
TSN announces the Gold Glove Award winners. Pirates OF Roberto Clemente wins
his 12th straight, and Dodgers 1B Wes Parker his 6th in a row. Neither will
play in 1973.

1974
Mike Hargrove of the Rangers takes AL Rookie of the Year honors.

1980
Gene Michael becomes the 25th Yankee manager replacing Dick Howser, who lead
New York to a first-place finish in the American League East compiling a
103-59 record. 'Stick' will guide the Bronx Bombers to the American pennant
during his first two seasons with the team.

1981
Brewer hurler Rollie Fingers becomes the first relief pitcher ever to win
the American League MVP Award. The 34-year-old right-hander, who also wins
the Cy Young award, narrowly beats former A's teammate Rickey Henderson in
the voting, 319-308.

1985
White Sox SS Ozzie Guillen, who hit .273 with just 12 errors in 150 games,
is named AL Rookie of the Year. Milwaukee lefty Ted Higuera finishes 2nd.

1986
Jose Canseco wins the American League's Rookie of the Year Award. The
Cuban-American is the first A's player to win the honor since Harry Byrd
accomplished the feat for Kansas City in 1952.

1991
The Expos trade 1B Andres Galarraga to the Cardinals in exchange for P
Ken Hill. Galarraga will struggle for St. Louis before enjoying a career
renaissance with the Colorado Rockies in 1993.

1996
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays sign high school pitcher Matt White for a record
$10.2 million bonus. The 6'5" White had a 0.65 ERA for Waynesboro (Pa) High
School last spring, and then was drafted 7th in June by the Giants. He
became a free agent in September on a technicality when San Francisco
failed to mail him a contract within 15 days of the draft. The deal tops
the $10 million signing last month of the number 2 pick, Travis Lee, by
the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The Mets obtain P Greg McMichael from the Braves in exchange for P Paul Byrd.

1998
The Angels sign free agent 1B Mo Vaughn to a 6-year contract, a year longer
than the Red Sox were willing to give Mo.

2002
The Red Sox hire the youngest general manager in major league
history. Twenty-eight-year-old Theo Epstein, a life-time Red Sox fan who
grew up about a mile from Fenway Park, becomes the team's 11th GM since
the club first established the position in 1933.

Detroit sends 1B Randall Simon to Pittsburgh for minor league P Adrian
Burnside and a pair of minor leaguers to be named.

2003
The Cubs trade first baseman Hee Seop Choi (.210, 10, 32) and a minor league
player to be named later to the World Champion Marlins in exchange for Gold
Glove first baseman Derrek Lee (.271, 31, 92).

2004
After spending $67 million to acquire its former president's shares of the
Mariners, the Nintendo's U.S. subsidiary now owns more than 50 percent of
the Northwest franchise. Due to the presence of Japanese superstar Ichiro
Suzuki, Seattle is one of the favorite U.S. major league teams in the Land
of the Rising Sun.

2005
The Phillies trade Jim Thome (.207, 7, 30) to the World Champion White Sox for
center fielder Aaron Rowland (.270, 13, 69) and a pair of southpaw pitching
prospects, Daniel Haigwood and Giovany Gonzalez. The 35-year-old injury-ridden
first baseman completed three seasons of his six-year $85 million deal with
Philadelphia helping the franchise to establish creditability when the team
moved to a new ballpark in 2004.

2006
The Diamondbacks acquire Ps Doug Davis and Dana Eveland and OF Dave Krynzel
from the Brewers in exchange for C Johnny Estrada and Ps Greg Aquino and
Claudio Vargas.

2008
Chase Utley is expected to need four to six months to recover from
arthroscopic hip surgery performed today at New York's Hospital for Special
Surgery. The All-Star Phillies second baseman, despite battling the injury
for much of the year, played a pivotal role in the team's World championship
this season.

The Marlins will endure a one-year delay in building their 37,000-seat,
retractable-roof stadium, now set to open in 2012. Club president David
Samson cites recent litigation slowed down the start of construction,
and now it would not be cost-effective to keep to the original timeline.

2009
Citing his age and the lack of stamina needed to do the job well, legendary
Yankee public address announcer Bob Sheppard indicates he will not be
returning to the Bronx to do any games. The 99-year-old 'Voice of Yankee
Stadium' spent more than 50 seasons behind the microphone introducing
lineups which have included Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Derek Jeter.
