The California Winter League holds Satchel Paige Day to honor the legend's
accomplishments in this multi-racial circuit. The right-hander takes
no prisoners throwing a three-hit 5-0 shutout with 14 strikeouts in the
Armistice Day contest, against Joe Pirrone's All-Stars, a team made up of
big leaguers who came to the west coast to play winter league ball to earn
some extra money.

1940

Marty Marion as the manager of the Baltimore Orioles.

1958
The American League announces the A's will play a league-record 52 night

is named AL MVP by a 234-157 margin over the Twins' Tony Oliva.

1981
Dodger hurler Fernando Valenzuela becomes the first rookie ever to win the
Cy Young Award. The 20-year-old southpaw from Mexico edges the Reds' Tom

Herb Score in 1955 to lead his league in strikeouts, with 180.

1982
The Orioles get their first new manager since 1968 as Joe Altobelli succeeds
the retiring Baltimore skipper, Earl Weaver. The former San Francisco
manager will compile in 212-167 (.559) record during his 2+ seasons with

a losing record.

1992

Harry Agganis Way, after the former Boston College and Red Sox star who
died during the 1955 season.

1996
The Mets trade Rico Brogna to the Phillies for relievers Toby Borland
and Ricardo Jordan. The first baseman, diagnosed with a form of spinal
arthritis in 1991, proves to be a good acquisition for Philadelphia when
the 27-year-old infielder spends 3+ seasons as an everyday player in the
City of Brotherly Love.

John Smoltz (24-8, 2.94) is named first on 26 of 28 BBWAA writers' ballots
to win the National League Cy Young Award outdistancing Florida's Kevin
Brown, who finishes second in the voting. The right-handed starter is
the fourth consecutive Atlanta pitcher to win the honor with teammate Tom
Glavine being the previous recipient of the prestigious pitching prize from
1993-1995. Since 1991, 5 of the 6 Cy Young winners have been Braves.

Owner Bud Selig meets with Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, in a
futile attempt to convince Fehr to accept the owners' demands. With the
deadline for an agreement at midnight on the 14th, there is virtually no
hope that the two sides will agree. If the two sides reach the deadline
without an agreement, the interleague schedule for next year will be wiped
out, and a traditional schedule followed.

Lum Harris, 81, dies. He was the manager who won the 1969 NL West title
with the Braves. He previously was a pitcher for the Athletics, and Houston
manager.

1997
Beginning to dismantle their World Champion team, the Marlins trade Moises

and a player to be named later. The outfielder had helped lead Florida to
the postseason batting .292 with 23 homeruns and 115 RBIs.

Mike Kelly becomes the first major leaguer obtained in a trade by the Rays

and P Alberto Castillo.

The Diamondbacks sign free agent P Greg Swindell to a 3-year contract,
and free agent 1B Greg Colbrunn to a 2-year contract.

The White Sox trade OF Mike Cameron to the Reds in exchange for 1B Paul
Konerko.

In a swap of high-priced unwanteds, the Mets send P Mel Rojas to the Dodgers
for OF Bobby Bonilla. Neither will help, but the little-used, outspoken
Bonilla, with a 2-year contract, will be a heavier burden than Rojas.

The Tigers sign free agent 3B Dean Palmer to a 5-year contract.

1999
Boston Red Sox skipper Jimy Williams is named the AL Manager of the Year.

The Blue Jays trade pitchers Pat Hentgen and Paul Spoljaric to the Cardinals
in exchange for P Lance Painter, C Alberto Castillo and OF Matt DeWitt.

2001
Cardinals 1B Mark McGwire announces his retirement, saying "I am unable
to perform at a level equal to the salary the organization would be paying
me." McGwire's 583 career HRs place him 5th on the all-time list.

2002
Barry Bonds becomes the first player in major league history to win the
Most Valuable Player Award five times. Bonds is the unanimous choice of the
baseball writers. The 38-year-old Giant left fielder, who also won the award
with the Pirates in 1990 and '92 and with San Francisco in 1993 and last
season, was the National League's batting champion with a .370 average and
broke Ted Williams' 1941 on-base percentage record with an amazing .582 OBP.

2003
Roy Halladay of the Blue Jays easily wins the American League Cy Young
Award, garnering 26 of 28 first-place votes. Chicago's Esteban Loaiza
finishes second in the voting. The 26-year-old right-hander finished the
season 22-7 with a 3.25 ERA, including winning 15 straight decisions from
May 1 to July 27. Halladay is the first pitcher since Mike Cuellar in 1974
to win 22 games in a season without posting a victory in April.

SF general manager Brian Sabean is named Executive of the Year by The
Sporting News.

The Astros sign free agent P Dan Miceli to a contract.

2004
Winning the American League top pitching honor with 28 first place votes,
Johan Santana (20-6, 265, 2.61) becomes the 18th unanimous Cy Young winner
selected by BBWAA. The 25-year-old Venezuelan southpaw joins Jim Perry
(1970) and Frank Viola (1988) as the only Twin hurlers to earn the award.

2006
Although the team has declined to comment, several newspapers and internet
sites report the Mets' new ballpark will be known as Citi Field. The deal
with CitiCorp, the nation's largest bank may be worth as much as $20 million
annually for 20 years, making it the richest naming rights agreement in
sports history exceeding the 32-year $300 million contract between the
NFL's Texans and Reliant Energy Inc.

2008
Joining Mike McCormick, who copped the honor in 1967, Tim Lincecum (18-5,
2.62) becomes the second San Francisco Giant hurler to win the NL Cy
Young Award. Finishing his first full big league season, the 24-year-old
right-hander receives 23 out of 32 first-place votes cast by the Baseball
Writers' Association of America to finish ahead of Arizona's Brandon Webb
and New York's Johan Santana.

The Nationals, which posted baseball's worst record last season, begin
revamping their team sending second baseman Emilio Bonifacio and two
minor leaguers to the Marlins in exchange for right-hander Scott Olsen and
outfielder Josh Willingham. The trade gives Washington much-needed starting
pitching and adds a left-fielder to an outfield corps which consists of
Lastings Milledge, Elijah Dukes and Austin Kearns.

2013
Rays outfielder Wil Myers, obtained in the off-season from the Royals along
with three other prospects in exchange for James Shields and Wade Davis,
wins the American League Rookie of the Year award. The 22-year-old North
Carolina native joins third baseman Evan Longoria (2008) and right-hander
Jeremy Hellickson (2011) as the third Tampa Bay player in the last six
years to cop the freshman honor.

The Dodgers confirm their manager Don Mattingly will return for his fourth
season with the team. The skipper's future in Los Angeles was uncertain early
in the season, but his job was saved when the club went on a record-setting
42-8 tear enroute to NL West division title.

Jose Fernandez (12-6, 2.19) receives 26 of 30 first-place votes from the
Baseball Writers' Association of America to easily win the National League's
Rookie of the Year award. The 21-year-old right-hander, who defected from
Cuba with his mother and sister in 2008, becomes the fourth Marlin player in
the last 11 years to cop the freshman honor, joining Chris Coghlan (2009),
Hanley Ramirez (2006) and Dontrelle Willis (2003).

The Twins announce Joe Mauer, who missed the last six weeks of the season,
will move from catcher to first base on a full-time basis next season. The
decision to change the 30-year-old All-star backstop's position was
prompted by the concussion he sustained when he took a foul tip off the
mask in mid-August.

2014
Buck Showalter, who led the Orioles to a divisional title for the first time
since 1997, is selected as the American League Manager of the Year by the
BBWAA. The Baltimore skipper cops the honor for the third time (1994 Yankees
and 2004 Rangers) in his career, joining Bobby Cox, Tony LaRussa, Dusty
Baker, Jim Leyland and Lou Piniella in winning the award three or more times.
