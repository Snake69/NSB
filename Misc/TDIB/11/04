Diamondbacks, the youngest franchise to win a Fall Classic, ends New York's
string of three consecutive World Championships. For the first time since
1985, two twenty-game winners start game 7 of the World Series as Yankee
pitcher Rogers Clemens (20-3) faces Randy Johnson (21-6) of the Diamondbacks
at Bank One Ballpark in Arizona. Sixteen years ago Bret Saberhagen (20-6)
of the Royals squared off against Cardinal hurler John Tudor (21-8) in the
Fall Classic finale at Kauffman Stadium. Alfonso Soriano breaks a 1-1 tie
with a HR in the 8th inning to give NY the lead, but Arizona comes back
with 2 runs in the bottom half of the 9th off Mariano Rivera to get the
win. Luis Gonzalez drives home the winning run while Randy Johnson gets
the win in relief. Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling are named co-MVPs of
the World Series. The Diamondback hurlers are the first multiple winners
since a trio of Dodgers (Ron Cey, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager) shared
the award in 1981.

2002
Eric Hinske (.279, 24, 84) wins American League Rookie of the Year. The
25-year-old Blue Jays third baseman receives 19 of 28 first-place votes

candidate to replace Joe Torre as manager in 2005.

Miami-Dade County Commissioners approve a plan committing $73 million in
tax money toward a new major league ballpark for the Marlins. The World
Champions, who have agreed to change their name to the Miami Marlins if

new park in 2007, but still doesn't have a plan for raising $137 million
needed as part of their commitment.

Seven repeat winners, including four Seattle Mariners, are named American
League Gold Glove Award winners. Yankee hurler Mike Mussina wins for the

Cleveland skipper compiled a 220-190 (.537) record and won a division during

long-time Yankee second baseman and third base coach becomes the first
black to manage in New York.

2005
The Yankees continue to makeover their coaching staff as southpaw Ron Guidry,
a former three-time 20-game winner is named to replaced Mel Stottlemeyer as
the team's pitching coach and former Red Sox skipper Joe Kerrigan joins the
team as its bullpen coach. Earlier in the week, former big league managers
Larry Bowa (third base coach), Lee Mazzilli (bench coach) and Tony Pena
(first base coach) also are added to Joe Torre's staff.

2008
Barack Obama, a long-time White Sox fan, is elected as the 44th president
of the United States. The junior senator from Illinois, the first
African-American to become the nation's commander-in-chief, is friendly
with the team's general manager Kenny Williams, also a prominent member of
Chicago's black community.

2009
In game 6 of the Fall Classic, the Yankees capture their 27th World
Championship, and first since 2000 with a 7-3 decison over the Phillies,
the defending champs. Hideki Matsui, New York's designated hitter, collects
six RBIs, tying a World Series mark, and Andy Pettitte becomes the second
pitcher to get the victory in all three post-season clinching games joining
Derek Lowe, who accomplished the feat with Boston in 2004.

Ryan Howard breaks KC outfielder Willie Wilson's record, established in
the 1980 Fall Classic against Philadelphia, for the most strike outs in
World Series history. The Phillies slugging first baseman, who was the NLCS
MVP against LA, earns the dubious distinction when he whiffs in the eighth
inning of game 6, making it the 13th time he returned to the bench without
putting the ball in play.

2010
Instead of negotiating a new multiyear contract with their designated hitter,
the Red Sox decide to exercise their $12.5 million option on 34-year-old
David Ortiz for the upcoming season. 'Big Popi', who would have preferred
a long-term contract, led Boston with 32 homers along with 102 RBIs.

2013
The Mets and Clear Channel Media and Entertainment announces the launch of
a five-year multimedia marketing partnership. WOR (710 AM) will become the

broadcasting Yankee games after carrying the Amazins' for the past 26 years.
