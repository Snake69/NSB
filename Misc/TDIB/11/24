third-place team this season. The Phillies' Willie Montanez receives the
remaining 6 first-place votes.

is to inform Jim Marshall he's fired as manager and Salty Saltwell, after
a year as GM, is named secretary and director of park operations. Herman

Cardinals reliever Todd Worrell, who led the NL with 36 saves, is named NL

In yet another unwise trade of prospects for aging veterans, the Yankees
deal Ps Brian Fisher, Doug Drabek and Logan Easley to the Pirates for Ps

2002
The Phillies, in an effort to fill the void created when Scott Rolen was
traded to the Cardinals last July, sign third baseman David Bell to a
four-year $17 million free agent deal. The 30-year-old infielder, who's
father (Buddy) and grandfather (Gus) were also major leaguers, played for

Mariners during the spring.

consecutive winning seasons in the City of Angels.

2-year contracts.

major trade this week sending last season's premiere free agent Carlos Delgado
(.301, 33, 115) and $7 million to the Mets for Mike Jacobs (10 homers in 100
at-bats), minor league infielder Grant Psomas and Yusmeiro Petit, a highly
touted pitching prospect. The Marlins also complete the trade with the Red
Sox which sends 2003 World Series MVP hurler Josh Beckett, third baseman
gold glove third baseman Mike Lowell, and set-up man Guillermo Mota to
Beantown on Thanksgiving night. This deal, in which the Fish receive four
minor leaguers (blue chip SS Hanley Ramirez and pitching prospects Anibal
Sanchez, Jesus Delgado and Harvey Garcia), and the Delgado trade with the
Mets will save the club $27 million dollars next season.

2006
Carlos Lee, who turned down a four-year $48 million offer from the Brewers,
signs the richest contract in franchise history agreeing to a six-year deal
with the Astros worth $100 million. El Caballo, who split last season playing
left field and DHing for the Brewers and Rangers, becomes the second player
this off-season and the 12th overall in baseball history to sign a contract
which reaches one-tenth of a billion dollars. The Astros also sign free
agent P Woody Williams to a 2-year deal.

2007
New Mexico governor Bill Richardson admits that the part of his bio which
reports he had been picked by the Kansas City A's in the 1966 amateur
baseball draft is untrue. The claim of the potential presidential candidate,
who pitched in college for Tufts University, is debunked by an Albuquerque
Journal investigation which found no evidence of the Guv ever being selected
by any major league team.

2008
As a result of being among the top finishers in an Indian reality TV
show called the "Million Dollar Arm", which drew approximately 30,000
contestants, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel sign free-agent deals to pitch
for the Pirates. The two 20-year-old cricket players, who never had thrown
a baseball until earlier this year, are the first two players from India
to sign contracts with a major league organization.

2009
Albert Pujols (.327. 47, 135), the unanimous choice of the writers,
wins his third National League MVP award, copping the honor for the
second consecutive year. The Cardinals first baseman joins Stan Musial,
Roy Campanella and Mike Schmidt, and Barry Bonds (who won the award seven
times) as the fifth player to be selected three times in the the Senior
Circuit for the prestigious prize.

2010
The commissioner's office announces the Edgar Martinez Outstanding Designated
Hitter Award has been given to Vladimir Guerrero. The Rangers' DH, who hit
.306, with 25 homers, along with 106 RBIs for the American League Champions,
beat out Boston's David Oritz and Minnesota's Jim Thome for the honor.

After designating him for assignment last week, the Pirates trade left-hander
Zach Duke to the Diamondbacks for a player to be named later (right-hander
Cesar Valdez). The 27-year-old southpaw, who burst onto the scene with an
8-2 record along with a 1.81 ERA, has compiled a 37-68 record since his
impressive debut with the Bucs in 2005.
