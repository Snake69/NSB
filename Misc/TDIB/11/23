to Joe Cronin, American League prexy, declaring his disappointment with
Cronin's wire of November 20. "You must know of course that, almost alone,
the American League's widely publicized position on alleged expansion has
forestalled completion of the Continental League. I have so stated repeatedly
and publicly for the past several weeks. However, I must admit that the
Commissioner's completely negative attitude toward a third Major League
has made an effective contribution to our forced delay and his continuous
statement of preference for internal expansion hurts even more."

1962
The BBWAA selects Dodger shortstop Maury Wills as the National League's
Most Valuable Player. The Gold Glove infielder stole a record 104 bases

play off against San Francisco.

and dies unexpectedly. The 6'4" 250-pound Blue Jays southpaw reliever, who
signed with the club in September after being released by the Diamondbacks,
also played for the As, Rockies and Devil Rays during his seven-year career.

The woeful Reds bullpen gets a big boost with the signing of free-agent

former Brewers closer collected 44 saves in 51 chances while posting a 2.98
ERA with Milwaukee last season.

League Most Valuable Player joining Zoilo Versalles (1965), Harmon Killebrew
(1969), Rod Carew (1977) and Justin Morneau (2006). The slugging Gold Glove

driving in 100 runs despite missing 29 games in September after suffering
two broken ribs.

Aubrey Huff agrees to a $22 million two-year deal to stay with the World
Champion Giants. Last January, San Francisco signed the 33-year-old to a
one-year contract with the hope he could provide some pop in the middle
of the batting order, and the first baseman/outfielder did not disappoint
hitting a team-leading 26 homeruns along with 86 RBIs.

2011
The oft-injured Grady Sizemore agrees to a one-year incentive-laden contract
to stay with the Indians, after the club declined his $9 million option
for 2012. The Tribe will pay the 29-year-old All-Star outfielder $5 million
next season along with the opportunity for him to make another $4 million
based on plate appearances and another $500,000 if he is selected comeback
player of the year.
