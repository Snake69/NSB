1922

hitting .303 when forced to quit.

1941
Joe DiMaggio is named AL MVP. His 56-game hitting streak edges out Ted
Williams and his .406 batting average for the award (291 votes for DiMaggio
and 254 for Williams). The NL winner is Dolf Camilli with Dodgers teammates
Pete Reiser and Whit Wyatt finishing 2nd and 3rd.

1947
Setting off a storm of controversy, Joe DiMaggio is named American League
MVP by a single point over Ted Williams. Williams, the Triple Crown
winner, receives 201 points, but is completely left off the ballot of one
sportswriter. Williams, in his 1959 autobiography, accuses Mel Webb of being
the villain:  the Boston writer and Williams had feuded over the years. But
another Boston writer, Harold Kaese, says that the 71-year-old Webb did not
have a vote in 1947, and the culprit was a disgruntled midwest writer. A
10th-place vote would have given Williams the needed 2 points. DiMaggio
receives 8 first-place votes, Williams 3, Lou Boudreau, 1, Joe Page 7,
George McQuinn 3 and Eddie Joost, who hit .206 with 110 strikeouts, receives
2. Williams is selected as The Sporting News Player of the Year.

1956
After winning the MVP last week and the Rookie of the Year in 1949, Brooklyn
starter Don Newcombe (27-7, 3.06) receives major league baseball's inaugural
Cy Young Award, an honor that will be given to just one hurler until 1967
when each league will name a winner of the prestigious pitching prize. The
Dodgers director of Community Affairs remains the only player in baseball
history to have won all three major post-season awards

Enroute to play winter ball for Valencia, Charlie Peete, his wife,
and three small children are among the 25 victims who perish when their
Caracas-bound plane crashes into the side of a Venezuelan moutain during
a severe thunderstorm. The 27-year-old outfielder, who won the American

winner for Chicago in his sophomore season.

The A's and Orioles swap first basemen with Jim Gentile along with $25,000
