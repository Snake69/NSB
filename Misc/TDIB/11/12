1908
In Havana, the Cincinnati Reds beat a local club, 3-1. The Reds are the first
ML team to play in Cuba. The game is the first of 12 the team will play during
their month-long stay in Cuba. The Reds will finish 6-5 against the Cubans,
and lose a game to the Brooklyn Royal Giants, a Negro team touring the island.

1920
With Ban Johnson barred from the meeting, the 16 ML clubs settle their
differences. The 12-team-league idea is discarded, and the 2 leagues will
continue with their same identities. The owners unanimously elect Kenesaw
Mountain Landis chairman for 7 years. Judge Landis accepts, but only as
sole commissioner with final authority over the players and owners, while
remaining a federal judge (with his $7,500 federal salary deducted from the
baseball salary of $50,000). The agreement will be signed on January 12,
1921, when he is to begin his duties.

1923
John McGraw sends OF Casey Stengel, SS Dave Bancroft and OF Bill Cunningham to
the Braves for P Joe Oeschger and OF Billy Southworth. Bancroft will be named
player-manager, one of three players in the swap who will skipper the Braves.

1936
Following the death of Phil deCateesby Ball, wealthy owner of the St. Louis
Browns, his estate sells the team to a syndicate headed by Donald L. Barnes
and Bill DeWitt. As the new owners of Sportsman's Park, they announce
their intention to install lights and bring night baseball to the AL,
an idea endorsed by the Cardinals as well.

1939
The youngest of the 3 DiMaggio brothers, Dom, is bought for $40,000 by the
Boston Red Sox from San Francisco (PCL).

P Victor Starfin wins his 42nd game in a 96-game season, leading the
Yomiuri Giants to the pennant, and setting a post-1900 world record for
season victories that will be equaled (by Kazuhisa Inao in 1961) but never
broken. Starfin, the 6'4" son of Russian immigrants, was exempt from the
military call-up of able-bodied Japanese. From 1936-55 he won 303 games,
the first in Japanese baseball to top the 300 mark. Except for Oh, he is
the only non-Japanese player in the Japanese baseball Hall of Fame.

1940
Unwilling to yield to the players' demands during the season, Alva Bradley
finally fires Indian manager Oscar Vitt and replaces him with Roger
Peckinpaugh. It is Peckinpaugh's second time as Cleveland's field boss.

1952
The baseball writers name Philadelphia P Bobby Shantz as the AL MVP. He
was 24-7 (with a 2.48 ERA) for the 79-75 A's. The 27-year-old southpaw,
who is named first on 16 of the 20 writers' ballots, easily outdistances
runner-ups Allie Reynolds and Mickey Mantle.

The White Sox place OF Jim Rivera on a one-year probation after he is
cleared of a rape charge.

1955

departure of 'the Hat', the National League for first time in its history
will not have a player-manager in the circuit.

1957
Frank Lane resigns as GM of the Cardinals, who replace him with Bing Devine.

1958
Yankees right-hander Bob Turley, the World Series Most Valuable Player,

one vote. 'Bullet Bob' posted a 2.97 ERA while compiling a 21-7 record and
won another two games for New York in the Fall Classic.

American League pitcher to unanimously win the Cy Young Award. Denny McLain
was the first to accomplish the feat in 1968.

Arbitrator George Nicolau overturns the suspension of Yankees P Steve Howe
for being too severe. The pitcher is resigned by the Yankees.

1996
Blue Jays right-hander Pat Hentgen (20-10) edges New York's Andy Pettitte
(20-8) for the American League Cy Young Award by the narrow margin of
110-104. Mariano Rivera, the Yankee southpaw's teammate, finishes third in
the ballot, getting one first-place vote.

1997

The Athletics sign free agent INF Dave Magadan.

1998
The Orioles sign free agent P Mike Timlin to a 4-year contract.

1999
In the 1999 Intercontinental Cup tourney in Sydney, Australia, Cuban
righthander Ciro Licea shuts out Team USA, 7-0, striking out 13. Team USA
will play for the bronze medal against either Australia or Japan while Cuba,
with its second win against the Americans in the tournament, will play the
winner of that game for the gold medal.

2001
One year after playing Class-A ball, Albert Pujols (.329, 37, 130) is the
unanimous choice for National League Rookie of the Year by the BBWAA. The
Cardinal freshman set NL rookie marks for RBIs (130), total bases (360)
and extra-base hits (88) and falls one homerun shy of tying the National
League rookie record of 38 established by Frank Robinson in 1956 as a member
of the Reds.

Although disappointed not winning the award unanimously, Mariners outfielder
Ichiro, who led the circuit in hitting, is named the American League
Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Chris
Assenheimer of the Elyria (Ohio) Chronicle-Telegram voted for C.C. Sabathia
(17-4) as his top choice citing the nine years of professional experience
in Japan made Ichiro less of a rookie than the 21-year-old Indian hurler.

2002
Miguel Tejada, who receives 356 points from the Baseball Writers' Association,
including 21 first-place votes of the 28 cast, is selected as the American
League's Most Valuable Player. The A's shortstop joins countrymen Sammy
Sosa and George Bell as Dominican Republic natives to win the award. Texas'
Alex Rodriguez finishes second in the voting.

2003
Tony Pena of the Royals and Jack McKeon of the Marlins are named Manager
of the Year in the AL and NL, respectively.

2006
The Yankees trade P Jaret Wright to the Orioles in exchange for P Chris
Britton.

2007
In the closest election since the current method was initiated in 1980 -
5 points for 1st; 3 points for second; 1 point for third - the Baseball
Writers Association of America select Ryan Braun as the National League
Rookie of the Year. By a margin of just two points, the Brewers' third
baseman edges Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who was listed first on
more than half of the BWAA ballots.

Dustin Pedroia (.317, 8, 50) becomes the sixth Red Sox player and the first
to win the American League Rookie of the Year since Nomar Garciaparra was
selected in 1997. The 5'9" second baseman, who is listed first on 24 of the
28 BBWAA ballots, easily outdistances Rays outfielder Delmon Young (.288,
13, 93).

2008
Receiving 27 of the 28 first-place votes cast by the Baseball Writers'
Association of America, Joe Maddon easily wins the American League Manager
of the Year award. The Rays skipper, who succeeded Lou Piniella in 2006,
this year's NL's choice for the honor, led Tampa Bay to a pennant after
the team posted the worst record (66-96) in baseball last season.

Lou Piniella wins the National League Manager of the Year award after leading
the Cubs to the postseason for the second consecutive season. The fiery
skipper also won the AL honor in 1995 and 2001 while managing in Seattle.

The A's acquire Matt Holliday (.321, 25, 88) from the Rockies in exchange
for former Rookie-of-the Year reliever Huston Street, southpaw starter Greg
Smith and highly touted outfield prospect Carlos Gonzalez. The 28-year-old
All-Star left fielder, who can become a free-agent at the end of the season,
was unable to come to terms with Colorado on a long term contract.

2012
Mike Trout (.326, 30, 83), the BBWAA's unanimous selection as the Rookie of
the Year, surpasses Lou Whitaker (1978, Tigers) by three months and five
days to become the youngest American League player to be honored with the
award. The 21-year-old Angel center fielder joins Evan Longoria (2008, Rays),
Nomar Garciaparra (1997, Red Sox), Derek Jeter (1996, Yankees), Tim Salmon
(1993, Angels), Sandy Alomar Jr (1990, Indians), Mark McGwire (1987, A's)
and Carlton Fisk (1972, Red Sox) as the only other unanimous AL winners.

Bryce Harper becomes the second youngest player to be selected as the
National League Rookie of the Year, being 24 days older than Doc Gooden
when the Mets right-hander won the award in 1984. The 20-year-old center
fielder is the first Nationals player to win a BBWAA postseason award since
the franchise moved from Montreal to Washington in 2005.

2013
Clint Hurdle becomes the second Buc skipper, joining Jim Leyland (1990,
â€™92), to be selected as the National League Manager of the Year by the
BBWAA, after guiding the 94-68 Pirates to the Wild Card and their first
winning season since 1992. The Pittsburgh pilot was named first on 25 of
30 writers' ballots, easily out-distancing runner-ups Don Mattingly of the
Dodgers and the Braves' Fredi Gonzalez for the award.

Terry Francona, who never received a first-place vote for the award after
guiding Boston to two World Championships in his eight seasons with the club,
is named the American League's Manager of the Year by the BBWAA. The Indian
skipper, who helped the much-improved Wild Card Tribe reach the playoffs for
the first time in six years, receives 15 of the 30 writers' first-place
votes, with John Farrell of the Red Sox finishing second, having his name
on the top of a dozen ballots.
