as the only state with no Sunday baseball in the major leagues.

1930

Braves, who are making aggressive moves under Lou Perini and other new
owners. Eddie Dyer will become the new Cardinal pilot.

1950
Branch Rickey signs a five-year deal with the Pirates to be the club's

seem to work as the Bucs will compile a 269-501 record (.349) during his
tenure in Pittsburgh.

monopoly. He cites the Dodgers' deficit in 1950.

only relief pitchers to be named MVP and Cy Young Award winner in the same
season. Kent Hrbek is 2nd with Dan Quisenberry third. Boston's Tony Armas

in those categories and not win was Ted Williams.

1987
The Reds trade right-handed pitcher Ted Power and shortstop Kurt Stillwell
to the Royals for shortstop Angel Salazar and left-hander Danny Jackson. The

players' union.

Todd Hollandsworth is voted the 1996 NL Rookie of the year, the 5th year
in a row that the award has gone to a Dodger. The previous 4 were Karros,
Piazza, Mondesi and Nomo. Hollandsworth played 41 games in 1995 (103 at-bats)
but a broken right hand in May and a broken right thumb in August of '95
kept him eligible for the rookie award.

1997
For a second time, the Baseball Writers' Association of America name Dusty

1998
The Dodgers sign free agent OF Devon White to a 3-year contract.

2000
Mariner closer Kazuhiro Sasaki (2-5, 3.16, 37 saves) becomes the second-oldest
major leaguer to win rookie of the year honors when the 32-year-old captures
the American League honor. Boston Braves rookie Sam Jethroe (who played in
the Negro Leagues before MLB) was 33 days older than the Japanese reliever
when he won the National League award in 1950.

2001
Denying it's a negotiating ploy, major league owners give commissioner
Bud Selig the authority to "begin the process" of eliminating two 'to
be announced' teams by a 28-2 vote. Donald Fehr, the Players Association
executive director, calls the action of possibly eliminating the Expos, Twins
or Marlins most imprudent and unfortunate, and the worst manner in which
to begin the process of negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement.

Gold Glove award winners are announced. Ivan Rodriguez wins his 10th straight
to tie Johnny Bench for the most by a catcher, Greg Maddux wins his 12th
straight to extend his NL record for pitchers, and Roberto Alomar wins for
the 10th time, the most ever for a 2B.

2002
Citing Dusty Baker's reluctance to stay with the organization, an unhappy
general manager Brian Sabean announces the Giant skipper of the last ten
years will not be back to manage in San Francisco next season. The National
League pennant-winning skipper has supposedly expressed an interest in the
Cubs and Mariners.

Randy Johnson wins his fifth Cy Young Award, the fourth consecutive with the
Diamondbacks. The 39-year-old southpaw, with 24 victories, 334 strikeouts

in 1985 to win the pitching equivalent of the triple crown.

Oakland's 24-year-old Barry Zito wins the AL Cy Young Award.

2004
At an auction in Louisville, a Louisville Slugger bat signed by "Shoeless"
Joe Jackson sells for $137,500. Cracked on the handle and worn on the
barrel, the bat, made in 1910 or 1911, has Jackson's signature along the
hitting area in bold ink. The bat is the featured piece among 412 items
sold. The Louisville Slugger Museum planned to use the funds raised by the
auction to pursue other pieces of baseball memorabilia. Also, a bat used
by Ty Cobb goes for $132,000, a record for a Cobb bat. The bat's value was
enhanced by grease-penciled writing on the barrel. The markings were made by
a Hillerich & Bradsby receiving agent working at the factory during Cobb's
era. They indicate that Cobb probably used the bat, then had it sent back
to Louisville to have more made exactly like it. A Cleveland Indians jersey
worn by Satchel Paige sells for $110,000. A letter handwritten by Babe Ruth,
with six of his signatures at the bottom, and its original envelope went
for $41,800. A baseball signed by Ruth and Lou Gehrig went for $31,900.

2006
After refusing to remove his Dodgers hat at a City Council meeting,
Charles Littleton is TASERed with 50,000 volts by Saginaw (MI) police. The

to gain extra credit for a sociology class, became unruly, according to
police, upon being asked to take off his baseball cap.

The Texas Rangers hire Oakland Athletics' coach Ron Washington as their
new manager.

2007
At their annual meeting, baseball's general managers vote 25-5 in favor of
using instant replays on a limited basis. The proposal, which owners, players
and umpires will need to approve to make the use of video a reality, would
be utilized only in determining homerun calls in doubt due to possible fan
interference, balls clearing the fence, and balls near or over the foul pole.

Curt Schilling agrees to terms to stay with the World Champion Red Sox. The
$8 million one-year deal includes an additional $5 million in bonuses,
$3 million based on innings pitched and another $2 million based on the
right-hander's weight.

Breaking a tie with former Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson and veteran
hurler Jim Kaat for the most in a career, Greg Maddux wins his 17th Gold
Glove, an award given for fielding excellence choosen by the managers and
coaches in each league. The 41-year-old future Hall of Famer, now with the
Padres, has been selected every year as the top fielding pitcher in the
National League since 1990 with the exception of 2003 when Mike Hampton of
the Braves won the honor.

2009
The Diamondbacks exercise their $8.5 million option on the 2006 Cy Young Award
winner, Brandon Webb. The 30-year-old right-handed starter, who underwent
shoulder surgery in August, was shut down after pitching just four innings on
Opening Day and did not take the mound again for the duration of the season.

2014
The Dodger announce their new general will be Zaidi Farhan, the former
Director of Baseball Operations and assistant GM of the A's. The MIT graduate,
the first Muslim to hold the position for any American professional sports
franchise, joins the team's overhauled front office, which also includes
the recent hired Andrew Friedman as the president of baseball operations
and Josh Byrnes as the senior vice president for baseball operations.
