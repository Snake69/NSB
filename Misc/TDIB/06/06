1903
In a rain-shortened 6-inning game, the Pirates keep their whitewash streak
alive at 5 games as Deacon Phillippe shuts out the 6th-place Beaneaters,
4-0. The game ends after Honus Wagner leads off with a triple in the 7th
inning, a hit that stays in the record books according to the rules.

In Boston, the Americans score ten runs for the 3rd day in a row, beating
Chicago, 10-2. The scoring is helped by special ground rules instituted
because of the overflow crowd of 10,000.

1904
New York scores 6 runs in 3 innings against Pirates P Roscoe Miller
and coasts to an 11-0 win. The Giants are led by Browne, with 4 hits,
Gilbert, with a homer and 3 hits, and Roger Bresnahan, with two homers,
both inside-the-park. With the game safely in hand, Mathewson departs
after 5 innings. Miller will be 7-8 with the Pirates before incurring
a severe injury in a carriage accident on the way to the ball park in
Philadelphia. The injury ends his career.

1905
In a courtesy trade, the Reds send little-used (2 at-bats) C Gabby Street

traded by the Reds for Chick Fraser, retires all three Giant batters he
faces, but is hit on his pitching hand by a line drive off the bat of the 3rd
hitter, Dan McGann. Harper is lifted for pinch hitter Johnny Kling in the 2nd
inning and never pitches again. Harper also pitched for the losingest team,
the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. The Cubs, on their way to a record 116 wins,
top the host Giants 11-3 scoring 7 in the 8th, with Schulte collecting 5
hits. Orval Overall is the winner.

The White Sox buy the contract of Patsy Dougherty from the
Highlanders. Dougherty has been playing independent ball but will sign with
the Sox.

1908
The Athletics hold first place for the last time this year. Tomorrow,
the Cleveland Naps will replace them, and the next day the White Sox will
take the lead for the first time. They jump from 7th to first in 4 days,
as a 13-game winning streak puts them into the race, despite being just
three games over .500.

At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson beats the Cardinals, 3-2, for his 20th straight
win over St. Louis stretching back to June 16, 1904. Art Fromme takes the
loss. Matty allows 4 hits and strikes out 8, including Joe Delahanty 3
times. He also walks two in a row, an unusual occurrence.

1910
Boston OF Duffy Lewis has the only hit - a single - against White Sox ace
big Ed Walsh as Chicago wins, 1-0.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants cut the Cards, 6-1, as Mathewson is victorious

with Washington ahead, 2-1, and holds Chicago scoreless the rest of the
way. Washington tallies another 7 runs for the 9-1 win, awarded to Johnson
under the practices at the time.

1913
The Yankees lose their thirteenth game without a victory when the team is
defeated by the Indians at the Polo Grounds, 2-1. The 9-34 club's futility,
which sets a franchise record, includes a 3-3 tie to Boston during the
14-game span. The Yankees will finish this season in 7th place.

1914
Christy Mathewson allows 10 Cardinal hits, including 4th inning homers
by Chief Wilson and Ivy Wingo, but hangs on to win, 6-4. Slim Sallee is
the loser.

with the team to play 1B. Wagner sends a telegram stating: "Finding the call
of baseball too strong to resist I desire to continue to play the game I
love and to which I owe all I posses, and I hereby petition the National
Commission to grant my request for reinstatement so that I may play with
my old club tomorrow."

who goes 5 for 5, and Ray Bates, who is 4 for 5 with a HR.

Pete Alexander shuts out the Cubs for the first-place Phillies, winning
4-0 and hitting a pair of triples. The Phillies (24-14), Giants (23-14)
and Cubs (28-18) are bunched at the top of the NL.

1918
In Brooklyn, the ever-popular Casey Stengel, now a Pirate after being
traded by Brooklyn in January, is good-naturedly applauded when he comes
to bat in the 7th inning. He calls time, doffs his cap in response, and
to everyone's delight releases an "irate but much relieved" sparrow he had
hidden there. Brooklyn wins, 1-0, when Hy Myers scores from 3rd on double
steal. This famous anecdote has been reported in some books as having
occurred on May 25, 1919.

The Red Sox top the Indians, 2-0, in 10 innings, with the Babe in LF going
hitless ending his streak of 4 homers in 4 games. Jones is the CG winner
over reliever Jim Bagby.

1920
The Cardinals play their last game at decrepit Robison Field (renamed
Cardinal Field in 1917), their home field since 1893, beating the Cubs,
5-2. It is the last major league game played in a 19th Century wooden
ballpark. Sam Breadon's first decisions as the team's new owner is to
agree to a ten-year lease for $20,000 annually allowing his team to move
six blocks and share Sportman's Park with the Browns, and then using the
money from selling the aging ballpark to finance Branch Rickey's idea of
establishing a farm system by investing in a club afflilation with a minor
league team in Houston, Texas. For the next 32 years, St. Louis will be
the only two-franchise city with one ball park.

Carl Mays allows 6 runs - 3 unearned - but the Yankee submariner earns
his 7th straight win over the Athletics, 12-6. Babe Ruth is 3 for 3 with

become the sixth major leaguer to collect 3,000 hits. The 38-year-old White
Sox infielder strokes the historic two-bagger off Washington's Walter Johnson,
also a future inductee in Cooperstown.

Fred Clarke and Honus Wagner are in the lineup of a 1901 Pirates team that
plays a brief game as part of Golden Jubilee Day in Pittsburgh. A week
later Clarke will join the Pirates as assistant to the president, a move
that will lead to a player revolt in which heads roll and pennants are lost.

1926
Player-manager Tris Speaker, 38, of the Indians, sporting a lifetime .350 BA,
startles players and fans alike when he directs P George Uhle to pinch-hit
for him in a close contest with the Yankees. Uhle is a good-hitting hurler,
but he flies out. The Yankees win, 6-5.

After the New York Sun criticizes the Robins because top pitcher Jesse
Petty is not one of their highest paid players, manager Wilbert Robinson
phones the paper's editor to complain. From this date on, the Sun reacts by
referring to the team as the Dodgers, rather than the affectionate eponym
'Robins' that had often been used.

1928
Cy Williams hits his 2nd pinch HR in 2 games but the Phils lose to the Cubs,

but K 189 in 140 innings to earn a call-up to Detroit in August.

1931
At Yankee Stadium, the Indians take a 7-4 lead into the 9th when Morgan
and Vosmik single against Jim Weaver. Willie Kamm lines to Lou Gehrig who
starts a 3-6 triple play. The Tribe still wins, 7-5.

1933
The Cards and Reds battle to a 6-2 St. Louis decision, with Dizzy Dean beating
Paul Derringer. The pre-game fight between the two pitchers, who exchanged
words then fists during batting practice, goes to the Reds pitcher, who
landed the first blow. Reds manager Jewel Ens was tossed during the game,
and several bottles were tossed as well. One bottle strikes Burgess Whitehead
on the shoulder. Pepper Martin, the NL's top hitter at .386, has four hits,
as does Ducky Medwick.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1934

but loses, 2-1. Charlie Gehringer's RBI single is the only hit. Weiland
does stop Goose Goslin's hit streak at 30 games. The victory by Schoolboy
Rowe puts the Tigers in 1st place.

as rain stops the match after 7 innings. The Cards lead is reduced to 2 games.

1937
Umpire Bill Klem declares the Cardinals winners of the 2nd game with the
Phils when the Phils stall and delay until a Sunday curfew of 7 P.M. is
reached. The first game was delayed 1 1/2 hours because of rain, and the
nitecap doesn't start until after 5:30. The Phils trail 8-2 with 2 outs
in the 5th inning when the game is forfeited. Joe Medwick loses a homer in
the nitecap and will end the season tied with Mel Ott for the HR lead.

takes place when Woody English of the Dodgers wins a suit by hitting a double
off the sign of clothier Abe Stark at the base of the Ebbets Field scoreboard.

1938
The Reds get Wally Berger from the Giants for Alex Kampouris.

1939
Carl Stolz' dream of providing a wholesome baseball experience for local
boys as a means of teaching the concepts of sportsmanship, fair play and
teamwork becomes a reality when the first Little League game is played with
Lundy Lumber defeating Lycoming Dairy in Williamsport, PA, 23-8. Allen
"Sonny" Yearick, a participant in the inaugural game, will be the first
graduate of the fledgling youth league to play professional ball, becoming
a farmhand in the Boston Braves organization in 1948.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants unload on the first-place Reds with
five HRs after two are out in the 4th inning, a ML record. Entering the
inning, the Giants sport a 6-0 lead, thanks in part to homers by Jo Jo
Moore and Met Ott. After two are out, Harry Danning homers off Peaches
Davis. Then Ott singles, Zeke Bonura walks and Frank Demaree lifts a 3-run
homer. Former batting practice hurler Wesley Livingood relieves and walks
Tony Lazzeri. Burgess Meredith acts like a slugger, belting one of his two
homers of the year, and pitcher Manny Salvo follows with his only career
homer, an inside-the-parker. Up for a 2nd time in the inning, Jo Jo Moore
hits an upper deck blast for the 5th homer after 2 outs, an unsurpassed
mark. The Giants coast to a 17-3 win.

In Cleveland, three Red Sox players throw a baseball 122 feet a second
into a new photo-electric pitching meter (as noted by historian Dick
Thompson). Three Cleveland Indians can only do 119 feet. Pitchers are not
included in the test but 'unofficially,' Bob Feller of Cleveland fires
three balls into the meter from a distance of 20 feet. The best mark he
recorded was 119 feet. His less-touted teammate, pitcher Johnny Humphreys,
recorded 127 feet. There will be a contest for pitchers later. Jimmy Foxx,
Jim Tabor and Roger Cramer made it a clean sweep with a first-place tie in
the contest. The Indians best is a tie at 119 feet by Ben Chapman, Moose
Solters and Jim Shilling. The Cleveland men who developed the speed meter
said the only comparable scientific marks were made in 1917. Walter Johnson
threw the ball 134 feet a second, Christy Mathewson 127 and 'Smoky Joe'
Wood 124. Their speeds were shown by a gravity drop interval recorder. In
the contest that counts, the Indians edge the Red Sox, 8-7.

1940
Warren Spahn, who will become the winningest left-hander in baseball history
with 363 victories, signs a contract with the Boston Bees (Braves). Due to

the 19-year-old southpaw will have to wait six years before he gets his
first major league win.

1941
The Giants become the first baseball team to wear protective headgear. The
plastic helmets don't provide a defense against defeats when the team drops
both ends of a doubleheader to Pittsburgh at the Polo Grounds, 5-4 and 4-3. In
game 2, Pittsburgh P Rip Sewell sets an NL record by handling 11 assists.

Danny Litwhiler's 2nd inning infield single is the only hit given up by

hands on Litwhiler's grounder but fumbles it and it is ruled a hit.

1942

win, 3-0. He'll win his 251st in 8 days defeating the Browns.

Baseball cancels today's scheduled eight-game slate due to the Allied invasion
of Normandy. The military operation, known as D-Day, has 60,000 Allied troops
landing along a heavily protected 50-mile stretch of the coastline in France
to fight Germany to begin an offensive assault against Hitler and the Nazi
party. Yesterday was an off-day after all teams played Saturday doubleheaders.

Annabelle Lee, aunt of future major leaguer Bill Lee, pitches the
first of five perfect games in the 12-year history of the All-American
Girls Professional Baseball League. The Minneapolis Millerettes southpaw
knuckleballer, who will also pitch a no-hitter for the Fort Wayne Daisies
exactly one year from this date, doesn't allow any batters to reach first
base in the 18-0 rout of the Kenosha (Wis) Comets.

1945
In the first of 2 at Boston, Boo Ferris scatters 14 hits in beating the A's,

winning the nitecap, 3-2. Ferriss pinch hits in the nitecap, hitting into
a DP.

Senator Langer, Republican of SD, introduces a bill in Congress that would
require that 10% of ML rosters be made up of war veterans missing an arm,
leg, foot or hand. "Congress has the right to do this because it controls
interstate congress," he says, adding, "I'm serious about this." The bill
doesn't get to first bsae.

two. Phils pitcher Charlie Bicknell gives up 18 total bases in the inning. The
Cards take the 2nd game, 2-0, on Al Brazle's 5-hitter. Schoendienst bangs 5
doubles and a homer for the afternoon, after clouting 3 doubles yesterday,
and ties a record for most extra base hits in two consecutive games with
7. Only 2 other players in history (Earl Sheely, 1926 and Ed Delahanty,
1896) have tallied 7 extra base hits in 2 games (Joe Adcock in 1954 will
become the 4th).

Ted Williams, Stan Spence and Vern Stephens hit successive HRs for the Red
Sox against Freddie Hutchinson of the Tigers. It is the 2nd 3-straight-HR

1983
The Twins select pitcher Tim Belcher with the first pick in the annual
June free-agent draft, but Belcher will reject their $125,000 signing bonus
offer and pitch for Team USA in the Pan American Games instead. He is the
only first-rounder who doesn't sign. Belcher will be the first selected
in the January 1984 draft. The Twins 2nd round pick, P Billy Swift, also
doesn't sign. The Reds take Kurt Stillwell with the 2nd pick overall and

down a larger offer from Milwaukee to stay in Cleveland.

1984

1990
A week after the Mets fire their manager, the Yankees follow suit. Bucky
Dent, the Yank's skipper for just 89 games, is replaced by Stump Merrill,
who managed the Columbus farm team. During Merrill's two-year tenure in

the end of next season in favor of Buck Showalter.

For the 2nd time this season, Cecil Fielder belts 3 HRs in a game, as

Baltimore's Cal Ripken strains his right knee during a 7th inning brawl
between the Orioles and Mariners, putting his consecutive game streak in

for their involvement in the melee which begins when Seattle C Bill Haselman
charges the mound. The Orioles eventually win the game by a score of 5-2.

2000
Depending on your point of view, today is a dark day or a great one for
baseball at Edison Field in Anaheim. Thanks to the Angels' video crew playing
a clip from the 1994 movie "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective" on the JumboTron,
the Rally Monkey is born. With the words "Rally Monkey" superimposed over
a monkey jumping up and down in the Jim Carrey movie, the crowd goes wild
when Anaheim scores two runs in the bottom of the ninth to beat the Giants,
6-5. Down to the Giants by 3 runs in the 7th, the rally monkey makes his
first appearance on the Diamondvision. In the 9th Erstad's single ties it
and Mo Vaughan's single wins it, all against Robb Nen. Salmon homers in the
8th. The Giants took a 3-run lead in the 3rd on a 2-run homer by Benard

of the year, and it is the longest HR ever hit at Edison.

2001

2003
Insisting the corked bat, designed to put on homerun displays during batting
practice, was accidentally used in the Devil Rays' game, Cubs' slugger Sammy
Sosa is suspended for eight games by major League baseball. Bob Watson,
baseball's vice president of on-field operations, agreed the Chicago's
outfielder use of an illegal bat was an "isolated incident," but one that
still deserved a penalty.

2004
In 50 rounds in baseball's 2004 amateur draft a total of 1,498 players are
taken; 559 right-handed pitchers, 234 left-handed pitchers, 331 infielders,
248 outfielders and 126 catchers. The 30 big-league clubs drafted 996
college players, 494 high-schoolers and eight players affiliated with
neither a high school nor a college. California leads the way among the
50 states providing 270 draftees while Florida was second with 172. The
Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins selected the most players choosing 54
each. The Padres, picking first, take into account signability and select
prep SS Matt Bush. Detroit takes Justin Verlander with the 2nd pick and
Milwaukee chooses Mark Rogers with #5. A day after Rice loses to Texas
A&M in the College WS, three of its pitchers are chosen in the top 10:
the Mets pick Phillip Humber at #3, Tampa Bay takes 6'9" Jeff Niemann,
who was 17-0 as a sophomore, at #4, and Baltimore uses their #9 pick to
take Wade Townsend. None of the three will sign this year, and Humber will
sign January 11, 2005, a day before a change in the federal tax law makes
signing bonuses subject to Medicare and Social Security taxes. Townsend
will return to Rice, though he will not play baseball. Several brothers
of major leaguers go on the first round:  Jared Weaver, brother of Jeff,
goes to the Angels with #12, and highly rated SS Stephen Drew, brother of
JD, goes to the D'backs at #15. The Cubs top pick, P Grant Johnson, won't
sign till August, miss the fall season to go back to Notre Dame, and miss
spring 2005 with an injury. He'll finally debut in low class A in June 2005.

2005
Bambi's revenge. Colorado SS Clint Barmes, hitting .329, falls while carrying
frozen venison up a flight of stairs and breaks his collarbone. Barmes
initially says he was carrying groceries up the stairs, but later, he will
change his story saying it was not groceries, but a package of deer meat
that he got from Todd Helton. Helton will confirm that they were riding all
terrain vehicles, but insists that breach of contract was unrelated to the
injury. The Rockies place SS Clint Barmes on the 60 day DL but he is out
for the season. The Rocks call up C Danny Ardoin and INF Tim Olson.

2006
When Eric Gagne, who will earn his first save in over a year, throws
his first pitch to his receiver Russell Martin, the pair become the first
All-French-Canadian battery in major league history. The pitcher and catcher

schools in Montreal which had a baseball program.

On the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of the century, the

outs set in 1966 by Gaylord Perry.

The Reds obtain P Esteban Yan from the Angels in exchange for minor league
P Kyle Edens.

The Royals select former U of Tennessee pitcher Luke Hochevar with the
1st pick of the ML draft. Hochevar had been drafted by the Dodgers last
year, but failed to reach a deal with the team. The next five picks are
all from college:  Stanford's Gregory Reynolds (Col); Evan Longoria (TB);
Brad Lincoln (Pit); Brandon Morrow (Sea); Andrew Miller (Det). Picking 7th,
the Dodgers take high schooler Clayton Kershaw; the draft will eventually
be comprised of 36% high schoolers. The Cubs surprise with the 13th pick
and take Clemson's Tyler Colvin, projected by Baseball America as a 5th
rounder. Picking 18th, the Phillies choose the first of a number of ML
offspring as they select Doug Drabek's son, Kyle. The Dodgers will pick
Preston Mattingly, Don's son, and the Mets will take Jesse Barfield's son,
Jeremy. The Papelbon brothers Jeremy (19th round, Cubs) and Josh (48th round,
Red Sox) are both taken out of the U of North Florida. The Orioles draft
the Figueroa twins, Stephen and Justin, sons of Bien Figueroa, Baltimore's
class A manager for Frederick. In the 5th round, the Cubs take Notre Dame
all-American Wide Receiver Jeff Samardzija, a P, and eventually sign him
for a guaranteed $10 million contract, including a $2.5 million signing
bonus. Samardzija, who holds all of Notre Dame's notable receiving records,
was considered a questionable baseball signing. They also pay $1.3 million to
11th round high schooler Chris Huseby. Huseby barely pitched in the spring
while recovering from Tommy John surgery. Not drafted are Jeffrey Maier,
who hit .403 in Division 3, but is better known as the 12-year-old who
interfered with a ball to help the Yankees, and Danny Almonte, who made
headlines as an overage Little League P.

Federal investigators search Diamondbacks P Jason Grimsley's house as part of
an investigation into steroid use in baseball. Grimsley originally cooperated

career. Grimsley will be released at his own request on Wednesday.

2007
At PETCO Park, Trevor Hoffman becomes the first reliever to save 500 games. It

2008
At Turner Field, Brad Lidge gets his 16th consecutive save when Gregor Blanco
is thrown out at home plate, dramatically ending the game and preserving a

record from the start of the season breaks Al Holland's club record, who
converted his first 15 opportunities in 1984.

Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski announces the club is optioning
their off-season blockbuster acquisition Dontrelle Willis to their Class A
minor league team in Lakeland of the Florida State League. The 2003 Rookie

recently signed a three-year $29 million deal to play with Detroit.

2010

over Pittsburgh.

2013
With John Sebastian's song "Welcome Back" playing in the background, the
Seattle fans give Ichiro Suzuki a warm reception when the longtime Mariner
legend returns to Safeco Field as a Yankee. The 39-year-old outfielder,
who hit .322 during his 12 seasons with the team, was traded to the Bronx
last July for Danny Farquhar and D.J. Mitchell.

2017
Scooter Gennett of the Reds became the 17th player in Major League history

the third inning, a two-run homer in the fourth, a solo shot in the sixth,
and another two-run homer in the eighth. Gennett also became the first player
in Major League history with five hits, four homers and 10 RBI's in a game.
