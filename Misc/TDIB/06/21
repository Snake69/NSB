1906
At the Polo Grounds, umpire Bob Emslie tosses John McGraw in the 4th inning,
but his fellow ump Hank O'Day goes one better banishing Joe McGinnity and

innings. Mathewson, in relief of Bill Perritt in the 9th, takes the loss.

1917
In a game against Salt Lake City, Red McKee of the San Francisco Seals (PCL),

12-6 win. The highlight in the big inning is Jeff Heathcote with a homerun
and double.

Boston's Carl Mays pitches his 2nd one-hitter against the A's this year,
beating Philadelphia, 13-0. This time it is Jake Munch who has the lone
single, a scratch hit in front of the plate that Mays fields rather than
C Wally Schang.

Walter Johnson wins his 12th straight, though it takes him 13 innings to
do it, as he beats New York, 3-2. Clyde Milan, whose muff in the 9th with
2 outs allows the tying run to score, drives in the game winner with a single.

1919

off Johnson - he hit his first ML homer off the Big Train last month - but
that's all the scoring for the A's as Washington wins, 11-3. A's OF Tilly
Walker, hitting .275, quits the team after 52 games to go back to Kentucky
where he'll be a state trooper and ump in the Appalachian League. Walker
hit 37 HRs and 100+ RBI in 1923, but Mack benched him for a faster outfielder.

Pipp's RBI. Both teams score in the 12th.

1927
A day after his extra-base hit streak (12 doubles, 4 triples, 4 homers)
is stopped at 14 straight games, a NL record, Pirates OF Paul Waner's
23-game hitting streak ends. Waner, in his 2nd season, will lead the NL
with a .380 BA, 237 hits and 131 RBI. His brother Lloyd will gather 223
hits for a .355 BA in this, his rookie year. They pace the 1927 Pirates to
a team BA of .305. Today the Reds win 7-6, in 10 innings. Barnhart has a
hit to run his streak to 21 straight games.

Boston edges the New York Giants, 7-5 in 10 innings, behind the heavy hitting
of Shanty Hogan. Hogan gets into a punching match with Heinie Mueller in
the 8th inning, hits his first ML homer in the 9th, off Burleigh Grimes,
to tie the game, then hits a 2-run homer in the 10th to win it.

The Cardinals sweep two games from the Cubs, but lose SS Tommy Thevenow when
he breaks his leg in the 4th inning of the 2nd game. It will be Rabbit redux,
as Maranville will be signed to take the shortstop spot. Jess Haines wins
the opener, 6-5 in 13 innings, over Charlie Root, who twice is given extra
inning leads. Flint Rhem coasts to a 12-3 win in the nitecap as the Cards slam
Buck Brillheart. Jim Bottomley chips in with a ML record-tying three triples.

1928
In Chicago, the Cubs split with the Cards, winning 2-1 before losing 4-1. In
the nitecap, Hack Wilson grounds out in the 9th, then climbs into the stands
to swing at heckling fan, Edward Young. Teammates pull Wilson off before
he does much damage.

1929
The A's and Yankees split a pair at the Stadium, with the A's winning game 1,
11-1. Al Simmons scores 5 runs. New York takes the 2nd game, 8-3.

1930
At Shibe Park, Ruth clouts two homers ... in the first and third innings
off George Earnshaw ... to get New York to a 6-0 lead. But Philadelphia
scores 9 runs in the 7th inning and wins 15-7. The Yanks last run is a solo
shot by Ruth off Lefty Grove in the 8th inning. Unconcerned, the A's take
the nitecap as well, 4-1, with New York's only run coming on a tremendous
homer by Ruth when the ball lands in a back yard a block away from the park,
reputedly the longest ball ever hit at Shibe.

1931

pitching of Schoolboy Rowe. Rowe's wife had just given birth.

Babe Herman, on waivers from Pittsburgh, returns to Cincinnati.

1936
At Brooklyn, the visiting Cubs take the opener, 7-2, behind Curt Davis,
but in the nitecap, Van Mungo stops the Cubs' win streak at 15, by winning
6-4. Charlie Grimm socks a pinch homer in the 8th of game 2, but it's not
enough as Bill Lee takes the loss. The Cubs are now a half game behind
the Cards, who lose to the Giants. The Cubs' win streak will be their 2nd
longest of the 20th century ... last year's 21-game skein is the longest.

Washington rookie Sid Hudson takes a no-hitter into the 9th inning, but the
Browns' Rip Radcliff hits a pop fly double down the RF line with no outs. A
passed ball puts him on 3rd, but Hudson retires 3 for a 1-0 win. He'll beat
the A's on a one-hit shutout in August.

1941
In New York's 7-2 loss to the Tigers at Yankee Stadium, Phil Rizzuto's

established by Detroit, is only the light-hitting shortstop's second
career homerun.

At Boston, Lefty Grove finally loses at Fenway after 20 consecutive wins
at home, as the Browns pound the Red Sox, 13-9. Grove is knocked out in 2nd
inning. Harland Clift leads the day's slugging with 2 doubles and a triple,
good for 4 RBIs. Grove's streak began on May 3, 1938. He'll end this year
with a record of 55-17 (1934-41), and his .764 winning percentage is the
highest ever for a lefty at Fenway.

1942
Ted Lyons (5-5) wins his 250th career game, 6-5 over Boston's Dick Newsome. A
week from now he will beat New York's Red Ruffing to match the Yankee

Van Mungo, Lou Finney, Chubby Dean, Nate Andrews and Max Butcher are all
playing in Class D leagues.

1950
Joe DiMaggio gets his 2,000th hit, a 7th-inning single off the Indians'
Chick Pieretti, as the Yanks win 8-2. DiMaggio joins Luke Appling and Wally
Moses as the only active players with 2,000 or more hits. Eddie Lopat is
the winning pitcher, running his record against Cleveland to 25-6.

Renegade ball player Danny Gardella admits accepting a pay-off to drop
his suit against baseball. After a month long tryout with the Cardinals,
and one at-bat, Gardella had been sent to their Houston farm club where,
shortly afterward, he was released. Gardella argues that he should be paid
for the entire year, and he blames his release on his suit against the ML.

Phils rookie Bob Miller (6-0) continues his unbeaten streak, turning back

professional baseball using the ruling to prevent teams from using women
players as a publicity stunt.

2 by a score of 10-3. This loss is the first in a streak of nine straight.

Mantle clouting another homer, off Art Ditmar.

At Boston, Ted Williams hits a 3-0 pitch for a 3-run homer off Ned Garver
and the Sox come from behind in the 8th inning to beat Detroit, 5-4. It

one-hitters, as Jack Harshman of the White Sox beats the combined efforts of
Orioles Connie Johnson (7 IP) and George Zuverink (1 IP) to win, 1-0. Harshman
gives up a 7th inning double to Gus Triandos. The Sox score in the first
on a walk, stolen base and a double by Nellie Fox. For Harshman, it is his
3rd shutout of the year and he has now thrown 20 straight scoreless innings.

On Father's Day at Shea Stadium, Jim Bunning fans 10, drives in 2 runs, and
pitches the first perfect game (excluding Don Larsen's 1956 WS effort and
Harvey Haddix' 1959 overtime loss) since Charlie Robertson's on April 30,
1922. Philadelphia beats the Mets 6-0. He also becomes the first pitcher to
throw no-hitters in both leagues, and Gus Triandos becomes the first C to
catch a no-hitter in each league. Bunning throws just 90 pitches in winning
his 2nd no-hitter. The next time Bunning faces the Mets he will shut them
out, the first no-hit pitcher this century to do that. The Mets don't fare
much better in the nitecap as 18-year-old rookie Rick Wise wins his 1st game
(despite four errors made by the Phillies) and gives up just 3 hits for an
8-2 win (his first of 188 career wins). Johnny Klippstein comes on in the
9th. The Phils increase their NL lead to 2 games over the Giants.

from Chicago in 11 days.

1966
In the first game of a twinbill, there are 2 on and 2 outs in the 9th inning
when Frank Robinson makes a spectacular catch against New York's Roy White,
diving into the stands over the short right field fence and disappearing
from view. He emerges with the ball and it is ruled a catch, preserving a
7-5 Baltimore victory, rather than an 8-7 defeat. Robby will do it again
on August 11th.

Satchel Paige makes his final pro pitching appearance, going the first
2 innings for Peninsula (Carolina L) against Greensboro. Satch gives up
2 runs. As noted by historian Bill Deane, Peninsula's regular catcher,
Johnny Bench, took the night off.

1968
It's been a bad week for the Cubs, but they end their scoreless streak at
48 innings, tying a ML mark set in 1906, beating the Reds, 3-2, behind
Joe Niekro. George Culver is the losing pitcher, allowing the Cubs' 1st
score in the 3rd inning when he gives up a walk with the sacks full. The
five straight shutout losses also ties a league mark. The streak started
on June 15 ... the final 8 innings of a loss to Atlanta; then a 1-0 loss
to Phil Niekro in 11 innings; a 1-0 loss to Cards Nels Briles; a 4-0 one

Oakland, and sets a ML record for runs in the 10th in winning 14-4. The
Twins send 16 batters to the plate in the frame garnering 8 hits, 4 walks
and 3 errors. Killebrew's 3-run homer is the big blow. Minnesota's 11 match
the New York Yankees' 12th inning of July 26, 1928, for most runs for one
club in extra innings, and shatters the previous high for the 10th inning
of 8 runs. The A's add a run of their own in the 10th to set a record (12)
for runs in the 10th by 2 clubs. Yesterday, Oakland won, 3-2, in 14 innings.

Willie Horton clubs 2 homers, one a grand slam, and drives in 6 runs to power
the Tigers to a 9-5 win over the visiting Senators. Willie also gets nabbed

(8-1) is the winner, allowing just 4 hits, including a pair of homers.

At Fenway, the Yankees and Red Sox split an exciting pair of games in a
day-night separate admission matchup. 12,453 watch the opener where the

Sox score 4 times to win. Thomas drives in the tying and winning runs. Jerry
Kenney has a pair of stolen bases in the game, but is nabbed on the hidden
ball trick by 1B George Thomas (as noted by Bill Deane, this is one of the
few times in history that two hidden ball tricks have been pulled off on
the same day). New York wins the nitecap, 6-3, on Roy White's bases loaded
triple in the 9th.

1970
Cleveland wins the first game against Detroit, 2-1, but Detroit's Cesar
Gutierrez then goes 7 for 7 with 6 singles and a triple to tie a record set
in 1892, in a 12-inning 9-8 nitecap win. Mickey Stanley's HR wins it for
the Tigers. Gutierrez, wearing #7, started the game hitting .218, and was
on a 0 for 18 hitless streak. Gutierrez will collect just 7 hits in all of
1971, and 128 hits for his career. The Detroit shortstop will finish his
brief four-year major league career with a .235 lifetime batting average.

1971
Behind Dock Ellis' 9th straight victory, the Pirates down the Mets, 4-0,
and take a 4 1/2 game lead in the NL East. Willie Stargell has a 2-run
HR to help Ellis. Three double plays help as does 1B Bob Robertson, who

manager Tommy Lasorda is hired as GM on an interim basis. Glenn Hoffman,
who managed the team's Triple-A Albuquerque farm club, takes over as
interim manager.

1999
Blue Jay Tony Fernandez becomes the Dominican-born career hits leader with
his 2,178th hit to move ahead of Julio Franco. The shortstop's hit plated
the winning run with two outs in the ninth in Toronto's 2-1 victory over
Kansas City.

2000
The A's defeat the Orioles, 10-3, as Eric Chavez becomes the first Oakland
player to hit for the cycle at home since the team moved to Oakland in
1968. It is the A's 8th straight win, a streak they haven't done since 1994.

The Mets announce that SS Rey Ordonez will be out for the season because
his broken left forearm is not healing properly.

2001
Returning to the major leagues after a stint with the Newark Bears of the
independent Atlantic League, Jose Canseco starts as the designated hitter for
the White Sox. The former All-Star, who has 446 career home runs (23rd all
time), didn't get any offers after being released by the Angels in the spring.

In a slugfest between Seattle and Oakland, the brothers Giambi each homer,
Jason in the 4th and Jeremy in the 5th. But the M's get a pinch 3-run homer
from Bret Boone and another 3-run homer from Mike Cameron to win, 12-10.

It looks like homerun derby as 9 homeruns are hit in the Reds' 8-7 win
in 11 innings over the Astros. Craig Biggio hits a leadoff homer - a feat
he will duplicate tomorrow - and Lance Berkman clubs 2 homeruns. Michael
Tucker hits a pair of homers for the Reds.

The Giants beat the Padres, 8-6, as OF Barry Bonds hits his 38th HR to set
a new mark for homers hit before the All-Star break.

In the annual Congressional baseball game, the Republicans defeat the
Democrats, 9-1. Republican Congressman Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a former NFL
great, strikes out 8 while allowing just 6 hits and no walks. The Dems can
breathe easier next year since Largent will be resigning his seat to run for
governor. The elephants have compiled a 26-14 record since the Congressional
newspaper, Roll Call, began sponsoring the game in 1962. Before 1962, the
game was played intermittently beginning when former major-leaguer John
Tener, then a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, organized the first
contest in 1909.

2002
During the New York-Penn League game between the New Jersey Cardinals and the
Staten Island Yankees, a fan hops a fence and goes onto the field to argue an
umpire's call at first base. The 38-year-old woman, who will face disorderly
person charges, is at the game with her 8-year old daughter's Brownie troop.

Luis Castillo hits safely in his 35th consecutive game tying Fred Clarke
(1895), Ty Cobb (1917) and George Sisler (1924-25) for the tenth longest
streak in major league history. The Marlin infielder's third inning infield
hit off knuckleballer Steve Sparks' glove also surpasses Benito Santiago
in 1987 for the longest streak established by a Latin player.

2003
Tied 2-2 after nine innings at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, the Phillies
defeat the Red Sox, 6-5 on pinch-hitter Todd Pratt's 2-out 2-run HR in the
13th inning. The Phils score 3 in the frame. Each team scored one run in the
12th. Nomar Garciaparra strokes a team-record tying 6 hits (all singles)
for Boston, and adds a walk. Todd Walker has two homers, off Wolf, and
Kevin Millar has a pair of doubles and a triple. Jim Thome clouts homers
in the 8th and the 12th.

The Pirates edge the Indians, 7-6, in 15 innings for their 2nd consecutive
15-inning victory over the Tribe. It is the first time since 1996 that two
teams have played back-to-back 15 inning affairs.

The red-hot Dodgers beat Anaheim, 4-2, capitalizing on Adrian Beltre's
3-run HR. Eric Gagne picks up his 27th save despite allowing 3 hits in the
9th. For the 3rd time (April 27, June 18) this season, Bengie Molina pinch
hits for his brother, Jose, singling against Gagne for a run.

2005
General manager Dan O'Brien meets face to face with Reds skipper Dave Miley
(125-164 total, 27-43 this season) to inform the third-year manager of his
decision to fire him. Former Ranger manager Jerry Narron becomes the 58th
manager in Reds history.

After building a 10-2 lead at Yankee Stadium, the Rays lose to the Bronx
Bombers, 20-11, making it the second time in franchise history the team
is ahead by eight or more runs and loses by nine or more tallies. No other
club in baseball history has ever achieved this dubious distinction as the
D-Rays with their 1999 defeat to the Indians now have accomplished the feat
twice. Tampa Bay gives up 13 runs in the bottom of the 8th inning. They
become the first team in history to yield that many tallies in one inning
twice during the same season. The benefactor each time is the Yankees as
the visiting Tampa Bay hurlers also had a 13-run melt down on April 18
at the stadium. The Bombers set a total bases record in the 8th with 27,
while the two teams combine for a AL record-tying 77 total bases (TB 32,
NY, 45) in the game. Derek Jeter leads the 23-hit NY attack with 5 hits,
including a 2B and HR and scores 5 runs. Gary Sheffield hits a pair of
homers and drives in 7 runs.

The Angels trip the Rangers, 8-6, as Darin Erstad has 3 hits and extends
his hitting streak to 21 consecutive games.

2006
At New York, the Reds score two runs in the 9th on Brandon Phillips' single
and edge the Mets, 6-5. The bright spot for the Mets is Jose Reyes, who hits
for the cycle. The 23-year-old Reyes is the youngest major-league switch
hitter to hit for the cycle. He is the ninth player in Mets history to hit
for the cycle. The shortstop from the Dominican Republic hits a leadoff
homer in the bottom of the first inning followed by a double in the third,
then a triple in the fifth, and completes the feat with an eighth inning
single at Shea Stadium.

Jason Marquis of the St. Louis Cardinals goes five innings against the White
Sox and allows all 13 earned runs in the 13-5 loss. He is just the fourth
pitcher since 1958 to allow that many. The others since 1958 who gave up
at least 13 were Bill Travers of the 1977 Milwaukee Brewers (at Cleveland,
7.2 IP, 14 ER), David Wells of the 1992 Toronto Blue Jays (at Milwaukee,
4.1 IP, 13 ER) and Mike Oquist of the 1998 Oakland Athletics (vs. New
York Yankees, 5.0 IP, 14 ER). Marquis allows 14 hits, 8 for extra bases,
including four homers:  Paul Konerko in the 1st, Jim Thome, who has 4 hits,
in the 2nd; Joe Crede in the 3rd and Juan Uribe in the 5th.

Ichiro Suzuki is 2 for 5 in the Mariners' 8-5 win over the host Dodgers
and extends his consecutive game batting streak to 20 games. He is the
first batter since Joe DiMaggio (1936-41) to record four hitting streaks
of 20 or more games in his first six seasons. Ichiro has posted 22 hitting
streaks of 10 games or more since joining the Mariners in 2001.

The Arizona Diamondbacks hand pitcher Russ Ortiz (0-5) his release while
still owing him $22.5 million on the four-year $33 million contract to which
they signed him before the 2005 season. According to the Washington Post,
Ortiz became the most expensive cut player in baseball history. The Orioles
will sign Ortiz on June 25, but he will go 0-3 with the Birds and his ERA
will top eight.

2009
Tony La Russa gets his 2,500th victory as a manager when the Cardinals defeat
Kansas City at Kauffman Stadium, 12-5. Joining Connie Mack and John McGraw,
the Redbird skipper, who also piloted the White Sox and A's, becomes only
the third major league manager to reach the milestone.

2015
Melissa Mayeux becomes the first female to be placed on the Major League
Baseball's international registration list, making her eligible to be
signed by pro teams on July 2. The 16-year-old shortstop of the French
U-18 junior national team campaigned successfully to abolish the country's
"no-girls-allowed" rule, so she could keep competing with the boys.

2016
Dean Kremer becomes the first-ever Israeli to sign a contract with a Major
League baseball team when he comes to terms with the Dodgers, after being
selected in the annual amateur draft earlier this month. The 20-year-old
right-hander, who won Europe's Most Valuable Pitcher award in both 2014
and 2015, has hurled for Israel's national baseball team for the past
three seasons.

Erik Kratz, who tossed an ineffective inning for the Astros in an 11-1 rout
by the Angels in April, becomes the first player in the modern era to catch
and pitch for two teams in the same season when he throws a scoreless ninth
inning in relief in the Pirates' 15-4 loss to the Giants at PNC Park. The 36
year-old journeyman backstop, who was obtained from the Halos earlier in the
month, allows two hits, striking Brandon Belt for the first out of the frame.

2019
Robinson Cano recorded his 550th career double in the eighth inning against
the Chicago Cubs. He became the 31st player to reach this mark.
