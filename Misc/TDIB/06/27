1904

Doyle for $4500 from Mattoon (Kitty L.).

1908
At Brooklyn, the Giants win two from the Superbas, 4-3 and 5-2. Mathewson

into the batter's box to lead off and hits Ed Karger's warm-up pitch for an
inside-the-park HR while the Red Sox are still taking their positions. Boston
manager Patsy Donovan protests to ump Ben Egan, but Egan rejects the protest
on the basis of Ban Johnson's new rule prohibiting warm-up pitches. The A's
win, 7-3. Ban Johnson's time-saving rule, which declares that pitchers must
throw as soon as the batter is in the box, is soon withdrawn.

White Sox ace Ed Walsh shuts out the Tigers, 3-0. Cobb is held to an infield
single and then is cut down stealing.

caught a base runner three times (New York's Fritz Maisel, April 26). On

steal, and not until Rickey Henderson, in 1982, will an AL runner be cut
down thrice in a game.

in 10 innings, giving up 4 hits. The winning HR is hit by the other newcomer,
Billy Southworth. The Cubs win the nitecap, 5-0, in a game interrupted by
a shower of pop bottles in the 9th inning as the crowd protests a call by
umpire Charlie Moran. Moran ruled Sparky Adams safe at 1B, despite popping
out to Hornsby, because of catcher interference.

The first-place Reds rout the Pirates, 16-0, and turn a triple play (Emmer,
Dressen, Bressler) in the process. Pete Donohue is the easy winner.

1930
The A's get slugging from their pitchers, but split a twinbill with the
Browns. Lefty Grove hits a homer in the first game, but five A's boots give
the Browns an 8-2 win. Dick Coffman scatters 11 hits to win. In game 2,
Jack Quinn, A's pitcher who is 8 days shy of his 46th birthday, becomes
the oldest player to hit a HR (a solo shot) when he connects against the
Browns' Chad Kimsey. Quinn also picks up the victory, 8-3. Fellow sluggers
Foxx and Simmons add homers.

A Ladies Day crowd swells the Wrigley Field attendance to a park record
51,556 (just 19,748 paid) to watch the Cubs' 7-5 win over Brooklyn. Kiki

The Pirates hold off a 9th inning rally by the Phils to win their 3rd
straight over their cross-state rivals. Heine Meine is the winner, despite
giving up 12 hits, including two doubles and two triples by Lefty O'Doul.

1931
At St. Louis, Larry Bettencourt hits the first pitch in the bottom of

15-8, behind Earnshaw. In game 1, Chicago is paced by Bob Johnson, who hits
2 homers including a grand slam.

1934
The temperature reaches 115 degrees at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis. Dizzy
Dean leaves the game with 2 outs and the score tied 7-7 in the top of the
9th. Reliever Jim Mooney retires Mel Ott, and when Bill Delancey homers in
the bottom of the inning to win the game, Dean is given credit for the win,
his 12th of the year, though he wasn't the pitcher of record when the winning
run scores. As on the 24th, Mike Haley, the scorer who had been overruled
earlier that day, is the scorer and gives the win to Dean. Taking no chances,
he asks Heydler to review his decision and Heydler agrees.

1937
Backed by two Mel Ott HRs, Carl Hubbell outpitches Dizzy Dean to give the
Giants an 8-1 win over the Cards. This is the last time the two Hall of
Famers will face each other. Hubbell is 6-4 in games in which they've both
had decisions, Dean is 4-6 (reliever Schindler beat Dean 8/25/34; reliever
Paul Dean beat Hubbell 7/26/34; Hubbell beat reliever Walker 9/14/36).

1939
The Dodgers and Bees play a 23-inning 2-2 game at Boston, called on account
of darkness after 5 hours 15 minutes. Whit Wyatt (7-0) pitches the first
16 innings for the Dodgers. The two teams total 30 hits and 12 walks. The
Bees seemingly have the game won in the 13th when pinch-runner Otto Huber
rounded third base with room to spare. But he slipped and could not recover
in time. In a story that Casey Stengel repeated for years, he asked Huber
after the game why he was wearing his old baseball shoes with worn spikes
instead of the new pair. Huber replied that they hurt his feet. From then
on Stengel made sure to look at the shoes of pinch runners before putting
them into the game.

Bob Feller allows just one hit as Cleveland beats Bobo Newsom and the
Tigers, 5-0.

1940
To honor the lyricist of Take Me Out to the Ballgame, Jack Norworth Day is
celebrated at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Norworth nor his partner, Albert
Von Tilzer, who wrote the music, had never seen a game when they created the
song in 1908. Today is the first baseball game Norworth has ever seen. Von
Tilzer, waited 20 years to see his first game (according to columnist Hal
Lebovitz). The Dodgers manage a 5-4 win over the Cubs to move a game and
a half behind the first place Reds.

is lifted for a pinch hitter in the 8th, Cal rolls to a 17-4 win.

The Atlanta Braves back off from their decision to bar from their chartered
flights 4 team announcers who had raised questions about the catcher's
box at Turner Field. After TBS discussed the width of the catcher's box
in a game against the Brewers 3 days ago, Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren,
Joe Simpson and Don Sutton were kicked off a flight to Montreal and had
to take a commercial flight. TBS aired a video showing the catcher's box
was 4 to 5 inches smaller than it was the previous night, when Milwaukee
management complained about where Braves catcher Javy Lopez was setting
up. Opposing teams have long said that Atlanta pitchers are given the benefit
of an extra-wide strike zone, particularly on the outside corners. Catchers
who set up wide of the plate can increase the chances of an outside pitch
being called a strike. The video was shown after a rare balk call against
Fernando Lunar, the Braves catcher. Home-plate umpire John Shulock ruled
that Lunar set up with his right foot outside the 43-inch-wide box. The
balk led to Milwaukee's first run and a heated argument between Shulock
and Braves manager Bobby Cox, who was ejected. Atlanta lost the game 2-1.

2002
As part of a six-player deal, the Indians trade their #1 starter, right-hander
Bartolo Colon, to the Expos for first baseman Lee Stevens, three minor
league prospects and cash. In exchange, Cleveland gets top prospect Brandon
Phillips as well as southpaw Cliff Lee and flycatcher Grady Sizemore.

Gregg Zaun turns a 3-4 Houston deficit into a 7-4 win with a pinch grand
slam in the 9th off Arizona's Byung-Hyun Kim.

2003
At Fenway, the Red Sox tie a team record by getting 28 hits in a 25-8
thrashing of the Marlins. Boston scores 14 runs in the 50-minute bottom
of the 1st inning, setting a ML mark by plating 10 runs before an out is
made. Johnny Damon becomes the 2nd player in history to get 3 hits in an
inning with a single, double and triple in the frame. Damon gets 5 hits
altogether. The Sox also tie a mark with 5 players in the inning scoring
twice, and most runs in the 1st inning. Carl Pavano and Tejara allow 10 runs
without recording an out for manager Jack McKeon. The last time that happened
to the 1st two pitchers was 31 years ago at Kansas city when Wayne Simpson
and Ken Wright failed to record an out for - you guessed it - manager Jack
McKeon. Paced by Bill Mueller's 6 RBI, the Sox have 6 players with 3+ RBIs.

Jason Michaels hits a 3-run homer in the top of the 17th, off Omar Daal,
as the Phillies hold on to beat the Orioles, 4-2. The two teams burn through
15 pitchers in the game.

The Blue Jays defeat the Expos, 6-5, as Roy Halladay has his streak of 11
consecutive victories in 11 starts ended with a no-decision.

The Rangers top the Astros, 10-7. Houston's Dave Matranga homers in his
1st ML at-bat, doing so as a pinch-hitter in the 5th inning.

2004
Cal State Fullerton wins the College WS title with a 3-2 win over Texas.

After Danny Bautista of Arizona hits a 3-run homer in the 8th to tie Detroit,
Carlos Pena answers with a walkoff grand slam off Mike Koplove in the bottom
of the 9th. Detroit wins, 9-5.

2006
The Devil Rays trade P Mark Hendrickson, C Toby Hall and $1 million to the
Dodgers for P Jae Seo, C Dioner Navarro and a player to be named.

The Twins defeat the Dodgers, 9-2. Joe Mauer goes 5 for 5 for Minnesota,
raising his BA to a ML-leading .389.

At Rogers Centre, A.J. Burnett tosses a CG shutout as the Blue Jays beat
the Washington Nationals, 6-0. Burnett allows 6 hits and Aaron Hill and
Lyle Overbay hit homers. Helping to spice things up is Toronto pitcher
Gustavo Chacin, who worked offseason in a lab helping technicians at a
Canadian perfumer, Leslie Cosmetics, come up with a new cologne called
"Chacin." Samples of Chacin are handed out to the first 10,000 fans attending
today's game.

2008
In a 15-6 Mets victory over the Yankees at the Stadium, Carlos Delgado, with a
double, three-run homer and a grand slam, establishes a new team record with
9 RBIs in one game. The first baseman, who breaks Dave Kingman's 1976 club
mark, also surpasses Sky King on the all-time home run list with the first
of his two homers, moving into 34th place with his 443rd career round-tripper.

2009
Garret Anderson of the Atlanta Braves hits his 500th career double.

2010
In a surprising swap between last-place teams, the Indians send Russell
Branyan back to the Mariners in exchange for Class AAA outfielder Ezequiel
Carrera and shortstop Juan Diaz. The trade allows the Tribe to put Matt
LaPorta, a highly touted rookie acquired from Milwaukee in the trade for
C.C. Sabathia two years ago, at first base, and for Seattle, the move is
seen as a signal that GM Jack Zduriencik wants his players to know that
winning is still a priority for the under-achieving M's.

Phillies southpaw Jamie Moyer surpasses Hall of Famer Robin Roberts for
allowing the most homeruns in a career. In his 11-2 victory over Toronto,
the 47-year-old starter yields a two-run homer to Vernon Wells in the third
inning for his record breaking 506th gopher ball.

In the fifth inning of an eventual 2-1 Rays' loss to Arizona, Evan Longoria
confronts B.J. Upton in the dugout after the outfielder doesn't appear
to hustle after Rusty Ryal's deep drive to left-center field allowing the
hit to become a triple. The nose-to-nose exchange becomes heated and Upton,
who takes exception to his third baseman's criticism, needs to be restrained
by teammates.

2011
Citing MLB refusal to sign off on a transaction that would provide the team
with $385 million, the Dodgers file for bankruptcy protection in a Delaware
court. Although there will be no disruption in the day-to-day status of
the franchise, the Chapter 11 financing permits the Dodgers to use $150
million for daily operations and gives owner Frank McCourt time to seek a
media deal that will ensure the club's long-term financial stability.

2016
Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant becomes the third major leaguer ever to collect
five extra-base hits in one game, and the first to do so with three homeruns
and two doubles. The 24-year-old Chicago infielder's Great American Ball
Park offensive output joins the ranks of Ranger outfielder Josh Hamilton
(Camden Yards, 2012) and Braves first baseman Joe Adcock (Ebbets Field,
1954), who both hit four homers and a double to accomplish the feat.

2017
Adrian Beltre of the Rangers recorded his 450th career homerun in the ninth
inning against the Cleveland Indians. He became the 39th player to reach
this mark.
