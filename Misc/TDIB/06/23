Red Sox and walks the leadoff man, griping to plate umpire Brick Owens
after each pitch. On ball 4, Ruth plants a right to the umpire's jaw and is
ejected. Ernie Shore hastily relieves and Sam Agnew takes over behind the
plate for Pinch Thomas. The runner, Ray Morgan, is then caught stealing by

without a hit. Jim Bottomley's homer off Fred Fitzsimmons is the only score
for St. Louis, while Johnny Vergez hits one for NY.

In St. Louis, Lou Gehrig plays his 1,103rd successive game in a New York
uniform, equaling Joe Sewell's record with one team (Cleveland). The Yanks
score two in the first when Bump Hadley walks Gehrig and Dickey with the
bases loaded, and he walks three more in the 2nd but escapes unharmed. The
Browns score three runs in each of the first two innings and top the Yanks

nitecap, 3-1.

1934
The Cards beat the Dodgers, 5-4, with the win credited to Bill Hallahan,
who relieves in the 6th inning and gives up a run. In the bottom half,
the Cards score 5 runs, and Dizzy Dean comes in and shuts out Brooklyn in
the last 3 innings. The official scorer refers the decision on the winning
pitcher to NL president Heydler, who gives it to Dean, eventually making
his 30-win season possible. Heydler's telegram (as noted by Bill Deane)
reads in part:  "Dean pitched great ball during three innings to protect a
one-run lead and is the winner. Hallahan pitched one inning rather poorly
and did not stand to lose the game even had he continued."

1935
The Giants' Fred Fitzsimmons picks up his 4th and last victory of the
year, stopping the Cubs on 11 hits and winning, 8-0. All of Freddie's

At Chicago, the White and Red Sox divide a pair, the Pale Hose winning the
opener, 4-2, then losing 8-2. Ted Lyons takes the opener, beating Wes Ferrell,

Brett, starts and ends a triple play. With runners on 2B and 3B in the 6th,

rundown. The runner from 2B also gets trapped in a rundown and Brett makes
the put out.

score 5 runs on 6 hits to win, 7-4. Cincy takes the 2nd game, 2-0. Jurges

Ernie Banks voluntarily takes the bench as a sore knee brings his 717
consecutive-games-played streak to an end. The streak started August 26,

streak of 30 innings before scoring again.

Jimmy Piersall of the New York Mets hits the 100th HR of his ML career -
and his only one in the NL - and celebrates by running around the bases
in the correct order but backwards. The Mets' outfielder thought of the
stunt after being disappointed by the lack of attention Duke Snider's 400th
round-tripper received. Dallas Green of the Phillies, who gave up the HR,
is not amused. Neither is Commissioner Ford Frick, who is in the stands. Nor
are the Mets, and manager Casey Stengel, who will hand Jimmy his walking
papers two days later. The Mets whip the Phils twice, 5-0 and 4-1, behind
Carlton Willey and Tracy Stallard.

A ML fielding record is set by Boston 1B Dick Stuart as "Dr. Strange
Glove" handles 3 first-inning grounders and tosses to P Bob Heffner for

this season against San Francisco in August.

Phillies P Ken Brett beats the Expos, 7-2, and hits a HR for a ML-record 4th

In his major league debut, Orioles P Jesse Jefferson loses his shut out

win. Future ML stars Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken go a combined 6 for 25.

The Roger Maris Museum opens in the West Acres Shopping Center located in
Fargo, North Dakota. Nearly 2,000 visitors are attracted to the 72-foot

career, including a ticket stub from the 162nd game of the 1961 season.

At Wrigley Field, in a game that will be known as the Sandberg game, the
Cubs' Ryne Sandberg goes 5 for 6 with game-tying homeruns off Cardinals
relief ace Bruce Sutter in both the 9th and 10th innings (solo shot and 2-run
homer). He drives in 7 runs to lead Chicago to a 12-11 win in 11 innings. It
is the first time Sutter has given up two HRs to the same batter in the
same game. Dave Owens' base-loaded single wins it. Willie McGee hits for
the cycle and drives in 6 runs in a losing cause.

on June 29th, LaCoss will belt the 2nd and last homer of what will be a
14-year career. That homer will be served up by Tom Browning of the Reds. Iorg
gives up 4 runs in his inning, but does strike out CF Randy Kutcher.

1988
George Steinbrenner fires Billy Martin for the 5th time, replacing him with
Lou Piniella. In 1985, Piniella was fired and replaced by Martin. In 1985,
Martin was fired and replaced by Piniella. New York's 40-28 record is the 4th
best in the big leagues, but the Yankees had just completed a 2-7 road trip.

Clancy, Toronto wins, 5-2. This is the 2nd time in his career Clancy has
started a game this way.

on a 4-0 1-hitter. Umpire Gary Cederstrom calls Greg Gagne safe on a close
play at 1st in the 6th inning, for the Royals only hit, but TV replays show
that Gagne was out. The play went 1B Troy Neel to Witt covering. Witt fans
14 and does not walk a batter in his masterpiece.

The Reds defeat the Giants, 7-5, in a contest that sees SF P Pat Gomez throw
3 consecutive wild pitches in the 8th inning. Gomez' next pitch, like the 3

it, preventing Gomez from becoming just the 3rd pitcher ever to throw 4
wild pitches in an inning.

The Senate Judiciary Committee fails to approve antitrust legislation by
a vote of 10-7. According to Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major
League Players Association, the action leaves the players with little choice
but to strike.

A brawl during a Class A Florida State League game between the Port Charlotte
Rangers and the West Palm Beach Expos results in a record $4,425 in fines,

who escaped without fines or suspensions are either in the clubhouse or
not at the game.

1995
'Marvelous' Marv Throneberry, known best for his antics as a Met, dies from

hits, including homers by Bob Hamelin and Damion Easley, in eight innings.

In Cleveland, Matt Lawton has four hits and Brad Radke wins his fourth
straight start as the Twins top Cleveland, 7-2. Pat Meares has a two-run

At Fenway, Manny Ramirez has 2 homers totaling 964 feet, but he also
leaves the bases loaded twice and the Blue Jays come back on the Red Sox,
9-6. Manny's shots are 463 feet and 501 feet, the latter banging the net
around the coke bottle in left. It's measured at 501 feet, a suspicious
one foot short of Ted Williams 502-foot homer for the Fenway record.

The Yankees attempt to shore up their bullpen by getting P Jay Witasick from
the Padres for infield prospect D'Angelo Jimenez. The Yanks first choice,

one base at a time.

2003
Stealing second base at Pacific Bell Park in the 11th inning, Barry Bonds
becomes the first player to hit 500 homers and steal 500 bases in his
career. The Giants' left fielder may not only be the charter member of the
500-500 club, many believe, including him, he will most likely be the only
member, as no one else may ever reach this plateau. The Giants squeak by
the Dodgers, 3-2 in 11 innings with Barry Bonds scoring the winning run
after the steal.

Behind Phillip Humber's 5-hitter, Rice University trounces Stanford, 14-2,

mark of six straight.

perfect sixth and seventh, striking out three of the six batters he faces,
during a 3-2 loss to the Vancouver Canadians. At 7'1", the right-hander from

2006
White Sox starter Jose Contreras establishes a franchise mark, surpassing
LaMarr Hoyt and Wilson Alvarez, by winning his 16th consecutive decision as

rivals. The Cuban right-hander, whose last defeat occurred on August 15
last season against the Twins, hasn't been beaten in his past 21 regular
season starts.

including a double.

right-hander Felix Hernandez becomes the first pitcher in the 31-year
history of the franchise to hit a homerun. The round-tripper, which comes
off fellow Venezuela ace Johan Santana, is also the first grand slam hit
by an American League pitcher since Steve Dunning of the Indians homered
off A's moundsman Diego Segui in 1971.

2010
In a move that surprises its players, the fourth-place Marlins (34-36)

the time of the departure of their skipper.

2012
Jim Thome sets a major league mark with his 13th career walk-off homerun,
a solo shot over the left-field wall in the bottom of the ninth inning,
giving the Phillies a dramatic 7-6 victory over Tampa Bay. Before today's
historic round-tripper at Citizens Bank Park, the 41-year-old five-time
All Star Thome had shared the record with five Hall of Famers: Jimmie Foxx,
Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth, Stan Musial and Frank Robinson.

2014
Devin Mesoraco becomes the first major leaguer to hit a solo, two-run,
three-run, and grand slam homer sequentially in successive games when he
blasts a ninth-inning four-bagger in the Reds' 6-1 victory over Chicago
at Wrigley Field. The 26-year-old Cincinnati catcher, who will extend his
round-tripper streak to five consecutive games with a solo shot tomorrow,
accomplishes the unusual feat by clearing the fences at PNC Park (solo
HR), Great American Ball Park (two and three-run HRS) and Wrigley Field
(grand slam).
