will outdraw the Beaneaters by 200,000 this season.

1903
Opening a home stand at the Polo Grounds, Christy Mathewson and Chicago's
Jake Weimer battle with Matty taking the loss, 1-0. A walk to Jimmy Slagle
with the bases loaded in the 6th provides Chicago with the needed margin. It
is Matty's first loss in his last 10 decisions and it knocks the Giants
out of first place. They won't be in first the rest of the year.

1904
Joe McGinnity breaks his 2-game losing streak and beats Brooklyn, 5-1. The
Giants are 11-1 against Brooklyn.

1907
In a Giants 4-3 win, Roger Bresnahan is hit in the head by a pitch from Andy
Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds and is given the last rites while he lays on
the field. Hospitalized for 10 days, he will develop a primitive headgear
for batters during his convalescence. Teammate Dan McGann is also hit by a
Coakley pitch in the same inning (4th), breaking his arm, and will be out
of action until the 1st of August. Possibly as a result of the wildness,
Reds C Admiral Schlei puts on shin guards for the 9th inning, the first
Cincy backstop to do so.

1908
The Pirates and Braves swap Youngs:  Pittsburgh acquires P Irv "Cy the second"
Young from Boston (NL) in exchange for Harley Young and P Tom McCarthy. Irv
Young, who averaged 330+ innings the past three seasons, will pitch just
175 this year, and fewer the next 2 seasons, his last, with the White Sox.

The Reds win game 1 of a twinbill against the host Phillies, 1-0, behind
Andy Coakley. It is their 3rd shutout in a row. The Phillies win the 2nd
game, 7-0 behind Frank Corridon, but not before the Reds set a club record
for consecutive shutout innings at 32.

1909
At Cincinnati's "Palace of the Fans" a night game is played between a local

Down 13-1 after 5 1/2 innings, the Tigers make up a 12-run deficit to stage
the biggest comeback (since tied) in ML history, defeating the visiting
Chicago White Sox by a score of 16-15 at Navin Field. Cobb chips in with 4
hits and 5 RBIs, as the Tigers score 5 in the 8th and 3 runs in the 9th. Cobb
gets 2 home to tie in the 9th when he slides into 1B on his grounder to Lord
with 2 on. Both runners score and goes for an error though some think Cobb
had it beat. He scores the winner when Sam Crawford hits a drive over the
head of CF Ping Bodie for a walkoff double. The Tigers use 18 players as
reliever Ed Walsh takes the loss with Clarence Mitchell pitching the last
two innings to win.

The Cubs beat the Phillies 4-3 when, with reliever Earl Moore on the mound,

the A's, as President Taft throws out a belated Opening Day ball. Washington
wins, 5-4, for the Senators' 17th straight win. Their 16 road wins is a
league record until 1984. The A's will stop the win streak on the 19th and
20th by sweeping back-to-back doubleheaders. Frank Baker will go 9 for 15
and drive in the winning runs in three of the victories.

The Pirates use 5 Giants errors and 7 hits off Mathewson for a 7-2 win over
New York.

Mascot, 8, ejected and fired. In a Class C Canadian League the eight-year-old
"mascot" of the Ottawa Senators is ejected for throwing a glove at a Hamilton
player chasing a foul pop near the Ottawa dugout. Ottawa manager Louie
Cook gets upset about the incident, not so much his mascot's intentions,
but his judgment. The Hamilton player had no chance of catching the ball,
but the mascot caused the Ottawa batter to be called out on interference,
and the Senators lose, 4-3. After the game, Cook announces he has "released"
the mascot (as noted by David McDonald).

1915
Ty Cobb collects 3 stolen bases against Washington, all with a wild Joe
Boehling on the mound. Boeling allows 7 walks and 10 hits in 7 innings
while striking out 7. Bull Henry is the starting catcher, but he leaves in
the first inning with a spike wound from Cobb on the front end of a triple
steal. Buff Williams, his replacement, makes 2 errors (one newspaper has
3). The triple steal and two double steals - all involving Cobb - make the
difference in the 5-3 Detroit win.

Jack Quinn, in his only 20-game season, coasts to a 17-10 win as the Orioles
(FL) score 10 runs in the 5th against the visiting KC Packers.

In an 11-4 Chicago win, the White Sox try to steal 11 times against three

Felsch slams a 4th inning grand slam over the right center field fence to
hand an exit pass to Bullet Joe Bush.

Buffalo, 8-0. Percy Dalton has the only hit, a solid single in the 8th.

started in London and that baseball "has aroused such enthusiasm its future
seems assured."

1917
Hooks Dauss shuts out the Senators to give the Tigers a 1-0 win, their 3rd
straight over Washington. Only one man advances as far as 2B. Nats pitcher
Harry Harper gives up the run in the 4th after Ty Cobb walks, steals second
(one of his three) aided by a passed ball, a wild pitch, and Crawford's
ground out. Harper throws over to 1B ten times trying to pick off Cobb.

At the Polo Grounds, Yankee pitcher Ray Fisher walks Burt Shotton, the
Browns leadoff batter, who comes around to score the game's only run. It's
Fisher's only walk, but he loses 1-0 to Bob Groom, who tosses a six-hitter.

On Bunker Hill Day, the Red Sox celebrate by sweeping two from the White
Sox, 6-4 and 8-7. In the afternoon game, Chicago loses a 3-run lead in
the 9th when the Sox use three singles, two errors and a passed ball to
score four runs. Carl Mays and Herb Pennock are the winners, while Babe
Ruth is limited to a pinch hitting appearance in game 2. Bosox players
Ernie Shore and assistant-manager Heinie Wagner are notified that they are
suspended indefinitely for arguments voiced during Friday's game. Chicago
players Weaver and McMullin are served warrants for assault during the
game. The charges were made "by Augustin J. McNally of Norwood, a nearby
suburb." McNally was one of the mob which attempted to break up the game and
"during the fussing, is supposed to have bumped McMullin's fist with his eye
... and to have had his fingers on the railing just when Weaver let his bat
fall." The case is defaulted tomorrow as the players return to Chicago and,
although the original plan was to have a hearing the next month when the
White Sox are in Boston, it will be quietly dismissed.

The NL Board of Directors votes to back President Tener's drastic discipline
of John McGraw and orders the Giants' manager to appear in person to defend
counter charges made by Tener. Tener's actions are based on newspaper accounts
quoting McGraw as saying the league president is incompetent. McGraw is
not allowed to appeal his $500 fine and 16-day suspension resulting in the
run-in with umpire Bryon at Cincinnatti on June 8.

in the 3rd inning and then steals home. Mort Cooper scatters six hits in

At Philadelphia, the Cubs score 5 runs in the 10th inning and then hang on
for a 7-6 victory when the Phils' Cy Williams clubs a grand slam in the
bottom of the 10th in a losing cause. As David Vincent notes, it is the
first of three times in the 20th century that an extra inning grand slam
is hit in a losing cause.

At Cleveland, the Washington Nationals roll to a 19-6 win amassing 25
hits. Goose Goslin, who has a double and a HR, takes exception to a close
pitch by King Cole in the 6th and heads towards the mound with a bat. Umpire
Connolly tackles him. Goose then grounds out 3-1 and barrels into Cole
covering 1B. Ump Evans steps between the two. The crowd showers Goose with
pop bottles as he heads towards the dugout and Connolly mercifully banishes
Goslin from the game. The Nats lead 11-4 at the time.

raise the Cardinals' NL pennant before a 6-4 win over the Giants. Rogers
Hornsby makes his first appearance in St. Louis since the big trade of last
fall and Cards owner Sam Breadon picks today to raise the pennant and hand
out Series rings. The Rajah has a double in the game, off Pete Alexander,
but Jim Bottomley's 3-run homer for the Cards offsets that.

Continuing a feud that dates back to Smith's days with the Braves, Pirates
C Earl Smith decks Braves manager Dave Bancroft with a right to the jaw
after they exchange words in the 7th inning. Bancroft is carried off the
field. Smith draws a $500 fine and 30-day suspension. The Pirates score 3
in the 1st led by Paul Waner's 2-run triple enroute to a 7-4 win. Waner

row, Joe Boley bunts for a safety. Enter a new pitcher and exit Ferrell,
who throws his mitt into the stands.

Dizzy Dean of the Cubs, trying to regain his old form, beats Brooklyn 1-0
on Gabby Hartnett's HR. The Cubs sweep, winning the 2nd game, 9-1.

1940
Joe Medwick, in the Dodger lineup for 6 days after his trade from the
Cardinals, is beaned by St. Louis P Bob Bowman at Ebbets Field in the
2nd game of a doubleheader. Allegedly, Medwick had been tipped off by 3B
coach Chuck Dressen, who had stolen the sign, to expect a curve. The Cards
win their 6th straight in 11 innings, 7-5, as Bowman is escorted from the
park by policemen. Hospitalized, Medwick will return to the lineup after
several days, but he is never again a major power hitter. Larry MacPhail

record by scoring 14 runs in the opening frame of the 2nd game. The output

enroute to a 21-2 trouncing. Hegan piles on with a grand slam in the 3rd
inning, off Carl Scheib.

14 hits and 6 walks, 20 runners in succession, before 3B George Kell flies
out to end it. Steve Gromek, making his first appearance for Detroit, Dick
Weik and Earl Harrist are the offending Tiger pitchers, but the loss goes
to Ned Garver, who exits before the 7th. Ellis Kinder picks up the win,
and contributes two singles and 2 RBIs in the big inning, the second time
that Kinder has accomplished this ... he was hitless last year. Dick Gernert
and Walt Dropo hit the only homers for Boston, but the Red Sox set a slew of
records, including the following ... in an inning: most hits (14); most runs
(17); most batters reaching 1B (20) ... tied the ML record for an inning:
most batters facing a pitcher (23); most batters facing a pitcher 3 times
(5); most batters reaching 1B three times (3); most singles (11); most runs
in an inning (3, by Sammy White).

The Giants, a big favorite to win the pennant in a preseason poll of writers
taken by The Sporting News, change managers, replacing Bill Rigney with

By a 5-3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court confirms lower court rulings in the
Curt Flood case, upholding baseball's exemption from antitrust laws and
the legitimacy of its reserve clause. Its decision is narrowly construed,

to undercut the reserve system. By the year's end the ML owners will destroy
it themselves by agreeing to salary arbitration.

Mike LaCoss, and then is lifted an inning later. The Giants win 6-3. For
Stoddard, his first homer comes in his last major league at-bat. He'll
appear in another 128 games but never swing a bat.

1987
With his club in 5th place in the NL East, Phillies manager John Felske is

Dykstra, P Roger McDowell and another player to be named later (minor league
pitcher Tom Edens).

1991
Former Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky, 35, has his left arm amputated to
alleviate chronic infection and nerve damage. The operation is done at New
York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. Dravecky has had three operations
on the arm to remove cancerous tumors. He won a game 10 months after his first
operation, when doctors removed 50% of the major pitching muscle in his arm.

Andujar Cedeno and Brad Ausmus for John Flaherty and Chris Gomez.

Cub 1B Brant Brown, recalled 3 days ago to fill in for Mark Grace, slugs
three homers in 4 at-bats in a doubleheader against the Dodgers. It's

split the two games, losing the opener, 9-6, before winning the nightcap, 7-4.

Montreal defeats Colorado, 12-8, with the help of 2 HRs and 7 runs batted
in by 2B Mike Lansing. His grand slam in the 8th proves to be the decisive
blow, breaking a 7-7 tie.

The Yanks manage just 3 hits off Brad Radke, but one is a 2-run HR by Tino
Martinez, as the Yanks beat Minnesota, 2-0. Radke had retired the first 20
batters. Kenny Rogers pitches 8 shutout innings for the win.

1997
At a packed Yankee Stadium, the Yankees edge the Mets, 3-2, on a 10th-inning
RBI single by Tino Martinez. Solo homeruns by Chad Curtis and Cecil Fielder
off Rick Reed gives the Yankees their lead and Yankee starter David Cone
dominates his former team and does not allow a hit until John Olerud's
leadoff double in the seventh. The three games at Yankee Stadium draw 168,719.

by having 4 sons of former major leaguers in the lineups: Ken Griffey Jr,
Jose Cruz Jr, Barry Bonds and Stan Javier.

The Reds, behind journeyman Mike Remlinger, trip the Indians, 5-2. Remlinger,
acquired on waivers in April, shuts out Cleveland on two hits through six
innings and gives state bragging rights to the Reds. The historic three-game
series draws 128,727.

In the fog in Toronto, Carlos Delgado hits a 3-run HR to give the Jays
a 5-3 win over the Braves. There is a 14-minute fog delay in the fourth
inning as the game is interrupted while the retractable roof at SkyDome is
closed. The fog then dissipates.

Wilson Alvarez fires the White Sox to a 3-0 win over the Cubs to give them
the Windy City series, 2-1. Alvarez pitches a four-hitter for his first
shutout in more than three years. The game draws 44,204 fans, the second
consecutive sellout crowd and second-largest in new Comiskey Park history
to Tuesday's 44,249.

In Kansas City, Jeff King hits his fourth interleague homerun, a grand slam
in the first inning, to lead the Royals to a 6-2 win over the Astros. In

in the game, the first major league matchup of pitchers from Japan.

1998
Cubs OF Brant Brown hits 3 HRs in Chicago's 12-5 victory over the Phillies. He
adds a single and drives home 5 of the Cubs' runs. Exactly 3 years earlier,
on June 18, 1996, Brown hit 3 HRs in a doubleheader against the Dodgers.

Pitcher Dave Stieb is recalled by the Toronto Blue Jays. Stieb, attempting
to make a comeback this year, last pitched in the major leagues for the
White Sox on May 22, 1993. The veteran righthander hurls an inning of
scoreless relief, despite giving up 3 hits, in Toronto's 13-6 win over the
Orioles. Stieb will finish the year at 1-2 and then retire for good.

the cycle by the 4th inning. Lansing has an RBI triple in the 1st, a 2-run
HR in the 2nd, a 2-run double in the 3rd and a single in the 4th as Colorado
stroked a team-record 23 hits. 3B Jeff Cirillo gets 5 hits for the Rockies,
including a HR, while Brent Mayne has 4. The Rocks total 10 extra base hits,
one short of yesterday's total against the D'Backs. The win moves the Rockies
into 1st place in the NL West, percentage points ahead of the Diamondbacks.

The White Sox continue to pummel the Yankees, 17-4, to give them a sweep of
their 4-game series. Chicago scores 9 runs in the 1st inning off El Duque
on the way to its team-record 11th straight road victory. They also set
a little-known ML mark by winning their 10th straight over a team with a
.500 record or better.

The A's tie a team record as they run over the Royals, 21-3, scoring 10
runs in the 3rd inning. The A's scored 21 runs on June 14, 1969 against
Boston. The 18-run difference is also the largest margin of defeat for
the Royals in their history. Every Oakland starter gets at least 1 hit,
1 RBI and 1 run scored. Gil Heredia is an easy winner over Jeff D'Amico,
making his first ML start.

2001
Citing he wants to spend more time with his family, Orioles legend Cal Ripken
Jr announces he will retire at the end of the season. The two-time MVP will
be best remembered for his streak of playing in 2,632 consecutive games.

A mandate issued by the commissioner's office imposes a two-minute limit for
warm-up tosses thrown by relievers who come in during an inning, with the
time starting when the pitcher enters fair territory. At the beginning of a
frame the allotted warm-up time for a hurler will be one-minute forty-seconds
unless the game is on national television, in that event the time limit
will be increased by 20 seconds.

Well, it's not Wrigley. The Cubs lose their 12th straight in St. Louis as
the Cards beat them 6-2. McGwire and Edmonds match homers with Sosa and
Eric Young. Back home, the Cubs announce plans to renovate Wrigley Field,
adding more than 2,200 seats.

The Diamondbacks roll past the Astros, 14-5, as rookie 2B Junior Spivey
goes 5 for 6 with 3 RBIs and 3 runs scored.

been asking players for a large number of autographs with implicit threats
of retaliation in terms of close calls if they didn't agree.

2002
In the first major league game to feature four players with 400 career homers,
the Cubs beat the Rangers, 4-3, when Alex Gonzalez hits a walk-off homer in

Gonzalez (401) watched Rafael Palmeiro add his 460th home run to the total.

2004
At Shea Stadium, Hall of Fame catchers Carlton Fisk, Johnny Bench, Gary
Carter and Yogi Berra take part in a pre-game ceremony to honor Mike Piazza
for hitting more homeruns as a catcher than anyone in baseball history. The
Mets' backstop established the new mark, breaking Carlton Fisk's record,
with his 352nd homerun on May 5.

This is getting boring. For the third game in a row the Kansas City Royals
win, 10-4, beating the Phillies. They defeated the Braves by the same score
in their previous two games. Matt Stairs has 2 homers and a double and
Angel Berroa is a homer short of the cycle. Former 1st-round pick Chris
George (1-0) goes 6+ innings for the win. Elias Sports Bureau says that
the Royals are the first team to win three straight games by the same score
while scoring at least 10 runs in each.

2005

total, 136 at-bats and 155 plate appearances with the bases full) grand
slam to pace the Yankees to an 8-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Jeter
connects in the 6th inning off Joe Borowksi, then adds a solo shot in the
8th. Jason Dubois' first ML homer, off Chien-Ming Wang, is the only score
for the Cubs. The Yankee shortstop's homer ends the longest such drought
among current major leaguers.

The Homer (Michigan) HS baseball team loses to Saginaw Nouvel in the Michigan
State Division III final. The aptly named Homer team set a high school
record for the longest winning streak two weeks ago with 74 straight wins.

2006
In a game in which veteran hurler Kenny Rogers wins his 200th career victory,
the Tigers go yard eight times to set a club record. Cubs starter Mark
Prior, who recently returned from the 60-day disabled list, gives up three
of the homeruns in the 6-run first inning of the 12-3 barrage at Wrigley
Field. Prior and Roberto Novoa each give up four homeruns.

The Mets defeat the Orioles, 9-4. Baltimore P Adam Loewen takes the loss
in his 4th ML start. The opposing P in each of the 4 games has been a Cy
Young Award winner - Randy Johnson, Roy Halladay (twice) and Tom Glavine.

For the second time this season, Michael Young has five hits to lead the
Rangers to a 10-7 win over the Diamondbacks. Young has a homer and double
and drives in the tie breaking run in the 3-run 8th inning.

Can't take the late nights. Steve Karsay unexpectedly announces his
retirement a night after he earns a win by pitching the last two frames of
the A's 17-inning 5-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Karsay retires
having earned a win in his first and last ML appearances. He defeated the
Milwaukee Brewers in his first major-league game, also for the A's, in 1993.

2007
Trailing the Red Sox by 15 1/2 games in the AL East after playing just

the midst of an O's eight-game losing streak as the club embarks on a West
Coast road trip.

2009
The Boston Red Sox celebrate their 500th consecutive sellout at Fenway
Park. Sox pitcher Brad Penny also gets his 100th career win.

2010
President Obama, along with his two daughters, makes an unannounced trip to
National Park to watch Stephen Strasburg pitch against his favorite team,
the White Sox. The commander-in-chief is on hand to see the 21-year-old
fireballer strike out ten batters to bring the phenom's three-game total
to 32, three more than the rookie record of 29 established by J.R. Richard
in 1971.

2012
R.A. Dickey throws his second consecutive one-hitter when he allows only
a fifth-inning single by Wilson Betemit in the Mets' 5-0 victory over
Baltimore at Citi Field. The 37-year-old knuckleball pitcher, who hasn't
allowed an earned run in 42 2/3 innings, also limited Tampa Bay to a lone
safety in his last start.

After a lengthy ten-week trial, Roger Clemens is acquitted by a jury on
all charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress when he testified at
a deposition during a 2008 nationally televised hearing. The seven-time Cy
Young winner, who won 354 games playing for the Red Sox, Blue Jays, Yankees
and Astros during his 24 years in the major leagues, contended that the
success in the latter part of his career was a result of an over-the-top work
ethic and not due to taking performance-enhancing drugs as widely believed.

With his one-out solo homerun off Shawn Kelley in the seventh in the
Diamondbacks' 7-1 victory over Seattle at Chase Field, Aaron Hill becomes
the fifth player in franchise history to hit for the cycle. The Arizona
second baseman, the first D-Back to single, double, triple and homer in
four at-bats, joins Kelly Johnson (2010), Stephen Drew (2008), Greg Colbrunn
(2002) and Luis Gonzalez (2000) in accomplishing the rare feat.

2014
With the only batter reaching base as a result of a throwing error by
shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the seventh inning, Clayton Kershaw no-hits
the Rockies at Dodger Stadium, striking out a career-high 15 batters. The
left-hander's teammate Josh Beckett also threw a no-hitter 24 days ago,
making it the shortest span between no-hitters by a team since the Reds'
Johnny Vander Meer accomplished it in consecutive starts, four days apart,
in 1938.

2015
Carlos Correa, the number one overall pick in 2012, becomes the
second-youngest player in the modern era to steal three bases in a game
when he swipes a trio of bags in Houston's 8-4 victory against the Rockies
at Coors Field. In 1979, Rickey Henderson was 20 years and 241 days old
when he accomplished the feat, 18 days younger than the Astro shortstop.

2018
Bartolo Colon of Texas, with his victory against the Kansas City Royals,
became the winningest pitcher in Major League history from the Dominican
Republic. His 244th career win passed Hall of Famer Juan Marichal.

In the continuation of a game that started May 15, Juan Soto pinch-hits
a two-run homer that proves to be the difference in the Nationals' 5-3
victory against the Yankees. The stats of the game will indicate the 19
year-old rookie outfielder accomplishment preceded his big league debut,
an oddity that also includes Dave Parker (1973) and Barry Bonds (1986) among
the players who also recorded hits before making their big league debuts.

2019
Cole Hamels recorded his 2,500th career strikeout by fanning Ivan Nova of
the Chicago White Sox. He became the 38th player to reach this mark.
