2-0 lead in the 5th. With a light mist falling, Boston starts stalling,
and then finds an ally when a "horde of fans" (Chicago Tribune) storm the
field from the RF bleachers "where the gambling crowd is allowed to operate
freely." The mob goes on the field in the 5th to prevent the Red Sox from
batting and making it an official game and with just five policemen in the
stadium, the umpires are unable to clear the field. The Chicago players must
force their way to the dugout and "Buck Weaver is "hit by a pop bottle while
leaving the field." Weaver and McMullen are accused of "having slugged a
couple of fans in the mob during the riot, and later those fans went to the
chief officer and arranged to get warrants out for their arrest." Umpire
McCormick refuses to forfeit the game and two mounted policemen come on
the field when the players return. Boston owner Frazee "declined to obey

"pulled his watch." Sawdust is spread on the wet infield and when play
resumes 45 minutes later the White Sox go on to a 7-2 win.

Ring calls time and asks the plate umpire, Cy Pfirman, if he can leave the
field to change into a dry undershirt. Pfirman refuses and catcher Jimmy
Wilson begins arguing with the ump. Wilson then gets tossed and Butch Henline
replaces him at catcher. Henline continues the argument and he, too, gets
thumbed. Phils manager Art Fletcher then takes his turn arguing and Cards
manager Hornsby joins him at the plate. When Fletcher turns on Hornsby,
Rogers decks him, and Pfirman then tosses Hornsby out of the game. Ring,
who managed to change his shirt while the scene was going on, then gives
up 2 runs to the Cards in the 6th, and 4 more in the 7th to lose 6-4. The
Cards sweep the five-game series from Philadelphia. NL Prexy Heydler hands

St. Louis turn a NL-record-tying 7 double plays.

The Red Sox trade C Dave Valle to the Brewers in exchange for OF Tom
Brunansky.

1995
The Cubs acquire 3B Todd Zeile from the Cardinals in exchange for P Mike
Morgan, minor league IF Paul Torres and C Francisco Morales.

The Cardinals fire manager Joe Torre, and replace him on an interim basis
with Mike Jorgensen.

1996
Long-time voice of the Yankees, Mel Allen, dies at age 83.

1997
At Yankee Stadium, the Mets beat their cross-town rivals, 6-0, in the
first-ever regular season game between the two teams. Dave Mlicki throws a
complete game shutout blanking the Bronx Bombers on nine hits. It's Mlicki's
first career complete game and his first career shutout.

In the first regular-season meeting between Ohio's 2 teams, Cincy rookie
Brett Tomko pitches 7 1/3 shutout innings as Cincinnati beats Cleveland,
4-1. The win is costly for the Reds who lose Barry Larkin when he ruptures
his heel running out a double.

At Comiskey Park, the lowly Cubs earn bragging rights in the Windy City,
beating the White Sox, 8-3. The Cubbies tally 14 hits in the first official
game between the two rivals since the 1906 World Series. Both teams wear
replicas of old-fashioned uniforms ... the Cubs in their 1908 outfits,
the White Sox in replica 1917 garb. Evanston native Kevin Foster records
the win, allowing seven hits and three runs in six innings.

At Milwaukee, Jeremy Burnitz hits a game-ending HR in the 9th off Alan
Benes to give the Brewers a 1-0 win over the Cardinals.

The Twins lose their first game to a NL team in the Metrodome as the Pirates
win, 8-6. The Twins swept eight home games from St. Louis (1987) and Atlanta
(1991) in their two World Series championships. Bucs' DH Mark Smith homers
and Kevin Polcovich adds his first ML homer

At Baltimore, the Expos tie a club record with their 10th straight win,
beating the Orioles, 6-4.

1998
The Phillies trail the Pirates, 7-1, heading into the bottom of the 9th. They
fight back against relievers Ricardo Rincon and Rich Loiselle, however, to
score 7 runs in their half of the frame for an 8-7 victory. Mike Lieberthal's
two-out three-run blast off Loiselle is the final blow that sinks the Bucs.

Orioles Sidney Ponson and Arthur Rhodes combine on a 2-hit 2-0 shutout over
the Yankees. The win, the 2nd in the 3 game series with New York, ends the
Yankees' ML record streak of 24 straight winning series. The skein started
after the Yankees opened with 2 losses at Anaheim.

2001
In a game that features thousands of swarming moths, Boston beats the
Braves and the bugs in extra innings at Turner Field, 9-5. Although the
insects have little bearing on the outcome of the game, the insects clearly
bothered some players, including Dave Martinez who claimed to having sucked
one into his mouth.

Brad Penny (7 innings) and Rickey Bones (2 innings) combine to shut out
the Devil Rays, 11-0, on 1 hit. C Ray Flaherty's single is the only Tampa
Bay safety.

The Mariners trip the Padres, 9-2, as Seattle 1B John Olerud hits for the
cycle. It is the 2nd time in his career that Olerud has cycled even though
he has hit just 12 triples in his 13-year career, by far the fewest number
of triples by a player with more than one cycle. Wally Westlake is 2nd on
the list with 33. Twenty-one players in all have hit for the cycle more
than once in their career.

The Blue Jays recall veteran Tony Fernandez, signed a week ago to a minor
league contract with Syracuse after the Brewers released him on May 30. Tony
hits a 6th inning pinch single. For Fernandez, it is his 4th tour of duty
with the Jays making him just the second player since Bobo Newsom to make 4
tours of duty with one team. Bobo made 5 separate appearances for the old
Senators, the last in 1952. The other player is Rickey Henderson, who has
done 4 tours of duty with the A's.

Miami defeats Stanford, 12-1, to win the College World Series. It is the
Hurricanes' 4th national title. Miami's Charlton Jimerson, a 5th round
draft pick of the Astros, is named the CWS Most Outstanding Player.

2002
Barry Zito wins his 8th straight game as Oakland beats their rivals, the
SF Giants, 2-1. The win gives the A's a 58-37 record against the National
League, the best interleague record of any team. The A's will finish the
season 16-2 against the NL.

The Red Sox, behind Derek Lowe, defeat the Atlanta Braves, 6-1. Lowe strikes
out 10 to pin the loss on Tom Glavine. For the Braves, it is one of their
few losses to AL foes. They will go 15-3 in interleague games this year.

Mo Vaughn belts a 3-run HR in the bottom of the 8th off David Wells to
give the Mets a 3-2 win over the Yankees. Mark Guthrie, in relief of Pedro
Astacio, picks up the win. In the 5th, Piazza throws out Alfonzo Soriano,
ending a streak of 51 successful runners against Mike, not counting a 1-3-6
throwout on April 16.

2003
The Marlins squeak by the Mets, 1-0, as rookie Dontrelle Willis hurls a
1-hitter. Ty Wigginton's 4th inning single is NY's only hit as Willis hurls
the first complete game of his career in his 8th big league start. Ivan
Rodriguez' HR accounts for the only run of the contest.

2004
Florida's Carl Pavano allows just 3 hits and walks no one as the Marlins
trip the White Sox, 4-0. Mike Lowell's 16th HR is all the scoring Pavano
needs. Carlos Lee of the Sox has his 28-game hit streak stopped, but the
outfielder does break the team record shared by Luke Appling and Albert Belle.

2005
After a pitch goes between his legs, Richmond Braves flycatcher Esix Snead
charges the mound and pummels the Syracuse SkyChiefs hurler, David Bush. The
action incites an International League brawl which will result in 40 players,
a coach and a manager being fined and/or suspended, including a ten-day
hiatus for Snead.

The White Sox score 10 runs in the 6th inning on their way to a 12-6
come-from-behind victory over the Diamondbacks.

2006
For first time 35 years, the Yankees play a regular season game in the
nation's capital beating the Nationals in an interleague contest at RFK
Stadium, 7-5. The Bronx Bombers' previous game in Washington, played in the
same ball park on September 30, 1971, ended with New York being awarded a
9-0 victory when Senators fans, as a protest to losing another franchise
for the second time since 1961, refuse to leave the field with their team
ahead by two runs in the season finale.

In the sixth inning of a 9-8 loss to Lynx in Ottawa, Brandon Watson of
the Columbus Clippers breaks the 95-year-old International League record
by extending his hitting streak to 43 consecutive games. The Nationals'
farmhand, who is batting .360 during this stretch, eclipses the mark set
by Jack Lelivelt of the Rochester Hustlers in 1912.

2008
In his fifth season with Seattle, Bill Bavasi is fired as the general manager
of the team with the worst record in the major leagues (24-45). Two weeks
ago, in a move he comes to regret, the embattled GM locked the clubhouse
doors and mandates the Mariners players to sit together and be publicly
held accountable for their slow sart.

2010
Michael Young's two-run single in the eighth inning not only contributes to
the Rangers' 6-3 victory over Florida, but also establishes a club record
for hits. The 33-year-old third baseman surpasses Ivan Rodriguez' club
record with his 1,748th hit, reaching the mark in 91 less games than Pudge.

2014
Tony Gwynn, surrounded by his family at Pomerado Hospital in Poway, CA,
loses his battle to salivary gland cancer at the age of 54. The Hall of
Fame outfielder, who became the head baseball coach for San Diego State
University after spending his entire major league career with the Padres,
compiled a .338 career batting average over 20 seasons, collecting 3,141 hits,
enroute to tying Honus Wagner's mark of eight National League batting titles.
"Major League Baseball today mourns the tragic loss of Tony Gwynn, the
greatest Padre ever and one of the most accomplished hitters that our game
has ever known, whose all-around excellence on the field was surpassed by
his exuberant personality and genial disposition in life." - Commissioner
Bud Selig, on the passing of Tony Gwynn.

2019
Charlie Blackmon set the Major League record for most hits in a four-game
series by getting 15 hits against the San Diego Padres (June 13 to June
16). He broke the record that was set by Buck Jordan of the Boston Braves
in 1934 and Bill White of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1961.
