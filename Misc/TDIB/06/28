3-0 win in the nitecap. Jack Powell takes the loss.

1907
The last place Washington Senators steal a record 13 bases off C Branch
Rickey in a 16-5 win over New York. Rickey, acquired last February from the
Browns, is pressed into service despite a bad shoulder because of the injury
to starter Red Kleinow. Rickey's first throw to 2B ends up in right field and
the subsequent tosses are not much better. He almost nips Jim Delahanty on a
steal of 3B. In his 8 innings, relief pitcher Lew Brockett helps Washington
with a deliberate windup, nine walks and allowing 15 hits. Only pitcher
Tom Hughes and 2B Nig Perrine are steal-less, while Hal Chase swipes one
for New York. Although not a terrific player, Rickey, 'the Mahatma', will
become one of the premier baseball administrators in the history of the game.

game-ender, to beat the Athletics, 4-3.

in a game. Mordecai Brown is the winner. Chicago will swipe home plate 17
times this year to establish the ML mark, which will be tied next year by the
Giants in the NL. The Yankees will steal home 18 times in 1912 to set the ML
mark. The 2 steals of home in one game will be repeated next by Larry Doyle.

Josh Devore.

1911

were untouched, but the new double-decker seats another 16,000. Only 6,000
fans show up for the inauguration as Mathewson shuts out the Rustlers, 3-0,
on 9 hits. While guests at the Highlanders Hilltop Park, the Giants won 21
of 29 games.

1912
The New York Giants sweep another two from the Braves, winning 10-3 and 12-3,
to run their winning streak to 11 games. Christy Mathewson wins the opener,
adding a steal of home on the front end of a double steal in the 4th inning
when Braves catcher Bill Rariden's throw goes into CF. It is one of 13 bases
manager John McGraw's Giants swipe on the afternoon against Rariden, who
caught the first game, and teammate Johnny Kling, who squatted behind the
plate for game two. This is the 2nd time in a month that a Giants pitcher
has stolen home ... Red Ames did it May 22 against Brooklyn. The Giants
will steal home 17 times this year to tie the NL mark set by Chicago last
season. However, Kling does tie a mark in the 5th inning of the second game
by throwing out 3 Giant baserunners (Beals Becker, Dave Robertson and Art

homer in the 4th by Sherry Magee. Jeff Tesreau is the winner in the nitecap.

whip the Phils, 18-3. Bancroft ties the mark of six singles in a regulation
game, and no National Leaguer will match it this century. Despite the hits,
the game is completed in 1 hour 58 minutes. Frisch, Kelly and George Burns
have homers, and Burns will hit another tomorrow.

The A's snap their losing streak of 18 games, defeating the Senators, 6-2,
behind Harris. Seeking help, the A's sign Harvard 1B Jeff Jones, who will
report tomorrow.

1922

reason. Cleveland still wins, 6-5, over the visiting White Sox.

1936
Larry French and Bill Lee pitch the Cubs to twin shutouts, 3-0 and 6-0,
over the Giants and replace the Cardinals in the league lead.

1939
In Philadelphia, the Yankees hit 8 HRs (Dahlgren (2), DiMaggio (2), Dickey,
Gordon, Henrich, Selkirk) in the first game of a doubleheader with the A's,
and 5 more in the nightcap. Both are ML records, as are the 87 total bases
and 98 at-bats in a doubleheader. In the 7th inning, the Yanks belt 3 homers
with 2 outs tying a ML mark; they are the 3rd major league team to accomplish
that feat this month. Joe DiMaggio, Babe Dahlgren and Joe Gordon each hit
3 HRs for the afternoon as the Yankees win the opener 23-2. Monty Pearson
wins the laugher. New York then bangs out 16 hits and takes the nightcap,
10-0, behind Lefty Gomez' 3-hitter. Gomez contributes 2 hits himself. Facing
just 5 pitchers in the twin bill, the Yankees finish off the A's in 2 hours
27 minutes in the opener, and take 1 hour 40 minutes in the 2nd game. The
A's have no four-baggers on the day.

White Sox rookie Don Kolloway does it all. He steals 4 bases, including a
record-tying 2nd, 3rd and home in the 9th, and hits 2 HRs and a single in

Players act as umpires after Casey Stengel receives a telegram from umpire
Babe Pinelli that the other two umps, Al Barlick and Lee Ballanfant, are
fogbound on a nightboat from New York. Stengel picks Johnny Cooney to ump
behind the plate while manager Leo Durocher picks Freddy Fitzsimmons. There
are no beefs in the first inning, though Boston plates one run, and when
the regularly assigned umpires finally run on the field just before the
second inning, the fans greet them with foghorn imitations. Boston wins, 3-2.

DiMaggio has two hits and a walk off Johnny Babich of the A's, to extend
his hitting streak to 40 games, second longest in the AL. New York wins,

CF with a man on in the 4th.

record set by George Kelly in 1924. Cooper had 2 HRs in the first game of
the streak, and his shot today helps his brother Mort win, 14-6, over the
Phils, his first win as a Giant. Al Jurisich goes all the way for the Phils,
prompting a protest by Horace Stoneham. Phils manager Ben Chapman counters
that he had no other pitchers available because of injuries and tomorrow's
twinbill. It'll be Schoolboy Rowe's turn to take one for the team when the
Phils vet gives up 14 hits in a 9-inning loss to Brooklyn on the 30th.

Yale. Cal freshman P Jackie Jensen, who will later star in the majors,

run and makes 17 putouts with no errors.

Red Sox, 6-4, in a night game at Fenway before 36,228, the largest night
crowd in Fenway history. Hank Bauer's 3-run homer in the 2nd inning off

the Cards, winning 8-0. Enos Slaughter has a 5th-inning single but is erased

damper on even a Yankee win."

1979
The Pirates trade pitchers Ed Whitson, Al Holland and Fred Breining
to the Giants for P Dave Roberts and infielders Bill Madlock and Lenny

to be built in the future as teams try to copy the "retro" look done so
successfully by the HOK architectural firm.

but will come in when Bill Haselman breaks his finger.

Yankees P David Wells starts the game against Cleveland wearing Babe Ruth's
autographed cap from the 1934 season. Manager Joe Torre makes him take it
off after the 1st inning since it doesn't conform to the team's current
uniform. Without the cap, Wells blows a 3-0 lead as the Indians go on to
a 12-8 victory. The Indians mount a 19-hit attack, as CF Marquis Grissom
accounts for 5 of the hits, while 3B Matt Williams gets 4 hits, including
a pair of homers, and drives home 6 runs.

44-MPH lob. McGwire grounds out in the 1st inning swinging at a lob, and
then with a 0-2 count in the 4th, pops out to first on another. Tewksbury
also retires Ray Lankford in the 6th on a lob and ends with a 3-2 win.

Sammy Sosa has two singles and an RBI - but no homers - as the Cubs snap
a seven game losing streak with a 6-3 win over the Royals.

1999
Hack Wilson ups his RBI total for the 1930 season to 191. 69 years after the
season, an RBI is added by the commissioner's office, which also gives Babe
Ruth six additional walks, raising his career-record total to 2,062. "There is
no doubt that Hack Wilson's RBI total should be 191," commissioner Bud Selig
said. "I am sensitive to the historical significance that accompanies the
correction of such a prestigious record, especially after so many years have
passed, but it is important to get it right." The missing RBI came from the
2nd game of a doubleheader between Wilson's Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati
Reds on July 28, 1930 when Charlie Grimm was credited with 2 RBIs in the
game and Wilson with none. Ruth's walks total is now 2,062. Ted Williams is
second, trailing by 43, and Rickey Henderson of the New York Mets is third,
134 behind Ruth.

The San Diego Padres edge the visiting Colorado Rockies, 8-7, as Padres
shortstop Damian Jackson steals five bases, including home.

2000
The Rockies overcome a 7-run deficit to defeat the visiting Giants, 17-13,
as 3B Jeff Cirillo slugs a double and 3 HRs, drives home 6 runs, and scores
5 himself. Cirillo's 3rd homer, a 2-run shot off John Johnstone, breaks a
12-12 tie. The Rockies draw their 20 millionth fan to one ballpark faster
than any other team in major league history. Taking less than six years,
Colorado eclipses the Dodgers' mark of taking nine years in two stadiums
to reach the milestone.

The Orioles nip the Red Sox, 8-7, in 11 innings, as B.J. Surhoff goes 5
for 6 for Baltimore, stretching his hitting streak to 21 games.

2001
After 20 seasons in San Diego, Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn announces he'll
retire at the end of the season. The future Hall of Famer has the highest
lifetime batting average (.338) among all active players.

The Reds defeat the Cubs, 5-2, as OF Alex Ochoa gets 5 hits, including a HR,
for Cincinnati. OF Dmitri Young adds 4 hits.

2002
In a steal, the Expos obtain pitchers Bartolo Colon and Tim Drew from the
Indians in exchange for 1B Lee Stevens, P Cliff Lee, OF Grady Sizemore and
SS Brandon Phillips.

Tampa Bay whips their cross state rival Marlins, 4-0, behind Wilson Alvarez
and 2 relievers. Jared Sandberg homers for TB. In the 7th, Kevin Millar of
the Marlins hits a towering fly that lands on one of the catwalks that hang
from the stadium's dome. It never comes down and it is ruled a double. It's
the second time a ball has gotten stuck in a catwalk at the Trop. In 1999,
Jose Canseco hit a homerun drive that lodged there. Millar joins Ruppert
Jones, Rickey Nelson, Dave Kingman, Alvaro Espinoza and Canseco as the only
players to hit a fair ball that got stuck in a stadium obstruction. Jones
and Nelson both had hits get caught in the overhead speakers at the old
Kingdome. The balls hit by Kingman and Espinoza were at the Minneapolis
Metrodome with Kingman's getting stuck in a drainage valve and Espinoza's
lodging in an overhead speaker.

2003
A day after a 25-8 whipping by the Bosox, the Marlins stage their biggest
comeback in team history. Trailing 9-2 in the 8th inning against starter
Tim Wakefield, the Marlins score 4 runs in the 8th and 4 runs in the 9th
to win, 10-9.

Barry Bonds, who splashed #634 into the Bay last night, hits #635 today as
the Giants edge the A's, 8-7, in 10 innings. San Francisco wins on Pedro
Feliz' single in the 10th.

After winning yesterday on Jose Valentin's HR in the 9th, the White Sox
beat the Cubs again in the 9th, winning 7-6 before a crowd of 45,440.

The Cardinals batter the Royals, 13-9, as Jim Edmonds has 4 extra base hits,
including 2 homers. This is his 2nd four extra-base-hit game this year,
tying a ML record. Rookie Bo Hart has 4 hits and scores 4 runs for his 7th
multi-hit game in 9 outings. He is hitting .489.

Led by Hideki Matsui the Yankees sweep a day-night doubleheader from the
crosstown Mets, winning the 1st by a score of 7-1 at Yankee Stadium and
the nightcap, 9-8, at Shea Stadium. It is the 3rd time in history that two
teams play two games at two different stadiums in the same day. Matsui
has a grand slam in game 1 as Roger Clemens shuts down the Mets. Matsui
has 4 hits in game 2 as he is on base 9 out of 10 plate appearances. For
the second time this season, Alfonse Soriano leads off with a homer and a
teammate follows with a HR. This time it is Jeter who follows suit.

2004
The Phils down the Expos, 14-6, as 3B David Bell hits for the cycle. Bell
doubles in the 2nd inning, homers in the 4th, singles in the 6th and triples
in the 7th. His grandfather, Gus, also hit for the cycle for Pittsburgh
in 1951. They are only grandson and grandfather combination to accomplish
the feat.

The Brewers shut out the Angels, 1-0, in 17 innings on Scott Posednik's
2-out double. Ben Sheets retires the first 20 batters he faces before losing
his perfect game in the 7th inning on Vladimir Guerrero's single. It is
the only hit Sheets surrenders in 9 innings of work. The Brewers tie a ML
record by striking out 26 times in the contest. Geoff Jenkins fans 6 times,
also tying a record.

2005
Travis Hafner has 3 hits, including the go-ahead grand slam in the top of
the 9th, to power the Indians to a 12-8 win over Boston. Hafner drives in
6 runs. Grady Sizemore scores 4 runs for the Tribe on no hits.

2006
Losing to the White Sox, 4-3, the Pirates set a team record with their 13th
consecutive defeat. The 1939 Bucs had held the dubious mark losing 12 in
row during their 68-85 sixth place finish in the National League.

With his worst outing in the two seasons with the Mets, Pedro Martinez is
routed by his former teammates in his return to Fenway as the BoSox maul
the Mets, 10-2. The crowd, who chanted "Pedro! Pedro!" before the game,
showed their appreciation of the Dominican's history as a Red Sox player
with a standing ovation during yesterday's video tribute which highlighted
the right-hander's achievements with Boston.

2007
Frank Thomas hits a three-run homer off Twins hurler Carlos Silva in the
first inning of the Blue Jays' 8-5 loss at the Metrodome to become the
21st major leaguer to hit 500 homeruns. The 'Big Hurt', who has hit 50
homers (10%) against the Twins, also hit his first homerun of his career
in Minnesota in 1990.

With the third of his five hits in the Astros' 8-5 11-inning victory over
the Colorado at Minute Maid Park, Craig Biggio collects his 3000th hit to
become the 27th major leaguer to reach the plateau, and the ninth player
to do it with the same team. The milestone is reached in the seventh inning
with a single off Aaron Cook, but the Houston second baseman is thrown out
trying to stretch the historic hit into a double. The 41-year-old finishes
the game 5 for 6 with an RBI and a run scored.

2008
In Chavez Ravine, the Dodgers, without the benefit of a hit for the entire
game, defeat the Angels, 1-0. The combined losing effort of Halos hurlers
Jered Weaver and Jose Arredondo isn't considered officially as a no-hitter
because the home team didn't have to bat in the ninth. It's the fifth game
in the majors since 1900 in which the winning team did not record a hit,
and the first since Boston's Matt Young lost one in 1992.

2009
Mariano Rivera joins Trevor Hoffman in becoming only the second pitcher to
record 500 major league saves. The right-handed reliever, who also registered
his first RBI of his 15-year career (with a bases-loaded walk in the 9th),
reached the milestone by getting the last four outs in the Yankees' 4-2 win
over the Mets at Citi Field completing a Subway Series sweep. Today was the
39-year-old closer's third regular-season plate appearance, and second in
five days.

2010
In a scene reminiscent of Dave Dravecky breaking his arm in 1989 as a result
of throwing a ball to a batter, Tiger reliever Joel Zumaya crumbles to his
knees in extreme pain after releasing a pitch in a game against Minnesota
at Target Field. The hard-throwing right-hander will miss the remainder
of the season, but because there is no ligament damage to his elbow, the
prognosis for next season is optimistic.

The Cubs place Carlos Zambrano on the restricted list after the right-hander
is suspended for three games for his recent dugout tirade when he had
to be separated from teammate Derrek Lee in the visitors' dugout after
surrendering four runs to the White Sox in the bottom of the first inning
at U.S. Cellular Field. The excitable hurler is scheduled be evaluated by
doctors mutually selected by Major League Baseball and the players' union.

The Cubs honor Ron Santo for his 50 years in baseball. The former third
baseman and current WGN radio analyst receives a white flag with "Santo
50" printed in the team's colors that is autographed by the players,
a photo of the Wrigley Field marquee with the message, "Thank you Ron
for 50 great years", and the seventy-year-old will also throw out the
ceremonial first pitch as well as sing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game"
during the seventh-inning stretch.

2011
After playing 299 games without a grand slam, the Mets hit two bases-full
homers in the span of seven at-bats during their 14-3 rout of Detroit
at Comerica Park. Jason Bay breaks the nearly two-year drought with a
fourth-inning round-tripper, and Carlos Beltran goes deep six batters later
in the fifth frame. Both homers are off Daniel Schlereth.

2012
Madison Bumgarner pitched a 5-0 one-hitter, allowing only Ryan Hanigan's
solid single leading off the sixth inning, as San Francisco threw its
franchise-record fourth straight shutout. Bumgarner struck out eight and
walked two.

2014
Cleveland's Josh Tomlin allowed one hit to Seattle and struck out a
career-high 11 in handing the Mariners a 5-0 loss. Tomlin didn't walk a
batter and a leadoff single by Kyle Seager in the fifth inning was the only
blemish on his evening.

2015
Steven Matz, who goes 3 for 3 at the plate, becomes the first pitcher to
drive in four runs in his major league debut, delivering a two-run double
in his first at-bat and then driving in another pair with a sixth-inning
single. The Mets 24-year-old rookie right-hander from Stony Brook, NY,
gives up five hits and two runs in 7 2/3 innings enroute to earning his
first victory when the Mets beat Cincinnati at Citi Field, 7-2.
