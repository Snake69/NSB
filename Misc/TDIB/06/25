Brodie with a hidden ball trick.

1903
At South End Grounds, Boston Beaneater Wiley Piatt becomes the only
20th-century pitcher to lose two complete games in one day, falling to

12. Pirate player-manager Fred Clarke takes a pitch in the stomach, and will
take a couple more hits tomorrow. Pittsburgh now leads the NL by 2 1/2 games.

next two games to retake first place from Boston.

1919
The Senators and Red Sox split a twinbill, with the Nats pummeling
starter Babe Ruth in the opener, 8-3, and collecting 9 hits and 5 walks
off Babe. For the Nats, Clyde Milan collects 3 hits and Sam Rice cracks a
HR, the only Hall of Famer to go deep on the Babe. Walter Johnson allows
5 hits in the nitecap but takes a 1-0 loss. Ruth plays LF in the 2nd game
and has a single. After the twinbill, Ruth issues an ultimatum to Barrow:
pitch me or play me but don't do both. Barrow will give him tomorrow off.

1924
Pittsburgh relief hurler Emil Yde doubles in the 9th inning against Chicago
to tie the game, then triples in the 14th to win it, 8-7. Pete Alexander
takes the loss, his first in 9 decisions, struggling to the end after being

Philadelphia to tie the ML mark. The Giants sweep, 12-4 and 8-2.

Bob Sanguinett of Midland (West Texas L) hits a homer to start a streak
of homering in 10 straight games, a minor league record that will not
be matched in the century. Mike Calise of Louisville (AA) will come the
closest, hitting homers in 8 straight games in 1982. Sanguinett will break
the record of 7 straight games, held jointly by Richmond (Blue Grass League)
teammates Norman Nunn and Louis Munn, who did it in 1912.

Mud Hens, debuts with 4 walks in the opener and no official at-bats. He's
2 for 5 in the nitecap.

In a PCL game against San Francisco, Missions third baseman Bucky Walters
bangs out 5 doubles. He's rewarded the following July 2 when the Boston
Red Sox of the American League purchase his contract. Walters will switch
to pitching and win 198 in the ML, mostly for the Cincinnati Reds.

1934
Johnny Broaca, Yankee P, ties a major league record by fanning 5 times in a
row while beating the White Sox 13-2. Not until Bernie Williams, on August 21,
1991, will another Yankee fan 5 times (by Bret Saberhagen). Gehrig hits for
the cycle for the first time in his career, and the Yankees regain first
place from the Tigers, losers 13-11 in Philadelphia.

The Reds waive Dazzy Vance to the Cards.

1935

since the Sox acquired him from Washington.

Cubs switch-hitter Augie Galan becomes the first NL player to hit HRs from
both sides of the plate in the same game as Chicago, behind Tex Carleton,
beats Brooklyn, 11-2. Galan hits the first HR batting lefty off Fat Freddie
Fitzsimmons and the 2nd off Ralph Birkofer, with Billy Jurges on board

in 1963 and 1964, will be the only other Cub to accomplish the feat.

1938

for consecutive wins (19), last pitched in 1928.

1944
At Forbes Field, the Cards nose out the Pirates, 2-1. Red Munger (9-1) gets
the win. They then play a 5-5 tie called after 9 innings because of the Blue
Law. The Pirates score 3 in the 9th on a pinch homer by Virgil Davis that
goes through the screen in front of the RF stands. Cards manager Southworth
protests on the basis that the ground rules state that a fair ball sticking in

features 9 homeruns, one short of the record set on August 16, 1947:  Kiner
and Hodges - 2 each, Westlake, Stevens, Restelli, Robinson and Furillo. The
win moves the Dodgers back into first place, as the Cards lose.

features Lisa Kirk, star of Kiss Me Kate.

1952
White Sox SS Chico Carrasquel fractures his little finger in a 10-inning
Sox loss, which drops Chicago 4 games out of 1st place. He'll reinjure it
July 9 and be out of the lineup till August 19. The injury to Carrasquel,
the starting SS in the All-Star game in 1951, 1953 and 1954, is key as the
Sox will finish in 3rd.

in the 8th inning, just the 2nd player ever in organized ball to accomplish

Odom and the Angels beat KC, 4-3.

Heavyweight contender Joe Frazier wants to hold a clinic to teach baseball
players how to fight. "All they do is hurt themselves instead of the other
guy," he said from his training camp. "Look at Joe Pepitone. He banged
up his hands without getting a punch across. Baseball players should know
about combinations as well as double plays." Frazier said he would hold a
clinic on a day when the Yankees are off.

1968
San Francisco rookie Bobby Bonds becomes the 2nd player to debut with a grand
slam, as Ray Sadecki blanks the Dodgers, 9-0. The 22-year-old outfielder
