1902
Cleveland plays its 3rd straight Sunday game in a minor league park, this time
in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Cleveland beats Washington, 6-4, behind Addie Joss.

At Chicago, the locals tie the first place Pirates with a run on a hit and 2
errors in the 9th, then the two teams battle 19 innings before Chicago wins,
3-2. Kling singles and, 2 outs later, scores on Bobby Lowe's single. Both
pitchers hurl the entire game:  Jack Taylor for Chicago and Deacon Phillippe
for Pittsburgh.

At Cincinnati, rookie Henry Thielman wins his 5th straight game, 7-2,
beating the Cardinals battery of the O'Neill brothers:  pitcher Joyce, as
listed in the boxscore, and catcher Jack. It is the first loss in almost a
month for the O'Neill battery (according to the New York Times). Thielman
was acquired earlier in the year from the New York Giants and, despite his
modest winning streak, he'll finish the year at 8-15.

1903
At the Polo Grounds, a crowd of 19,000 is on hand for the twinbill with
Chicago. Iron Joe McGinnity wins the opener, 5-4, in 10 innings, over Jack
Taylor. But Chicago takes the nitecap, scoring 6 runs against Mathewson in
the 9th inning to enable Jock Menefee to pick up a win, 10-6. Matty gives
up 13 hits and 10 runs in losing his 4th game of the year.

In St. Louis, Highlander manager Griffith suspends catcher Jack O'Connor
for insubordination. O'Connor, a St. Louis native, missed the first game
of yesterday's doubleheader and was on hand for the 2nd game but refused
to catch saying he wasn't in shape.

1907
At New York, the Beaneaters blow Mathewson out of the game after 4 innings
with 10 runs on 8 hits. But the Giants claw back to win 11-10 in 12 innings.

1908
Honus Wagner gets hit No. 2,000 in the 8th against Jake Weimer of the Reds,
who wins 4-0 over the Pirates. Wagner makes an error when he is struck on the
finger in the 1st inning. For the Reds, it is their 4th shutout in 5 games.

The Phils lose 1-0 at Brooklyn. Nap Rucker shuts out the Quakers, the 4th
whitewash in 5 games for the Phillies.

1909
The Detroit club buys the rest of the vacant Bennett Field grounds as the
site for a new park.

The National League postpones its games for today because of the funeral
of George Dovey, co-owner of the Boston Nationals with his brother
John. Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss is one of the honorary pall bearers
for the funeral in Philadelphia.

Christy Mathewson pitches 4 innings for the Bucknell alumni against the
varsity, as the undergrads win, 13-12. Matty also plays 3B and chips in
with 3 hits.

1910
Congressman John K. Tener, former Chicago White Stockings and Pittsburgh
Burghers (PL) pitcher, wins the Republican nomination for governor of
Pennsylvania. The Irish-born Tener will be elected and will serve as
president of the NL while governor.

1912
Ty Cobb gets pinched hit for. With two outs in the 9th, and the Tigers down
11-3, Cobb is nowhere to be found, and George Mullin substitutes and flies
out to end the game. It turns out Cobb is in the clubhouse showering.

They might be the Braves this year, but they're still the doormats of
the NL. The Giants fatten their averages today, beating Boston, 17-5 and
14-12. New York puts the opener away for Mathewson with 10 runs in the 7th
inning, with Walt Dickson taking the loss.

The Red Sox beat the Yanks, 10-3, to complete a five-game sweep. Boston
scores 55 runs in the sweeping.

Chicago drubs the Cardinals, 10-2, behind Heinie Zimmerman's 5 RBIs. The
Great Zim has a single, two doubles and a triple.

1913
George Pearce of the Cubs stops the Cards on one hit, a single by Ed
Konetchy. Pearce wins, 6-0, over Pol Perritt.

White Sox pitcher Jim Scott strikes out 6 consecutive batters in a 6-4
win over the Senators. It is the 2nd time this season that 6 straight Nats
hitters have gone down on strikes.

1914
The Giants shade the Reds, 3-2, scoring the winning run in the bottom
of the 9th off Red Ames. Christy Mathewson gives up 7 hits and no walks
as the Giants increase their lead over the NL to 4 games. For the second
year in a row, Matty will end the season with fewer walks than victories,
the only pitcher ever to accomplish that.

1915
Pete Alexander allows 2 hits in the 1st inning and none in the next 8 innings,
but the matchup with the Giants' Rube Marquard ends in a 1-1 tie.

1916
Brownie 1B George Sisler makes his final mound appearance of the year,
a complete-game 2-0 loss to White Sox starter Reb Russell.

Babe Ruth almost duplicates teammate Rube Foster's no-hitter, allowing just
3 singles, two by Frank Gilhooley, in beating the Yankees, 1-0. The game
takes 1 hour 18 minutes.

Against the Giants, the Braves pull off a triple steal in the 11th inning,
with Johnny Evers on the front end of Collins and Compton to win, 3-1. It
is the NL's only extra-inning triple steal; the AL's only triple swipe will
come in 1941.

1917
Honus Wagner is given a day in Pittsburgh in honor of his unretirement for
one more year.

1918
Behind the pitching of Hippo Vaughn, the Cubs beat the Pirates, 5-2. For
Hippo, it is his 11th straight win over the Bucs, going back to July 4, 1916.

1920
In St. Louis, Yankee Carl Mays fills the bases on walks, then forces in
a run with a free pass to Baby Doll Jacobson. Mays gives up 8 runs to the
Browns as he loses his 7th game.

For the second time in 4 days, Detroit's Babe Pinelli successfully pulls
a hidden ball trick on a star player, this time nabbing Washington's Sam
Rice (as researched by Lyle Spatz) at 3B in the 1st inning. Rice reaches 3B
after Braggo Roth's double. The Senators still win, 6-1. Pinelli pulled the
hidden ball trick on the 19th, tagging out Stuffy McInnis at 3B following
an Eddie Foster double. The play costs the Sox at least one run as Howard
Ehmke followed with a balk.

1925
After a day of rest, Pittsburgh again wallops St. Louis, winning 24-6. Max
Carey collects 2 hits in an inning twice, in both the first and 8th frames,
while Kiki Cuyler and Pie Traynor hit grand slams. The Pirates collect 21
hits, 6 for homeruns. Grantham, with a pair of homers, and Carey score
4 times each as the Cards help with 7 errors. Pittsburgh scored 21 runs
in their previous game with the Birds, to set an NL scoring record (20th
century) for 2 games. Another player will not collect two hits in each of
two innings again until Rennie Stennett, also with Pittsburgh, collects
two hits in one inning twice, the first and the fifth frames, in 1975.

1926
The Cardinals pick up 39-year-old Grover Alexander (3-3) on waivers from the
Cubs to help in the pennant chase. Alexander will rejoin Bill Killefer, fired
as Cubs manager last year, and now a Cardinal coach. Alex, who has not been
in uniform for a month, will be 9-7 down the stretch, including 2 shutouts.

1927
The Cards strengthen their hold on 2nd place by defeating the Cubs, 11-5,
to sweep the series. Pete Alexander, pitching out of turn at his own request,
stops the Cubs on 6 hits. Alexander wanted to face the team that had shipped
him down the river last season. Frisch has 3 hits to put him at .331,
a point ahead of Hornsby, for whom he was traded.

1928
Journeyman hurler Hank Johnson of the Yankees blanks the star-studded
Athletics 4-0. In the game for Connie Mack's team are Ty Cobb, Mickey
Cochrane, Al Simmons, Jimmie Foxx, Eddie Collins, Tris Speaker and Lefty
Grove.

1930
At Shibe, the Yanks turn tables on the A's and sweep a doubleheader, winning
10-1 and 20-13. Ruth continues his hot hitting, belting two homers in the
opener and one in the nitecap, giving him 6 homers in 3 games tieing a ML
record (5 in two games also tied a ML record). Lou Gehrig matches Ruth in
the nitecap, cracking three homeruns.

1931
The tail-end Browns take the final game, 14-10, in the 5-games series with
the Yankees. Oscar Melillo scores 5 runs as St. Louis overcomes a pair of
HRs by Lou Gehrig, each with Ruth on base. Gehrig hits 5 homers, 4 singles
and 3 doubles in the series.

1932
The National League, at a meeting of club presidents, finally approves the
use of uniform numbers to identify players. Although some teams in the AL
implemented digits on their jerseys on a regular basis staring in 1929,
the Senior Circuit had refused to follow suit, probably as the result of
the Cardinals being harassed by opposing players and fans when they wore
numerals on their sleeves in 1923.

1934
Bill Terry and Joe Cronin, managers of the 1933 pennant winners, are named
to head the All-Star teams, establishing a precedent that is still followed.

Detroit takes over first place, beating Washington 11-3, dislodging the
Yankees who lose 4-1 to Cleveland.

1936
At Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, Ival Goodman hits an unusual homerun when his
fifth-inning fly ball lands and stays on top of the scoreboard in right
field. With the perched ball considered in play, the three Dodger outfielders
watch the Reds' right fielder round the bases for an easy inside-the park
round-tripper in their 7-2 loss to Cincinnati.

1938
Chicago's Hank Steinbacher gets 6 hits - five singles and a double - in 6
at-bats as the White Sox pound Washington 16-3.

1939
Against the A's Lynn Nelson, Detroit's Barney McCosky leads off with a homerun
and Earl Averill quickly follows with another solo shot. It's the 2nd time
in AL history that the first two batters in a game have homered. But the
A's and Nelson come back to win, 6-5.

Dizzy Dean (4-0) stops the visiting Bees for a 7-1 Cubs win. Chicago scores
5 in the 2nd, 4 on a grand slam by Augie Galan, to ease Dizzy's burden.

At Comiskey Park, the Yankees whip the White Sox, 6-1, to run their record
to 44-11, the best start of the century.

1940
After winning 1-0 yesterday, the Senators trip the Browns, 11-10. The Browns
take an early lead on Harlond Clift's grand slam and two homers by Johnny
Berardino, the 2nd with 2 men on.

The Cardinals squash the Boston Bees, 9-2 with a 7 run 6th inning. Boston
contributes 8 errors including 3 in the Birds' big frame. Stu Miller reaches
base twice on errors in the 6th, the only NL player to do so this century.

1941
In their 5-4 victory over Detroit, the Yankees establish a new record by
hitting at least one homerun in 18 straight contests. The Tigers had set the
mark last year with 17. Joe DiMaggio's sixth inning blast not only breaks
the major league mark, previously held by the Tigers, but also continues
his own consecutive game hitting streak to 35 games.

1944
Charley Schantz gets the win when the Phillies blank Boston for 15 innings,
matching the longest shutout in franchise history. Philadelphia right-fielder
Ron Northey's homer in the top of the frame scores the game's only run in
the 1-0 victory at Braves Field.

In the doubleheader opener in Philadelphia, Ron Northey homers in the bottom
of the 15th off starter Al Javery for a 1-0 Phillies win over the Braves. It
is a first for the Phils to end a game like that. The Braves answer quickly
in the 2nd game as Tommy Holmes leads off with a HR and, a batter later,
Butch Nieman bangs a 2-run homer. That's all the support Jim Tobin needs,
as he throws his 2nd no-hitter, albeit shortened, winning 7-0. The game is
called in the 5th inning because of darkness.

1946
Bill Veeck, head of a syndicate which includes Bob Hope and Harry Grabiner,
purchases the Cleveland Indians for an announced $1,750,000. This launches
Veeck on a long career as a lively promoter.

At Ebbets Field, the second-place Cards deal a 3-1 loss to the Dodgers,
whittling Brooklyn's lead to 1 1/2 games over the Cards. Howie Pollet
and Rex Barney each pitch six scoreless innings, but the Redbirds send 11
batters to the plate in the 7th and five flutter across. The final is 5-1.

The 3rd-place Cubs sweep a pair from the Giants, winning the opener 5-2
behind Hank Wyse. Wyse's shutout is broken in the 9th when Jack Graham legs
out an inside-the-park homer. In the nitecap, the Bruins score six in the
7th to give an 8-5 win to reliever Hi Bithorn. Eddie Waitkus, with three
hits including an inside-the-park homer, paces an 11-hit attack.

1947
Ewell Blackwell just misses pitching back-to-back no-hitters (the first
4 days ago against the Braves) when Eddie Stanky of the Brooklyn Dodgers
singles with one out in the 9th inning at Crosley Field. Stanky's hit ends
Blackwell's hitless-inning skein at 19. Blackwell then gets Al Gionfriddo
before Jackie Robinson bangs out a single. Blackwell wins 4-0, his 9th
straight win to improve to 11-2. Joe Hatten hurls hitless ball for 4 2/3
innings and then walks four straight in the 6th to get chased. In the
nitecap, the Dodgers win 9-8 as Carl Furillo drives in 7 runs. His grand
slam in the 4th caps a six-run inning.

The Yankees increase their lead to two games over the Red Sox by defeating
the Tigers, 6-5, as the Red Sox split with the Indians. Yogi Berra's grand
slam in the first inning is the big blow, sending the Tigers to their 9th
straight loss. Detroit is now in 5th place.

1949
The Braves and Cubs use 10 pitchers, who hand out 24 hits and 13 walks, as
Chicago beats the visiting Bostonians, 9-8. Herman Reich has a 3-run HR,
his 1st in the majors, for Chicago, and Sauer and Adkins also homer. Bob
Elliott socks one for Boston. Reich has one assist at 1B, on his way to 83
assists in 85 games, high in the NL. This is the fewest games ever in which
a player has led his position in assists (according to Mike Emeigh). Dom
DiMaggio, in 1940, led AL outfielders in assists while playing just 94 games.

At St. Louis, the Cards overcome a 7-run deficit to rally and beat the
Giants, 11-8. The win moves the Cards a half game behind the front-running
Dodgers. Musial hits his 14th HR to help the Cards win their 23rd in
30 starts.

1950
Larry Jansen of the Giants wins the first game of a doubleheader with a 3-0
shutout of the Cards, and Dave Koslo follows suit with a 5-0 two-hitter in
the 2nd game, giving NY a sweep of the twin bill. Jansen has not allowed a
run in 29 innings, while for Koslo it is the start of a 13-game win streak
over the Cards. The Cards were last shutout in a twinbill on July 2, 1933,
by the Giants.

1951
Willie Mays, 20, hits a 10th-inning HR, the first of his 22 extra-inning
HRs, off 42-year-old Dutch Leonard of the Cubs. It is a 3-run shot that
gives the Giants a 9-6 win.

A power failure at Forbes Field delays the start of the game with the Dodgers
by 2 hours. Rain holds up play in the 6th inning by another 36 minutes,
pushing the ending to 1:56 a.m., the latest game played to date. Brooklyn
has no power problems as Jackie Robinson's homer helps Da Bums to an 8-4
win. Of the 24,966 on hand at the start, 10,000 are still on hand at the end.

1952
At Chicago, Bob Kuzava shuts out the White Sox, 3-0, for New York. Yogi Berra
homers for the Yanks. In the nitecap at Comiskey Park, Mantle provides New
York's only scoring with a homer, as Marv Grissom wins for Chicago, 2-1.

Boston Braves player Sid Gordon hits a two-run homer over the left field
fence at Braves Field. His homer won Gordon the prize of a 100-pound bear
cub for being the first Braves player to homer on "State of Maine Day". After
the game, Gordon was presented with the animal in the Braves clubhouse.

1953
Senators C Ed Fitzgerald pulls off an unassisted DP against Cleveland in
the first game of a doubleheader. The Tribe wins both games by the same
5-2 scores as Lemon, Doby and Mitchell smash HRs in the 6th inning of the
nitecap. Doby also homers in the opener. Lemon wins the nitecap, beating
Masterson, who had a string of 22 straight scoreless innings.

1954
At Ebbets Field, Bud Podbielan pitches a 2-hitter as the Reds roll by the
Dodgers, 13-1.

1956
At Ebbets Field, Brooks Lawrence allows just 2 hits as the Reds beat the
Dodgers, 6-0.

1957
The Yankees win their 9th game in a row, topping the White Sox, 6-5, at
Yankee Stadium. Mantle's homer in the first starts the scoring, and Berra's
homer in the 13th ends it.

At St. Louis, Stan Musial homers in the 8th to tie the score, but the
Dodgers score 2 in the 9th on back to back triples by Reese and Snider
off Mizell to win, 6-4. Gil Hodges has a 3-run homer for the Brooks. Don
Newcombe holds on for his 12th straight win over the Cards going back to
1951, but the Cards hold on to 1st place by a game.

At Wrigley Field, Sacramento pitcher Roger Osenbaugh gives up a PCL-record 9
homeruns in a 22-5 loss to Los Angeles (as noted by John Spalding). Osenbaugh
had not pitched due to illness and his manager Tommy Heath explained,
"I figured a stiff workout would sharpen him up."

1958
Willie Kirkland unloads a 14th inning HR to give SF a 5-4 win over the
Phils. Johnny Antonelli, in relief, tosses 6 shutout innings for the
victory. The nitecap is called after 6 innings with the Giants ahead
1-0. When play is resumed on July 23rd, the Phils will win 3-2.

A game between Olean (New York-Penn League) and Erie is rescheduled from
7:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M. But the Erie Sailors don't get the word and arrive
at the Olean ball park 50 minutes after the 4:00 P.M. starting time, and
the umpires forfeit the game to Olean.

1959
Dodger southpaw Sandy Koufax fans 16 Phillies to set a new record for a
night game, and wins 6-2.

At Kansas City, Mantle drives in 6 runs with a triple and 2 homers to lead
New York to a 13-6 win. Skowron adds his 4th homer in 4 days to move New
York to 3 games out of first place.

1961
Roger Maris leads the Yankees on an 8-3 thrashing of the A's by belting
his 27th homer of the year. He adds two doubles and a single. Maris has

set by Ralph Kiner in 1947.

1962
Boog Powell becomes the first player to homer over the center field hedge
at Memorial Stadium. The Orioles' first baseman goes deep off Boston's Don
Schwall, who gives up the 469-foot shot.

Playing 4 hours and 2 minutes, the Braves outscore the Giants 11-9 in the
NL's longest 9-inning night game.

Stan Musial becomes the all-time total-base leader, raising his total to
5,864, in the first game against the Phillies. St. Louis wins the opener,
7-3, but loses the nightcap, 11-3.

1963
Philadelphia CF Tony Gonzalez plays his 200th straight errorless game to
help rookie Ray Culp beat Roger Craig and the Mets, 2-0.

1965
Ray Barker's ML-record-tying 2nd consecutive pinch-hit HR is wasted in a
game-1 6-2 Yankee loss to the A's. Mickey Mantle adds a HR in the opener,
but in the 4-2 nightcap win he tries to score from 2nd on a wild pitch
and snaps an upper-thigh hamstring. He will be out for 3 weeks. The June
21st Sports Illustrated cover features Mantle with the prescient title
"New York Yankees:  End of an Era?".

1969
An AL record-tying 3-straight 2-out HRs by Ted Kubiak, Reggie Jackson and
Sal Bando in the 3rd inning power a 7-3 Oakland victory over Minnesota in
the first of 2 games. Bando also homers in the first to back Dobson's win
over Jim Kaat. Katt gets a save in the nitecap as Jim Perry squeezes home
Oliva with the winning run in the 13th. Twins win, 4-3.

Dave Leonhard (5-0), who joins the Orioles on a weekend leave from the
National Guard, pitches a 3-hit complete game over the Indians to win,
6-0. In the opener, the Indians win 3-2 behind Sam McDowell.

1970
Rod Carew, batting .376 for the Twins, injures his right knee during an
attempted double play when Milwaukee's Mike Hegan slides into Carew. The
injury will require surgery and sideline him until September. Harmon
Killebrew's 5th inning homer with 2 on enables the Twins to beat the Brewers,
4-3, behind Jim Kaat.

1976
Randy Jones pitches the Padres to a 4-2 win over the Giants, and ties
Christy Mathewson's 63-year-old NL record by going 68 innings without a
base on balls. He receives a standing ovation from the home crowd after
striking out Darrell Evans to end the 7th. His streak ends when he walks
C Marc Hill leading off the 8th. It is Jones' 13th win of the year.

Fred Norman pitches a 4-hitter as the Reds beat the visiting Dodgers, 6-0.

1977
In a 7-4 victory over the Orioles at Memorial Stadium, the Red Sox collect
their 100th round-tripper of the season, the earliest the club has ever
reached the milestone. Today's homers, hit by George Scott, Jim Rice,
Carlton Fisk (2) and Butch Hobson all off Jim Palmer, contribute to a
major league record of 29 homeruns launched by one club in a span of eight
consecutive games. They also set homer records for 7 games (26) and 6 games
(24). The Sox have now won 12 of their last 13 games.

It's not a good year for Texas manager Frank Lucchesi, as Eddie Stanky takes
over, leading the club to a 10-8 triumph over the Twins. The next day, the
"homesick" Stanky will resign.

3-2 loss to the Cardinals for his 3,772nd career hit, moving him past Hank
Aaron into 2nd place on baseball's all-time list.

Ranger Rick Honeycutt shuts out California 4-0, snapping Rod Carew's 25-game
hitting streak in the process. The streak was the longest of Carew's career
and the longest in Angels history.

Red Sox rookie Wade Boggs hits his first ML homerun in the bottom of the 11th
inning to give Boston a 5-4 win over Detroit. Boggs will finally crack the
starting lineup for good after tomorrow's game, in which regular 3B Carney
Lansford severely sprains his ankle while unsuccessfully trying to stretch
a triple into an inside-the-park homerun. Boggs hits .390 in Lansford's
absence and .349 for the season.

1984
In a teary home plate ceremony before the Twins-White Sox game at the
Metrodome, Calvin Griffith and his sister, Thelma Haynes, sign a letter of

the franchise since 1922, when they were adopted by owner Clark Griffith
when the team was the Washington Senators.

(by the Kansas City A's in 1965) is released by the Dodgers, ending a
19-year ML career.

of 311-205, an ERA of 2.86, 3,640 strikeouts (3rd on the all-time list
behind Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton), and 61 shutouts (7th). 198 of Seaver's

1993
In his final day as a professional baseball player, 45-year-old backstop
Carlton Fisk of the White Sox catches his 2,226th game to surpass Bob Boone
as the all-time leader. 'Pudge' played the first 11 seasons in his 24-year
major league career with the Red Sox.

Paced by Kevin Mitchell, who has 2 doubles, a triple and a HR and 5 runs
scored, the first 4 Reds in the lineup plate 14 runs in beating Colorado,
16-13. The Reds rally from deficits of 5-0, 10-6 and 11-10 to win. Mitchell
is in the middle of a 20-game hit streak but will suffer a season-ending
injury in July.

1994
Hitting his 31st homerun of the season, Ken Griffey Jr breaks Babe Ruth's
record for most homers before July 1. Although the Yankee slugger needed only
63 games to reach 30 homers in 1928 and 68 games in 1930, Junior accomplishes
the feat in the Mariners' 70th game of the season. The Mariners win, 12-3,
over the Angels.

In the Mets' 5-2 victory at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, southpaw closer
John Franco picks up his 253rd save, the most by a left hander. The first
two Braves batters in the lineup, Roberto Kelly and Jeff Blauser, both hit
homeruns off New York starter Pete Smith, but the back-to-back first inning
round-trippers will prove to be the only scoring done by the team for the
rest of the game. Greg Maddux is the losing pitcher.

4-0. Alvarez had set a club record with 15 straight wins earlier.

for Chicago with 5 hits on the day, including a double and a 2-run homer
in the 16th.

In Cleveland, Ruben Sierra homers from both sides of the plate as the
Yankees beat the Indians, 11-9. One of Sierra's HRs comes in the 9-run

a homer, and Eddie Murray adds his 488th HR for the Tribe. The game takes
