1901
The Boston Somersets sweep a Bunker Hill day twinbill, 11-1 and 10-4,
part of a 5-game sweep over the White Sox. Chicago relinquishes 1st place
to Boston. Buck Freeman has a homer and a triple in the two games to back
Mitchell and Cy Young.

1902
At Boston, the Giants lose two and also lose Libe Washburn for a month. Boston
wins 6-3 and 13-2, while backup Washburn sustains a broken nose when hit
by a pitch. He'll miss a month.

1904
In a swap greatly criticized in Boston, the Boston Americans send OF Patsy
Dougherty to the Highlanders for weak-hitting rookie Bob Unglaub, who will
play in just 6 games before being hospitalized with blood poisoning (one
report says alcohol poisoning). Dougherty is not the only Patsy changing
uniforms this month. For $750, the White Sox release Patsy Flaherty (1-2)
to Pittsburgh where he will win 19 more games. This will be his only winning
season, but his feat of winning 20 games while pitching for two teams in a
season will be matched only by Joe McGinnity, Hank Borowy and Rick Sutcliffe.

The Giants' Ed Poole allows 3 Brooklyn hits in beating the Superbas, 2-0,
in the opener of a 4-game series.

1905
At Robison Field, Mathewson wilts in the heat, but Hooks Wiltse relieves to
preserve the Giants' 7-2 win over St. Louis. Charlie McFarland takes the loss.

1906
In another test of Sunday baseball in Brooklyn, Superbas prexy Charles
Ebbets comes up with a twist - patrons will pay after the game is played,
placing contributions in convenient boxes. 'Nice try' say the police who
arrest Ebbets, manager Ned Hanlon, the visiting Reds' manager Joe Kelley, and
starting P Mal Eason. The case is dismissed as no admission was charged. In
addition to the visit to the police precinct, the Reds whip Brooklyn, 3-0.

At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson appears in old form, yielding 8 hits in
beating the Cardinals, 2-1. Jack Taylor takes the loss when 2B Pug Bennett
bobbles Roger Bresnahan's grounder in the 8th and a run scores.

1907
The Red Sox sign their 4th manager this season when Deacon Jim Maguire
takes over for Bob Unglaub. Unglaub's record was 9-20.

1908
The Giants sweep two from the visiting Reds. Mathewson takes the opener,
2-1, over Andy Coakley, and the Giants take the nitecap, 4-2.

1910
When Louis Drucke falters against the Pirates in the top of the 9th, Giants
manager John McGraw calls for Bugs Raymond to protect the 3-2 lead. Raymond
had supposedly been warming up behind the stands, but apparently had visited
a saloon across the way, and swapped a ball for two shots of whiskey. Raymond
hits two batters, allows two hits and tosses one wild, and the Pirates win,
6-3. A furious McGraw suspends the pitcher indefinitely. Bugs will be back
on July 5th.

The Chicago Cubs edge Brooklyn, 1-0, behind the pitching of Mordecai
Brown. For Brown, it is his 12th straight win over Brooklyn stretching back
to August 8, 1906.

1911
The Yankees complete a three-game sweep of Detroit as Jack Warhop wins,
3-2. Cobb is held to an infield single.

Cards pitcher Bob Harmon allows just 3 hits in beating Mathewson and the
Giants, 2-1. Matty allows just 2 hits in the loss.

1913
Chicago beats the first-place Phillies again, 4-0. In the 3rd, Chicago's
Heinie Zimmerman is ejected for the third time in five days, this time
for hollering at umpire Bill Klem who promptly tosses him. Malcom Easton
thumbed him on the 13th and William Brennan on the 15th. It is Zim's 5th
thumbing since May 19th and it will prompt a fan to send half a $100 bill
to Zimmerman, and half to Klem. Zim will win the other half of the "split
century" on July 2nd by not getting thrown out of a game for two weeks.

1914
At Philadelphia, Phils OF Sherry Magee collects a ML-record tying 4 doubles
against the Cardinals, including the game-winner. With a runner on 2B in
the 10th, Magee's blow lands in the bleachers but the rules give him only
a double. The Phils win, 5-4.

Mathewson blanks the slumping Pirates, 5-0, allowing just 5 hits. George
McQuillan is the losing pitcher.

1915
In relief, Cubs right-hander George Washington Zabel throws 18 1/3 innings of
the Cubs' 4-3 victory over in Dodgers at West Side Park. 'Zip', establishing
the major league record for longest relief stint in one game, beats Brooklyn
starter Jeff Pfeffer, who tosses a 19-inning complete-game.

1916
The White Sox pound Babe Ruth for 12 hits, including 3 by Joe Jackson, in
8 innings and beat the visiting Red Sox, 5-0. The loss drops Boston into
6th place.

Heinie Groh hits a leadoff homer off Al Demaree for the game's only score
as the Reds beat the Phils, 1-0. Fred Toney is the winner.

1917
The Giants and Yankees play the first Sunday game in New York for a war
charity ... 21,000 fans turn out.

Chicago Tribune reporter Crusinberry writes about yesterday's Red Sox game,
that "the horde of gamblers that assembles in the right field pavilion each
day ... carries on operations with as much vigor and vim as one would see
in the wheat pit of the Chicago board of trade. The same condition prevails
at the National League park (Braves) and although gambling may take place
more or less in all big league parks, there is no other city where it is
allowed to flourish so openly. Just why this betting ring is allowed in
Boston and not tolerated in other cities never has been explained by the
baseball magnates, but it is supposed to carry a political angle which has
the hands of the magnates tied." He contnues, "The fact that Harry Frazee,
new owner of the Red Sox, tried to prevent resuming play after the riot
shows he needs some coaching on the way to conduct baseball business,
though he may be a most successful theatrical man."

1918
The National Commission rules that P Scott Perry, who has been winning
games for the Athletics, belongs to the Boston Braves. Although purchased
by the Braves from Atlanta in 1917, the deal was not completed. While on
Atlanta's ineligible list, he was sold to Connie Mack. Aroused by Perry's
AL success, the Braves enter their proper claim. Mack breaks precedent,
goes outside organized baseball to civil court, and gets an injunction
against Boston. The NL, having sat still for the loss of George Sisler,
is furious. The clubs' anger at player-allocation decisions will ultimately
topple the National Commission, making way for Judge K.M. Landis.

The Detroit-New York game ends in a 5-5 tie, called after 8 innings in
Detroit because the Yankees have to catch a train to Cleveland.

1919
Alexander wins his 4th in a row for the Cubs, beating the visiting Giants
7-2. A muscle pull will sideline Alex until July 15th. Frankie Frisch makes
his debut, pinch hitting for Hal Chase and making an out.

The Indians sweep two from the host Red Sox, winning 4-3 and 3-2. Smoky Joe
Wood picks up a save in the opener in his only pitching appearance of the
year. Guy Morton wins the nitecap despite giving up a HR and two singles
to Ruth.

1922
The Yankees lose at Detroit, 9-8, as both teams combine for an AL-record
9 triples. Detroit has six three-baggers. Huggins protests the game in the
7th when umpire Hildebrand refuses his claim for a triple on Ward's drive
that Cobb went back into the crowd to catch.

1923
Reds IF Sammy Bohne spoils Dodger Dazzy Vance's no-hitter with a 9th
inning two-out pop-fly single. But Vance wins, 9-0, stopping the Reds'
9-game winning streak.

At Chicago, the Phils' Whitey Glazner notches a 6-4 victory over Tiny
Osborne. The Tribune will report tomorrow that when an elevated passenger
train is delayed at Addison Street, the conductor jumps off. When the
motorman realizes he has no conductor, he notifies officials, who find the
conductor in the bleachers at Cubs Park.

In his first game for Washington, Nationals starter Skipper Friday walks 14
White Sox batters to help Chicago to a 5-3 win in 11 innings. The victory
goes to Dixie Leverett. Ossie Bluege ties a ML mark by striking out 5 times.

1924
Playing for Hartford, Lou Gehrig, who will hit a record 23 bases-loaded
homers in the majors, hits his only minor league grand slam. Hartford wins,
5-2, over Worcester.

1925
In the third record runs-scored-in-an-inning to occur within 2 1/2 weeks,
the Tigers score 13 runs in the 6th and beat the Yankees, 19-1, at Yankee
Stadium. It takes 49 minutes to play the top of the 6th, in which there are
7 walks and 6 hits, one a grand slam by Ty Cobb. John Tavener walks twice
in the frame and Johnny Basslet ties a ML record by reaching base twice on
errors in the inning. Eleven runs score before the first out is made. The
score is the most runs ever racked up by an opponent in the House that Ruth
built, though it will be topped in 2004 by Cleveland. Coach Oscar Stanage
comes on as catcher for the Tigers and goes 1 for 1 in his last appearance
as a player. His first at-bat came in 1906. Lou Gehrig has two of the four
hits off Dauss, a homer and a triple.

The Yankees waive iron man Ev Scott to the Senators for $4,000. Scott holds
the consecutive-games-played record with 1,307.

The Reds' Dolf Luque shuts out the first-place Giants winning, 1-0.

Tom Zachary pitches Washington to a 2-1 win over the Browns. Manager Harris
has a single to extend his hitting streak to 23 games.

1926
The Browns' Ken Williams hits a grand slam in the 2nd inning and St. Louis
holds on to beat Washington, 9-7. Wally Schang adds a triple and homer as
Tom Zachary goes the distance for the win.

At Detroit, the A's use a late rally to beat the Tigers 12-9. They also
stop Ed Wells' string of 33 consecutive scoreless innings pitched.

Hal Rhyne hits a 2-run homer in the top of the 13th at the Polo Grounds
to give the Pirates a 5-3 lead, but Freddie Lindstrom answers with a 3-run
homer in the bottom of the inning for a 6-5 Giants victory. Lindstrom has
to elbow his way to home plate and jubilant fans storm the field.

1927
The Phils hammer the Cubs 12-2, to snap Chicago's win streak at 12 games.

1928
Dazzy Vance is dazzling as he strikes out 15 in Brooklyn's 4-0 win over
the Cubs. Batterymate DeBarry makes 17 putouts, a NL record, since topped.

1930
Chuck Klein sets a Phils club record by hitting in his 26th straight game,
collecting a single in the 8th inning. Klein started his streak on May 18
and has hit .482 since then, but he will go hitless on the 20th to end the
streak at 26. Lefty O'Doul's 10th inning single drives home the winner and
the Phils edge the Pirates, 5-4.

1931
Tommy Connolly, who had umpired the first AL game in 1901, retires as an
active arbiter to become supervisor of AL umpires.

1933
The Phils send Hal Lee, coming off a career year last year (.303, 18 homers),
and Pinky Whitney to the Braves for INF Fritz Knothe, OF Wes Schulmerich,
and cash.

1934
The Dean brothers collaborate to give the Cards a double victory over the
Phillies. Paul (8-0) hurls a 5-hit shutout to win the opener, 6-0, and Dizzy,
in relief, wins the nitecap, 7-5, when rains ends it after 8 innings. It's
Diz' 9th win of the year.

Lefty O'Doul belts a pinch grand slam in the 6th inning, off Heine Meine,
to help the first place Giants to a 9-3 win over the Pirates. The 4th place
Bucs have lost 7 of 8 games.

1935
Recently released P Fred Marberry joins the AL umpiring staff.

Judge Landis rules Alabama Pitts may play for the Albany Senators (IL)
but only in regular season games - no exhibitions.

1936
New York wins, 15-4 and 12-2, at Cleveland. Red Ruffing wins in the
opener scattering 13 hits and contributing two singles and two HRs to the
offense. In the nitecap, Rolfe, Gehrig and Dickey belt 3rd inning homers to
put it away. The first two blasts come off Roxie Lawson while Vic Sorrell
serves up Dickey's.

Roy Henshaw is driven from the box, the first Cubs pitcher to not finish
a game in 13 matches. But the Cubs win their 13th straight, beating the
Phillies, 5-3.

1940
Not a single assist is recorded by any of the Boston Bee infielders in the
first game of a doubleheader versus Pittsburgh. Boston wins 5-3, then takes
the nitecap, 5-1.

Citing upset nerves, Cleveland catcher Frank Pytlak quits the team. Pytlak,
who had been a holdout all spring training, will be dealt to the Red Sox
in December. The Indians bring up young Jim Hegan from Wilkes-Barre.

1941
In the Yankees' 8-7 loss to Chicago, Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak is
extended to 30 straight games when his easy seventh-inning grounder takes a
bad hop off Luke Appling's shoulder. The "Yankee Clipper's" fortunate hit
also breaks the team's record for hits in consecutive games, previously
held by Roger Peckinpaugh (1919) and Earle Combs (1931) who both had 29.

1942
In a doubleheader at Cincinnati, Braves vet Paul Waner is 0 for 4 in game
1, and collects his 2,999 hit in game 2. He hits a grounder off the glove
of SS Eddie Joost that is ruled a hit - his 3,000th - but Waner, standing
on first base, gestures to the official scorer, Jerry Moore of the Boston
Globe, not to credit him with a hit. The ruling is changed to an error.

The Tigers' Dizzy Trout stops the Yankees, 1-0. It is New York's first
shutout since last year.

1943
Player-manager Joe Cronin of the Red Sox hits two 3-run pinch HRs, going
deep off Russ Christopher and then Don Black in each game of a doubleheader,
as Boston beats the St. Louis Browns, 5-4, and loses, 8-7. Cronin is the
first major leaguer to pinch-hit homeruns in both ends of a doubleheader. He
had hit a 3-run pinch HR two nights before against the A's for three HRs
in his last four ABs. He flied out in the 2nd game on the 15th. Cronin
will pinch-hit 43 times this year with 18 hits, including an AL record 5
pinch-hit HRs. His 25 RBIs is also a record, subsequently tied.

Mel Ott, the Giants' player-manager, walks 5 times in an 8-5 win over Kirby
Higbe and the Dodgers. Ott also received 5 free passes in games in 1929
and 1933. With a base on balls in his last trip to the plate yesterday
and again on his first at-bat tomorrow, Ott garners 7 consecutive walks,
a NL mark that Eddie Stanky will match in 1950.

1944
Although he will continue to play in the minor leagues until 1955, Ed Levy
appears in his 40th and final game of his three-year tenure in the major
leagues. The Irish Catholic first baseman, born as Edward Clarence Whitner
in 1911, is asked to start using his stepfather's surname by Yankee team
president Ed Barrow to help the club attract more Jewish fans to the Bronx
ballpark.

1948
Braves reliever Bill Voiselle wins a pair today over the Cubs, 7-6 and
8-7. Cliff Chambers and Jess Dobernic take the losses.

1951
In Boston, the Dodgers win the first of two, 3-1, behind Carl Erskine's
2-hitter. Gil Hodges hits his 34th homer in support. The Braves jump
on Johnny Schmitz for 3 runs in the first inning and take the nitecap,
4-3. Jackie Robinson leaves 13 baserunners in the 2 games.

The Giants top the Phils, 8-5, with reliever George Spencer earning the
win. Al Dark and Wes Westrum each collect 4 hits. New York is 9 in back
of Brooklyn.

In the 2nd game of a DH with the A's, White Sox righty reliever Luis
Aloma wins, 9-0. It is the only start in Aloma's career, making him the
2nd pitcher this century to throw a shutout in his only start (as noted by
historian Walt Wilson.) Don Fisher in 1945 was the first. The Sox win the
opener in Philadelphia, 4-1, behind Randy Gumpert.

1952
In Detroit, the Yanks come back from a 6-1 deficit as Mantle clouts a homer
into the upper deck of left-center off Bill Hoeft in the 6th. But Detroit
pushes over a run in the 11th to win, 7-6.

The Holy Cross Crusaders defeat the University of Missouri 8-4 to win the
NCAA College Baseball title.

1953
The Red Sox wallop Detroit, 17-1, collecting 20 hits. Dick Gernert has
two homers and four RBIs, while Tom Umphlett and Billy Goodman combine for
7 hits to beat Dick Marlowe. The Tigers finally score in the 9th to stop
Willard Nixon's consecutive streak of 21 innings without allowing a run.

1954
Yankee rookie Bob Grim relieves in the 5th inning and holds the White Sox to
3 hits in 4 innings. He also belts his first ML HR and a single to drive in
3 runs in the 7-6 win. Phil Cavarretta's pinch HR in the 9th and a double
by Sawatski brings in Johnny Sain to preserve the win. The Yankees are now
tied for 2nd place with Chicago.

Let's end this thing. Starting pitcher Robin Roberts scores the winning
run in the 15th inning to give the Phils a 3-2 win over the Cards. The loss
goes to Joe Presko who takes over after Gerry Staley goes 12 innings.

1955
At Comiskey, Mickey Mantle ties the game at one apiece by hitting a Dick
Donovan pitch 10 rows up in the top tier of the RF stands. New York scores
another to win, 2-1.

At Wrigley, Curt Simmons is the winner, 3-2, when batterymate Stan Lopata
hits a 2-out homer in the 9th off starter Bob Rush. For Rush it is his 14th
straight loss to the Phils, the longest losing skein to a single team for
any Cubs pitcher (as noted by historian Ed Hartig).

1956
In Fred Haney's first games managing the Braves, Joe Adcock hits 3 of his
NL record 13 Ebbets Field HRs in a doubleheader win over Brooklyn before
34,394 fans. In the first game, his game-winning 9th-inning HR (Adcock's
second HR of the game) off Ed Roebuck lands on the roof, making him the
only slugger in history to accomplish this. The ball left the field at the
350-foot mark in LF, clearing the 83-foot wall. The Braves win, 5-4 and
2-1. Under Grimm's platoon system, Adcock started only against lefties,
and last started June 12. He hit a pinch HR yesterday.

At the Polo Grounds, Joe Nuxhall fires a 2-hitter as the Reds edge the
Giants, 1-0.

1958
Ossie Virgil, who became the first black to play for the Tigers 11 days
ago, goes 5 for 5 in his first home game at Briggs Stadium. The Dominican's
performance helps Detroit to beat the Senators, 9-2. Frank Bolling adds 4
hits to back Hoeft.

1959
At Yankee Stadium, Mantle lashes a Ray Moore 3-0 pitch some 470 feet into
the RF bleachers to lead New York to a 7-3 win over the White Sox.

1960
A 2-run HR off Wynn Hawkins at Cleveland Municipal Stadium makes Ted
Williams the 4th player in ML history to hit 500 HRs. The Red Sox win 3-1
behind Frank Sullivan's 12 strikeouts.

In Chicago, Bill Veeck's new $300,000 exploding scoreboard is silent as
no Sox players hit homers. However, when Clete Boyer bangs one in the 2nd
inning, all the Yankees light sparklers and greet the third baseman on the
dugout steps. Berra leads the sparklers in the bullpen. Mantle's 8th-inning
homer prompts another round of sparklers as the Yanks win, 4-2.

1961
With 2 out and 2 on in the 9th, Mickey Mantle homers off Paul Foytack into
the RF upper deck. Elston Howard follows with a HR, but Detroit hangs on
to win 12-10 over the 3rd-place Yanks.

1962
Gene Woodling becomes the first major leaguer to play for both the Yankees
and the Mets. In his National League debut, the 38-year-old outfielder goes
2 for 4 scoring two runs for the new expansion team in an 8-7 loss to the
Cubs at the Polo Grounds.

Lou Brock of the Cubs hits a HR into the right-CF bleachers at the Polo
Grounds, 460-470 feet from home plate, in the first game of a Chicago
doubleheader sweep, 8-7 and 4-3. He is the 2nd player to reach those bleacher
seats; Joe Adcock was the first. In the nitecap, the Cubs win on Santo's
HR in the 9th.

Mets 1B Marv Throneberry hits an apparent triple, but misses both 1B and 2B,
and is called out on an appeal play. The Cubs eke out an 8-7 win.

Before a crowd of 70,916, the Indians sweep a pair from the Yankees, 6-1
and 6-3, and boost their lead over the Twins to 2 games. Donovan (10-2)
becomes the ML's first 10 game winner in the opener. In the nitecap, the
Indians hit 3 straight homers in the 2nd off Jim Stafford. Jerry Kindell,
Bubba Phillips and Jim Maloney connect. The Tribe completes a four-game
sweep of the World Champs, much to the delight of the largest home crowd
in eight seasons.

1963
Bob Scheffing (24-36) is axed as manager of the Tigers. Dodgers scout
Charlie Dressen replaces him.

1964
The Red Sox lead New York, 3-1, in the 8th when Mantle reaches Dick Radatz
for a homer into the RF bleachers. New York scores again in the 9th to tie,
but the Bosox win in 12 innings, 4-3. Radatz is the winner, his 4th straight
over New York.

1965
Julian Javier suffers a broken finger when hit by a Vern Law pitch. The
St. Louis 2B will be out 7 weeks. Pittsburgh's Law wins the game 4-1.

1967
A 9-hour 5-minute doubleheader between the Tigers and Athletics is the longest
ever. The first game includes a rain delay, and the 2nd goes 19 innings before
a Dave Duncan HR wins it, 6-5, for the A's. Detroit takes the opener, 7-6.

1969
Behind a complete game shutout by John Hiller, the Tigers roll to an 8-0
win against Mel Stottlemyre and the Yankees. Bill Freehan solos while
Mickey Stanley hits a 3-run homer. Ike Brown makes his debut taking over
at 2B in the 8th for McAuliffe. Brown is the last Negro Leaguer to break
into the major leagues and joins other vets of that league: Aaron, Mays,
Banks, Lou Johnson and Paul Casanova.

1970
At Candlestick Park, Willie Mays (615) and Ernie Banks (504) both homer
in the Cubs' 6-1 victory over the Giants. It is the first time in baseball
history two players with 500 career homeruns have gone deep in the same game.

1971
Don Kessinger goes 6 for 6 (five singles and a double) as the Cubs beat
the Cardinals 7-6 in 10 innings in Chicago. He's the first Cub with 6 hits
since Frank Demaree on July 5, 1937. The Cards tie a ML record by using 5
pitchers in the 8th after the Cubs tie at 5-5.

After the White Sox score 3 in the top half of the 11th, the Twins score
4 in their half to win, 7-6. George Mitterwald drives in the winning run
with his 4th hit.

1973
Darrell Porter and Joe Lahoud each contribute grand slams to Milwaukee's
15-5 rout of Chicago. Lahoud has 6 RBIs in the win. It is Milwaukee's 9th
straight victory, all on the road. The Brewers, first in the East, will
extend their win streak to 10 before sliding down to 5th place.

1976
At Shea Stadium, Dave Kingman hits a walk-off homer to give the Mets a 1-0
victory over the Dodgers. Sky King's game-ending blast comes off Charlie
Hough in the 14th inning.

1977
At Boston, the Sox jump on Yankee starter Catfish Hunter for 4 first-inning
homers as Rick Burleson and Fred Lynn hit leadoff homers, and Carlton Fisk
and George Scott follow suit later in the inning. Boston adds another homer
enroute to an 11-1 win to take over 1st place in the AL East.

1978
Inspired by Ron Guidry's performance, the crowd at Yankee Stadium initiates
a new baseball tradition when they begin to rhythmically clap each time
there is two strikes on the batter. The 'Gator' strikes out 15 Angels in
six innings and finishes the game with 18 Ks, establishing a new American
League mark for left-handers. Guidry throws a 4-hitter and the Yankees
win, 4-0, over California. The victory raises the Yankee southpaw's record
to 11-0. Guidry's performance will lead the team's television announcer,
Phil Rizzuto, to coin a new nickname referring to the Lafayette Native as
'Louisiana Lightning'.

The Red Sox win their 9th straight, handing the Mariners their 10th straight
loss, 5-4. The Sox score two in the 9th, including a game winning single by
Yaz. Dwight Evans had earlier parked his 15th homer. Bill Lee, wearing a
"friendship first, competition second" t-shirt returns to the Sox and is
fined a day's pay.

1980
Complaining of arm tiredness, Houston's J. R. Richard exits after pitching
5 innings against the Cubs. He is the winner, 7-1, over the Cubs but he
will not pitch for 11 days.

1983
Bob Welch pitches a 6-hitter and hits his first career homer, off Mario
Soto in the 6th, to lead the Dodgers past the Reds, 1-0. Welch is the
11th pitcher in ML history to homer in a 1-0 game, and it will not occur
again this century. The last to do so, according to historian Bob Davids,
was Juan Pizarro, in 1971.

1984
At Yankee Stadium, with one out in the 8th inning, Gary Roenicke hits a grand
slam for the O's, as they beat New York, 6-2. Mike Flanagan benefits, but
he's not the only winner as the homerun makes Anne Sommers of College Park, MD
a million dollars. Ms. Sommers had entered the Equitable Bank's Sweepstakes.

Al Oliver and Jeff Leonard hit RBI singles in the 15th inning to give the
Giants a 5-3 win over the Padres. Oliver tied the game in the 8th with an
RBI single.

1987
Dick Howser, former manager of the Royals and Yankees, loses his courageous
battle against cancer succumbing to a brain tumor at St. Luke's Hospital in
Kansas City. After three surgeries to remove the disease, the 51-year-old
frail-looking skipper had tried to make a comeback with Kansas City but had
to resign after one day of spring-training workouts, becoming physically
too weak to perform his duties. Howser led the Royals to their first World
Championship in 1985, but was forced to give up managing during the 1986
season because of a brain tumor. His uniform number, 10, will be retired
by the club on July 3rd.

1991
The Orioles defeat the Twins, 6-5, putting a halt to Minnesota's 15-game
club-record winning streak - the longest in the majors since 1977. Seven
of the wins came against Cleveland. During the streak, which began June 1,
the Twins go from 5th to leading by 1/2 game. Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr
records his 6th consecutive multi-hit game by going 2-4 in the contest. The
last player to perform the feat was Baltimore's Eddie Murray in 1980.

1993
Baseball owners vote overwhelming, 26-2, in favor of expanding the playoffs
for the first time since 1969. The new system, beginning in 1994, will
double the number of teams that qualify for post-season play to eight by
realigning each league to three divisions and adding two wild card teams.

Giants OF Darren Lewis sets a major league record by playing his 243rd
consecutive errorless game. It is the most ever by an OF at the start of
his career. The Giants defeat the Reds, 5-1, as Bill Swift and Kevin Rogers
combine to 1-hit Cincinnati. Kevin Mitchell's infield single leading off
the 8th inning is the Reds' only hit.

Cleveland 2B Carlos Baerga hits 3 HRs in the Indians' 9-5 loss to Detroit. The
Tigers hit 5 four-baggers of their own, including a pair each by Travis
Fryman and Dan Gladden. Three players with 2 or more homers in a game ties
an AL mark.

Texas OF Juan Gonzalez drives home 8 runs in the Rangers' 18-2 win over
the Angels. Gonzalez has a double and a HR in his 4 hits. Strange has 4
hits and Canseco and Palmeiro also homer.

1994
