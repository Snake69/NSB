1904
Despite yesterday's ruling by William Gaynor of the Brooklyn Supreme Court
prohibiting Sunday baseball, there are no arrests today at Washington
Park. Brooklyn should've arrested Giants pitcher Hooks Wiltse, who allows
just 3 hits in collaring the Superbas, 11-0. Next Sunday, however, Brooklyn's
battery of Oscar Jones and Frank Jackitsh, along with a program seller,
will be arrested on misdemeanor charges and taken to the police station.

Patsy Dougherty makes his first appearance for the Highlanders, collecting
2 hits in a 4-3 win over St. Louis. New York loses the 2nd game, 1-0.

1905
The Giants lose to Cincinnati when New York P Hooks Wiltse accidentally
swallows a quid of chewing tobacco that upsets his stomach and his
pitching. The Reds roll to a 17-7 win, the 8th win in a row for the Reds. In
the 3rd inning, Giants RF George Browne chases down an overthrow behind
first base and is greeted by several bottles tossed at him. One hits him on
the leg, and both managers and a "swarm of coppers" (Cincinnati Enquirer)
converge. Browne will file charges against a fan, but when the case appears
in court the only testimony is given by Reds President Garry Herrmann and
the case is dismissed.

Cleveland clubs the Highlanders, 12-3, behind Nap Lajoie's 5 for 6 hitting.

1906
At Cleveland, the Naps take a pair from New York, 5-0 and 3-2, and switch
places in the standings as a result. New York drops to 3rd. The wins are
costly though as Bill Bradley has his arm fractured when hit by a Bill Hogg
pitch in game 2. He will miss nearly half the season. Hogg reportedly says,
"That big Frenchman (Lajoie) is next on my list." Taking over at third for
Bradley is Jap Barbeau, at 5'5" the smallest man in the league.

NL directors pass a resolution urging all clubs to provide dressing
rooms for visiting teams because the spiked shoes were causing damage and
upsetting hotel managers. Even those teams that do comply, however, offer
such primitive facilities that most teams on the road continue to dress at
their hotels. Another resolution moves the batting practice from in front
of the grand stand to the diamond. A third resolution is passed donating
$500 to the Pacific Coast League, suffering from the damage caused by the
San Francisco earthquake.

1907
Miller Huggins, diminutive 2B of the Reds, leads off the game against New
York with a HR off Christy Mathewson. The rare occurrence (he hits only 9 in
his career) astonishes the home town fans and they celebrate by presenting
him with a pair of shoes, a gold watch, a 5-pound box of chocolates, a
scarf pin and a Morris chair. The Reds win in the 9th when Larry McLean
drives home 2 runs for a 3-2 win.

1909
Walter Johnson has a strange day beating the New York Highlanders, 7-4. He
gives up just 3 hits, but is unusually wild, issuing 7 walks, uncorking 4
wild pitches and hitting one batter, while fanning 10.

The Phils make only 2 hits but beat the Reds, 2-0.

Boston Doves co-owner and president George Dovey, 48, dies suddenly while
on a scouting trip in Ohio. His brother John takes over the presidency.

An exhibition night game featuring two amateur teams is played in the Reds'
park before 3,000 spectators, including the Cincinnati and Philadelphia
teams, which had played there earlier. The hometown Elks win, 8-5.

1911
At Detroit's Bennett Field, Cobb singles off Chicago's Irv Young, then
scores from first on a single. With his hit, Cobb equals Bill Bradley's AL
hit record of 29 straight games set in 1902. Detroit wins 8-5,

1913
Wilbur Good hits the first pinch-hit HR in Cubs history, off Grover Alexander
in the 8th, but that's all of Chicago's scoring as the Phils win, 2-1.

In Cincinnati, the Giants defeat the Reds, 8-7, to sweep 4 from the
Reds. Mathewson allows 12 hits but holds on to beat Rube Benton.

1916
Former major leaguer Johnny Dodge, playing for Mobile (Southern League)
is hit by as pitch from Nashville's Shotgun Rogers and killed. Dodge played
for the Phillies and Reds in 1912-13. Seemingly unfazed, Rogers will go on
the pitch five straight shutouts after the fatal beaning. He'll break in
with the A's in 1919 and compile a 4-12 record.

1917
In the opener of 2, the Red's Hod Eller loses, 2-1, to the Cubs, scattering
6 hits and striking out 6. He then starts the nitecap and is ahead 6-2 when
the game is called after 6 innings.

1918
The Yankees purchase OF Ham Hyatt from the Braves, but he proves to be a
turkey and is soon released. Tomorrow they will buy Brownie pitcher John
Robinson, who will suffer the same fate as Hyatt.

1920
At Brooklyn, Grover Alexander wins, 5-3, in 12 innings for Chicago. Bob
O'Farrell's 3-run homer in the 12th off starter Al Mamaux is the winner.

1922
In the Yankees' 8th straight loss, a 3-2 decision to the Indians, Babe Ruth
explodes at umpire Bill Dinneen and gets tossed. He'll receive a two-day
suspension, his 4th suspension of the year, when he continues to complain
tomorrow about the umpire. Again, it was a call at 2B that sets the Bambino
off, although he was in the field this time.

1923
At Yankee Stadium, Tiger 1B Lu Blue singles in the first inning, then is
replaced by a courtesy runner (as noted by Retrosheet). Blue was hit in
the head by a batted ball in pregame practice and is still woozy. Blue then
returns to 1B in the bottom of the first and plays out the game, a 6-5 loss
to the Yankees.

Bubbles Hargrave drives in the lone run of the game in the 11th to give the
Reds a 1-0 win over the Dodgers. Dolf Luque, in the midst of a 29-inning
scoreless skein, beats Burleigh Grimes. Grimes will set a post-1900 record
this year with decisions in all 39 of his starts (21-18).

1926
After winning yesterday 13-5, the Reds continue to punish Phillies pitching,
sweeping 2 by scores of 8-2 and 14-6. Rube Bressler collects 7 hits,
including a HR, for the afternoon.

1927
Jack Scott becomes the last pitcher to go the distance in both ends of a
doubleheader. The 35-year Phillies right-hander, who will compile a 9-20
record, beats Cincinnati in the opener, 3-1, but loses the nightcap, 3-0,
in the Redlands Field twin bill.

At Cincinnati, Phils pitcher Jack Scott performs an ironman feat by pitching
two complete games of a doubleheader, beating the Reds 3-1 before losing,
3-0. The 35-year-old is the last to pitch 2 complete games in one day. Scott
allows 6 hits in the opener and 9 in the nitecap, with two going for extra
bases. The Reds score in each of the first 3 innings of the nitecap and
Eppa Rixey scatters 7 hits to win. Carl Mays loses the opener.

Cleveland's Joe Shaute pitches a 4-hit 3-2 win over the White Sox to snap
Ted Lyons' 9-game win streak. Lyons has 2 hits and a run in the loss.

1929
In their 2nd straight doubleheader, the Giants sweep the Phillies, winning
15-14 in 11 innings, and 12-6. Mel Ott has 2 HRs and 4 doubles for the day -
just the 2nd major leaguer to have 6 long hits in a twinbill - while Edd Roush
goes 8 for 12. In tomorrow's 11-6 win over the Phils, Ott will have 3 RBIs,
giving him 11 straight games with at least one ribbie. The 20-year-old will
have 27 RBI in 11 games, and will finish the season with 151, 2nd in the NL.

1932
The last place Red Sox name Marty McManus manager of the team (11-44),
replacing Shano Collins. Collins, who resigned yesterday, guided the Sox
to a 6th-place finish last season.

In Boston, Reds backup catcher Bob Asbjornson is given a day by fellow
townsman of Concord, MA. Asby receives a large check and then celebrates
by hitting his lone career homer. He also strokes an apparent triple but
is called out for missing 2B. The Reds win, 5-0, behind Si Johnson. After
the game Asbjornson discovers the check is not signed. When he brings it
to the restaurant where he is to be honored, no one else shows up.

1934
Veteran infielder Pie Traynor replaces George Gibson as Pirates manager.

1935
Chick Hafey, who quit the Reds and returned home to California, asks to be
put on the voluntary retired list. He played 15 games this season. He'll
come back in 1937 for one last fling.

1936
Joe McCarthy is named to manage the AL All-Stars, rather than the high-strung
Mickey Cochrane, who is very close to a nervous breakdown.

1938
After walking the leadoff hitter, Elbie Fletcher, on 4 pitches, the
Reds' Johnny Vander Meer extends his string of hitless innings to 21 2/3
(including the final out in the game before Vandy's 1st no-hitter) before
Debs Garms singles for Boston in the 4th. Vandy coasts home, 14-1, allowing 3
hits. Vandy falls short of the record of 23 scoreless innings set by Cy Young
in 1908. Young is one of 34,511 on hand for today's game at Braves' Field.

1940
In a night game following the Medwick beaning, the Cards make 7 errors in
an 8-3 loss to Brooklyn. Slick-fielding Cardinal SS Marty Marion makes 3
errors in the 7th inning.

1941
Joe DiMaggio goes 3 for 3 against the White Sox to extend his consecutive
game hit streak to 32.

1942
For the first and only time in a career that spans 1,787 contests, Joe
DiMaggio strikes out three times in a game. Indians hurler Mel Harder does
the deed in the Tribe's 5-4 victory over the Yankees at Cleveland Stadium.

At Forbes Field, Paul Waner, now with the Boston Braves, joins Cap Anson
and Honus Wagner as the only NL players with 3,000 hits, with a single
off Rip Sewell. The Braves outfieder becomes the seventh major leaguer to
accomplish this feat and the first to do it since 1925. Two days earlier,
Waner's grounder bounced off an infielder's glove and had been ruled a
hit. Waner, who did not want his 3000th hit to be a tainted one, signaled
to the scorekeeper that it was an error, and the ruling was changed. Bob
Elliott hits 2 HRs to help the Pirates win 7-6 in 11 innings.

With Ernie White on the mound, Pete Reiser steals home in the 4th, and the
run is the difference as the Dodgers beat the Cardinals, 4-3.

At Chicago, Dom DiMaggio's 5th inning inside-the-park homerun is the only
score as the Red Sox top the White Sox, 1-0. The ball rolls under the
Red Sox bullpen bench and Dom circles the bases before RF Wally Moses can
recover it. Charley Wagner is the winner over hardluck Eddie Smith (1-11),
who loses his 3rd 1-0 game this season.

1945
Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower, just back from Europe, is given a
tremendous round of applause from fans at the Polo Grounds. The Braves then
beat New York, 9-2, behind Jim Tobin's pitching and 3 RBIs.

At St. Louis, in what will be dubbed the "Battle of the Dugouts", the 8th
inning produces fireworks as the White Sox score 4 runs to eventually win,
4-1. After reliever George Caster is lifted, he fires the ball into the White
Sox dugout, prompting manager Jimmie Dykes to come out and protest. Browns
catcher Gus Mancuso tells Dykes to shut up Karl Scheel, a Sox bench jockey
who has been mercilessly "riding" the Browns. When Dykes says you can find
him in the dugout, a few Browns, led by Sig Jakucki and Ellis Clary, do just
that, giving Scheel a "most brutal (Dykes)" pounding. The ex-Marine requires
first aid but travels with the team to Cleveland. About 100 spectators mill on
the field to try and see the action. In Cleveland, Dykes sends a telegram to
Will Harridge accusing Browns manager Luke Sewell with instigating the riot.

1947
You'd think he'd learn. In a Texas League game, Fort Worth beats Beaumont,
6-5, in 12 innings. Fort Worth centerfielder Maurice Santomauro throws out
Charles Glunt at the plate three times.

1949
The Tigers roll over the Senators in a twinbill as Virgil Trucks wins, 9-0,
and Freddie Hutchinson follows with a 7-0 victory.

1951
Following the Cubs' 3-0 shutout of the Braves by Bob Rush, Tommy Holmes
replaces Billy Southworth as the Boston manager.

Before 61,596 at Yankee Stadium, Mantle, batting leadoff, has 2 homers and
4 RBIs, but misses two catchable balls. He has a 3-run homer to match Yogi
Berra, as the Yankees top the White Sox, 11-9 in the first of 2 games. In
the nitecap, Mantle is 1 for 1 with a homer, before being replaced in CF
by Gene Woodling. But the first-place Sox take a 5-4 win. Eddie Stewart
has a 3-run homer and Phil Masi collects 3 hits and a homer.

Wally Yonamine, an American of Japanese descent (a Nisei) born in Hawaii,
plays his first game with the Yomiuri Giants of Tokyo. He will become the
first genuine American star in Japanese baseball, winning batting titles in
1954, 1956 and 1957. In 1957 he will also be the Central League MVP. From
1963 to 1986 he will be active with various teams as a coach or manager.

Willie Jones cracks a pair of homers, one with the bases loaded, to drive in
6 runs as the Phils roll over the host Pirates, 9-2. Jones' first homer comes
in the first inning with Ashburn on base, and his second is an inside-the-park
grand slam in the 8th inning. Every Philley batter collects a hit including
winning hurler Russ Meyer. Murry Dickson is chased early with Ted Wilks,
in his first appearance for the Pirates, relieving.

1952
After 4 straight losses to the Cubs, Carl Erskine of the Dodgers no-hits
them 5-0, topping Warren Hacker, at Ebbets Field. The only base runner is
relief P Willard Ramsdell, who Erskine walks in the 3rd. Erskine is now 6-1
for the first-place Dodgers. The 25-year-old right-hander will also no-hit
the Giants in 1956.

The A's Bobby Shantz wins his 11th in a row, stopping the White Sox, 4-1,
while batting in 2 runs. It is his 12th win in 13 starts. The 11 wins is
the longest streak in the AL since Johnny Rigney had 11 wins in a row for
the 1939 White Sox. Shantz is 22-3 since last July.

1954
Capped by a pinch homer by Hoot Evers, the Giants score 4 runs in the 9th
off Cards reliever Miller. Cards pitcher Tom Poholsky, who is hit on the
pitching hand by a liner in the 3rd, is forced to give way to Miller after
8 innings. Poholsky will be diagnosed with a broken finger and will not
win a game till August 11.

1955
Giants Leo Durocher benches Willie Mays for 2 days for a "rest" and starts
Whitey Lockman. The Braves win, 8-7.

in 15th inning to win 1-0 over the Cubs. Jones doubles home Blaylock for
the score to get the win for reliever Jack Meyer. In the nitecap, the Cubs
win 8-7 in 7 innings as darkness falls.

1956
Musial and Morgan hit 2-run homers in the first inning, off Sandy Koufax,
as the Cards beat the Dodgers, 6-0. Murry Dickson pitches a shutout, his
first win over Brooklyn after 8 straight defeats. His last win over the
Brooks was also 6-0, on August 22, 1954.

the opener as Clint Courtney, using the big glove, is twice charged with
batter interference, the first loading the bases in the 4th.

1961
Roger Maris' 25th homerun, a ninth-inning shot off Kansas City pitcher Jim
Archer, puts him seven games ahead of Babe Ruth's record pace.

is 7 for 8.

1963
At Fenway Park, his first major league at-bat, Gates Brown hits a pinch
homerun in the 5th off Boston's Bob Heffner. The homer will be the first of
16 pinch round trippers for the Tiger outfielder during his 13-year career in
Detroit. Brown becomes the AL's 11th player to hit a HR in his first at-bat.

At Yankee Stadium, the Mayor's Trophy Game is revived with the cellar-dwelling
Mets beating the mighty Yanks, 6-2. Prior to leaving for the West Coast,
the Dodgers would play the Bronx Bombers in the annual midsummer exhibition
contest to raise money for sandlot baseball teams.

1967
Steve Hargan of the Indians and the A's Chuck Dobson lock up in a scoreless
duel until, with 2 outs in the 9th inning, Hargan hits his only career

Pilots, 13-10. Trailing 10-9 in the 7th the Sox load the bases and score

sails into RF allowing 2 more to tally.

1970
Despite Mike Epstein's 8 RBIs, the Senators bow to the Orioles 12-10 in the
first game of a doubleheader. Epstein has two homers - one a grand slam -
and a single. Boog Powell drives in 4 runs with 4 hits for the O's. The

10 innings with Richert getting the win with 3 innings of relief.

1971
Indian leadoff batters Graig Nettles and Vada Pinson belt homers off

hits his 15th homer in the 8th.

1972
At Three Rivers Stadium, Roberto Clemente hits a two-run homer in the
bottom of the eighth inning to become the Pirates all-time RBI leader. The
Pittsburgh right fielder's three ribbies in the 13-3 drubbing of the Dodgers
gives the future Hall of Famer a total of 1,274 runs batted in for the Bucs.

Larry Dierker fires Houston's 2nd straight one-hitter, tying a ML record,
beating the Mets, 3-0. He walks Mays twice but Duffy Dyer's single in the

8-4 and 4-1. The Brewers win streak stops at 10.

1974
Steve Busby tosses his second no-hitter in 14 months, giving up just
one walk (George Scott leading off the 2nd inning), beating the Brewers,
2-0, in the first ever no-no thrown by a Kansas City hurler at Kauffman
Stadium. Last season, the 23-year-old Royals right-hander as a rookie held
Detroit hitless in a 3-0 complete game victory at Tiger Stadium for the
team's first no-hitter in franchise history. Busby is the first ML pitcher
to throw no-hitters in his first 2 seasons.

Runners are passed in 2 different games tonight, depriving Giant Ed
Goodson of a HR in a Cardinals-Giants match, and creating confusion in a
Pirates-Dodgers match. Goodson clocks a 3rd inning pitch from Bob Gibson,
then passes teammate Garry Maddox between 1B and 2B. Instead of a HR,
he gets one RBI and a single. The Giants win, 5-4, out-hitting the Cards,
14-5. In the latter, Joe Ferguson apparently strikes out with the sacks full,
and walks away, while Pirate C Manny Sanguillen agrees and rolls the ball
to the mound. Lee Lacy, the LA runner on 3rd jogs to the dugout. The runner
from 2B, Jimmy Wynn comes around but is tagged out sliding at home. Lee
Lacy scurries from the dugout, slides home, and is also tagged out. Lacy,
though tagged, is ruled safe according to the rules which gives him home
automatically when a base on balls is called with the sacks full. The
confusion is deemed moot as the Pirates prevail, 7-3.

1976
Nolan Ryan notches 15 strikeouts as the Angels top the Red Sox, 5-3. Vietnam
vet Bob Jones belts his first ML homer, off Boston's Rick Wise.

1977

At Fenway, Yankee pitchers help put the Red Sox in the record books when they
serve up 5 gopher balls (Doyle, Carbo, Rice, Yaz, Scott) in an 11-1 pasting
for the 3rd loss in a row. Yastrzemski's homer, served up by Dick Tidrow,
is a towering drive down the RF line off the RF facade (to the right of
the retired #'s) the only player to ever reach that height. No one else
has ever come close to duplicating that feat. The Bosox hit a record 16
homers in three victories over the Yankees (six on the 17th, five on the
18th). It wasn't the wind, as New York goes homerless in the series.

1979
In New York 36,211 fans show up to witness the return of Billy Martin as
Yankee manager, but the Yanks lose to the Blue Jays 5-4. Martin had been
named to replace Bob Lemon (34-31) the previous day, and begins his 2nd
stint as New York's skipper, a season earlier than previously announced.

1985

seasons.

1989
With the Mets' 5-3 victory over the Expos, Dwight Gooden wins his 100th

to Hall of Famer Whitey Ford's 100-36 start with the Yankees in 1958.

1990
Gary Carter catches his 1,862nd career game to break Al Lopez' NL mark. He
goes 0 for 3 in the Giants' 4-3 loss to San Diego. Batting for Ed Vosberg
in the bottom of the 5th, Giants Don Robinson becomes the first pitcher to
hit a pinch HR since 1971. San Diego's Bruce Hurst serves up the gopher. His
job done, Robinson does not pitch.

1991

Japan after World War II.

The Reds score 7 runs in the first inning and go on to defeat Atlanta,
12-4, using a 20-hit attack for the second day in a row. Hal Morris,

starter John Smoltz in the frame, as the Atlanta hurler becomes the 14th
pitcher in major league history to surrender 4 round-trippers in a single
inning. He also allows 20 total bases, a 20th century NL record. Atlanta
adds a homer to match the 2-team homerun mark for one inning.

Detroit beats Toronto by a score of 3-1. Mickey Tettleton homers for the
Tigers, marking the 25th consecutive game in which a Detroit player had
hit a round-tripper. That ties the major league record held by the 1941
Yankees. Cleveland's Charles Nagy and Eric Plunk will stop the streak
tomorrow.

The Giants sign OF Darryl Strawberry, recently released from a drug
rehabilitation program in California, and then released by the Dodgers.

1995
Darryl Strawberry signs a one-year contract with the Yankees despite the
fact he is under a sixty-day suspension for drug abuse. During his five
seasons in the Bronx, the southpaw-swinging slugger will contribute to the
team's tremendous success in the late 90's.

1996
Cardinals infielder Ozzie Smith, considered the best all-time defensive
shortstop, announces he will retire at the end of the season after 19 years

when SF beat him. He's the first NLer to win 14 in a row since Gooden in 1985.

In the Blue Jays' 11-3 win over the Mariners, M's star Ken Griffey breaks
a bone in his right hand when he fouls a pitch off it. He'll be out 4 weeks.

1997
Seattle's Randy Johnson wins his seventh straight beating the Texas Rangers,
2-1, allowing one unearned run and four hits in seven innings. while striking

standing ovation at Alexian Field.

Colorado defeats Florida, 10-2, as 1B Todd Helton hits for the cycle.

in a doubleheader against the Port St. Lucie Mets. He only gets credit for
5 in a row, however, since the 1st game of the twinbill was the completion
of a suspended game played on May 7. Matranga drew the 1st 2 walks before
the contest was suspended, but was given credit for 5 in a row since the
records for the game are considered to have occurred on the original date
on which the game was played.

2000
The Yankees embarrass the Red Sox, 22-1. The Yankees break open a close
game by scoring 9 times in the 8th inning, and 7 times in the 9th.

2001
The Twins defeat the Indians, 10-9 in 12 innings, despite 5 hits,
including a double and 3 HRs, by Cleveland OF Ellis Burks. A two-run 2B
by A.J. Pierzynski in the 12th allows the Twins to win the opener of the
3-game set with the Tribe.

Trailing 2-0 with 2 outs in the 9th and an 0-2 count by Robb Nen, San Diego
scores 3 runs and wins in the 15th, 4-3. Rick Aurilia's throwing error with
2 out allows Phil Nevin to score in the 15th. Barry Bonds belts his 37th
homer, setting a mark for dingers before the All-Star game. Pinch running,
Rickey Henderson steals 3B, snapping a swipe drought of 24 games, his
longest. Rickey will still top 20 steals this year for the 23rd straight time.

2002
The Braves trade OF George Lombard to the Tigers for RP Kris Keller.

The Yankees pound out 19 hits, including 3 HRs, as they defeat the Rockies,
20-10. The Rockies are just the second major-league team to score seven
runs in an inning (4th), but still lose by 10 or more.

2003
During a College World Series contest against Stanford, a pitch strikes Cal
State Fullerton shortstop Justin Turner on the left side of his face as he
attempts to bunt. Adding insult to injury, the future Mets infielder also
suffers a broken ankle on the play when he unsuccessfully tries to avoid
getting hit by the 87-mph fast ball thrown by Matt Manship.

The A's up-end the Rangers, 9-2, behind Miguel Tejada's 5 hits. One of
Tejada's safeties is a HR off starting pitcher Mario Ramos, who is making
his ML debut.

Montreal's Juan Rivera hits 2 homers in a 9-run 2nd inning of slugfest
against the White Sox. His 2nd homer is a grand slam. The Expos need it as
they win, 17-14. Terrmel Sledge, who comes in as a defensive replacment,
hits a 2-run homer in the 8th to give Montreal some breathing room.

Jason Schmidt of the Giants shuts out the Dodgers, 2-0, limiting LA to 3
hits. In the process, he ends Paul LoDuca's 25-game hitting streak.

The Rockies trade All-Star SS Jose Hernandez to the Cubs in exchange for
IF Mark Bellhorn and minor league P Travis Anderson.

2005
Rafael Palmeiro hits his 560th career HR and Sosa adds a clutch-RBI single
to push the Orioles to a 4-2 win over Colorado. 20-year-old Hayden Penn
(2-0) goes 6 2/3 innings for the win. Manager Lee Mazzilli is thrown out
of the game in the 6th inning for protesting a foul call. He tosses a tray
of bubble gum onto the field and will earn a one-game suspension for it. In
2003 Devil Rays pitcher Jeremi Gonzalez tossed a bucket of sunflower seeds
onto the field and earned no time off. Last year Billy Wagner got a two-game
suspension for tossing a stack of cups and then followed by trying to heave
the water cooler onto the field.

2006
Behind P Jeremy Bonderman, the Tigers beat the Brewers, 3-1. Bonderman
strikes out 12 including six in a row. Prince Fielder's homerun is the only
Brew score.

2007
On the bus ride to Shea Stadium to take on the Mets in an interleague contest,
Twins color commentator Bert Blyleven says he will have his head shaved
if tonight's starter, Johan Santana, throws a complete-game shutout. The
left-hander from Venezuela will shave the broadcaster's head after going
the distance in Minnestoa's 9-0 victory over New York's National League team.

2008
John McLaren is fired as the manager by the Mariners after getting off to a
25-47 start in a season which began with playoff potential. Jim Riggleman, the
team's bench coach, becomes the club's fifth manager in the past six seasons.

In his first minor league appearance, 22-year-old Staten Island Yankee
ambidextrous hurler Pat Venditte Jr, facing the Brooklyn Cyclones at
KeySpan Park in Coney Island, pitches a scoreless ninth inning that includes
striking out a very frustrated Ralph Henriquez to end the game. The unhappy
switch-hitter, after delaying the game to adjust his shin guard each time
he changed batter boxes to gain the advantage of the pitcher throwing with
both hands, is told by the umpiring crew he must first select from which
side of the plate he intended to hit, and that the pitcher would then be
allowed to declare with which arm he would pitch.

2010
The Pirates fire a mascot who participates in an in-game pierogi race due to
the criticism of the team's upper management posted on his Facebook page. The
24-year-old, who will be reinstated by Pittsburgh, is offered a position by
the Washington Wild Things of the Frontier League, an independent baseball
organization, to become one of its racing hot dogs.

2011
After less than one season in the dugout, Edwin Rodriguez unexpectedly resigns
as the manager of the struggling last-place Marlins, who have dropped 17
of 18 contests this month. During his brief tenure with Florida, the first
Puerto Rican-born manager in major league history compiled a 78-86 record
with the team.

2012
Reds hurler Paul Wilson, who is trying to lay down a sacrifice bunt, takes
exception to a pitch that moves inside and glances off the glove of the
catcher. As the ball is retrieved he starts jawing with Kyle Farnsworth
and then mistakenly charges the mound where he is pummeled by the Cubs'
reliever igniting a bench-clearing brawl.

2013
Mark Appel, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 first-year player
draft, is introduced by the Astros at a Minute Maid Park press conference. The
Stanford right-hander, a Houston native and a fan of the team growing up,
will receive a $6.35-million signing bonus, which is significantly less
than the assigned slot value of $7.8 million.

2015
The Orem Owlz, the Rookie Affiliate of the Angels located in Utah, cancels its
"Caucasian Heritage Night" scheduled for August 10 after the event stirred
an outcry on social media. In light of recent racially motivated massacre at
a historic black church in Charleston, SC, the Pioneer League team issued an
apology, stating their intentions have been misconstrued because the goal of
the promotion, like many of their theme nights at Brent Brown Ballpark, was
to make fun of everyday normalcies as evidenced by the planned festivities
that included serving burgers on Wonder Bread with mayonnaise and showing
clips from Seinfeld and Friends about TV characters trying to solve the
vertical leaping challenge.

Alex Rodriguez, after being suspended from baseball last season, becomes the
29th major leaguer to collect his 3,000th hit when he blasts a first-inning
solo homerun to right field off a 95-mph fastball thrown by Detroit ace Justin
Verlander in the team's 7-2 victory at Yankee Stadium. The Bronx Bombers' DH
joins Derek Jeter, the last person to reach the magic number, and Wade Boggs
as the only players to hit a round-tripper to reach the historic milestone.

2017
Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers with his 21st homer against the New York Mets,
became the fastest rookie player in Major League history to reach the mark,
doing so in just 51 career games. He broke the record of 55 games set by
Wally Berger in 1930.

2019
CC Sabathia recorded his 250th career win with a victory against the Tampa
Bay Rays. He became the 48th player to reach this mark.
