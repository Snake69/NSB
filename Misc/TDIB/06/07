1902
At Cleveland, Bill Bernhard (2-0) makes his first start for the Blues
and beats Baltimore and Iron Joe McGinnity, 7-3, his first win for
Cleveland. Bernhard was just acquired from the Philadelphia Athletics for
Frank Bonner and Ossee Schreckengost. He will go 17-5 for Cleveland, to lead
the AL in win percentage, the only pitcher to do so for a 2nd division team
(5th).

1905
At Pittsburgh, Mathewson beats Patsy Flaherty, 5-3, for the Giants. Matty
drives in an insurance run in the 9th with his 2nd hit of the game.

1906
The Cubs score 11 runs in the first inning off Christy Mathewson and Joe
McGinnity enroute to a 19-0 cakewalk in New York. Matty gives up 6 walks,
retiring one batter and Iron Joe leaves after the 2nd inning. Jack Pfiester
allows just three hits as he coasts to the win, the worst beating in
Giants history.

In Washington, Rear Admiral Evans announces that as a result of the actions
by Provincetown, Mass. Selectmen, who have banned Sunday baseball, he is
moving the battleships Maine and Missouri and the cruiser Yankton of the
Atlantic fleet to Rockport, Maine for the summer. The selectmen had initially
endorsed Sunday baseball and then relented because of pressure from preachers
who denounced the practice. A total of 10,000 crew members are involved.

1907
Boston (AL) ships former player-manager Jimmy Collins to the Athletics for
infielder John Knight. Collins guided the team to two pennants but was
suspended last August after he left the team without permission. Boston
buys 43-year-old Deacon McGuire from the Yankees and make him manager.

1908
The Detroit Tigers turn a triple play against the Boston Red Sox for the
2nd day in a row, but Boston wins 9-5. The two tri-killings in two games
is a unique ML-record.

In Chicago's 2-1 10-inning win over Washington, Sox pitcher Nick Altrock
has 12 assists to tie the AL mark set by teammate Walsh.

1909
The Phillies bring back INF Joe Ward for a 2nd tour of duty, buying him
from the Yankees.

1910
In his major league debut, the Phillies' Eddie Stack stops Chicago, 1-0,
on 3 hits. The Cubs sold Stack to the Phils on May 26. Smoke will pitch
three complete-game victories between the 14th and 22nd, but will end the
year at 6-7.

1911
After 2 years on the vaudeville circuit with his wife Mabel Hite, and
occasional sojourns to jail for drunkenness and assault, "Turkey Mike"
Donlin is reinstated by the National Commission. He rejoins the Giants, but
John McGraw's willingness to put up with him ceases after 12 games, and the
.333 lifetime hitter is traded to the last-place NL Boston Rustlers. Today
Donlin doesn't play, but Pirates pitchers have the Giants hitting the ball
on the ground all day. Pittsburgh has 55 total chances on a ML record 28
assists and 27 putouts. Seven errors help the Giants to a 9-4 win.

In the 7th inning against the Dodgers, Chicago's Heinie Zimmerman and Al
Kaiser both steal home - the only time in history the Cubs have pulled the
feat off. Chicago will swipe home an NL-record 17 times this year.

1912
Mathewson allows 11 hits and 6 runs, but still defeats the Reds, 7-6. George
Suggs takes the loss for Cincy, which now trails New York by 9 1/2 games.

1913
At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees finally win one, 3-2, over the White
Sox. The Yanks are now 10-34.

The Cards and Giants combine for 26 hits with New York emerging with a 9-8
win. Mathewson, the last of 5 New York hurlers, picks up the win against
reliever Sandy Burk.

1915
In a pitching duel at Boston, Smoky Joe Wood of the Red Sox bests White Sox
ace Red Faber, 3-0, and knocks Chicago into 2nd place. Each pitcher allows
4 hits and strikes out 5. Bobby Wallace makes his umpiring debut. Wallace
had been discarded by the Browns and refused an offer from the Cardinals,
but he'll tire of umpiring after the season ends and return to the Browns.

1918
The Indians club six Red Sox pitchers for 13 hits in a 14-7 win. Left fielder
Babe Ruth, with a single and triple, comes in to pitch the 7th and walks
his only two batters. The two come around to score the tying and winning
run, handing Ruth (4-5) his 5th loss of the year. The Indians also swipe
7 bases, including a triple steal in the 7th inning led by Braggo Roth,
the 2nd he's led. The battery is Vincent Molyneaux and Wally Schang.

1921
The only game canceled because of a murder occurs at Kingsport, TN
(Appalachian League), when the body of a slain girl is found at the
ballpark. To prevent the trail from becoming confused for bloodhounds,
police close the park and cancel the game against Knoxville.

1923
John McGraw ships P Jesse Barnes and C Earl Smith to the Braves for P Mule
Watson and C Hank Gowdy.

1925
The Reds and Braves turn 5 double plays apiece in a 12-inning game for a
ML record. The Giants and Reds will match it in a 16-inning game on May 1,
1955. The AL record is 9 twin killings, set two weeks ago by Detroit and
Washington ... it will be matched by a number of teams.

1926
The Cubs send two players and cash to Indianapolis for infielder Henry
Schreiber and former major leaguer Riggs Stephenson. Stephenson was in the
minors after a college football injury resurfaced, limiting his throwing
ability. Stephenson is a steal, hitting .319 or better in eight of his nine
seasons with Chicago and leading the club in hitting six times. His .336
with Chicago will be the club's high mark.

1927
The Cubs send Jimmy Cooney and Tony Kaufmann to Philadelphia for pitcher
Hal Carlson. Carlson will go 12-8 for the Cubs the rest of the way.

At New York, Ruth and Gehrig clout back-to-back homers in the 4th inning,
off Al "Tommy" Thomas, to beat the White Sox, 4-1, and increase the Yanks
lead over Chicago to 2 games. Pat Collins also homers for NY, while Bud
Clancy matches for Chicago.

At Philadelphia, the Browns outhit the A's 18-14, but lose 11-9. Both
starters, Rube Walberg and Milt Gaston, are knocked out in the 3rd, but
when Gaston is lifted he bypasses the dugout and leaps into the stands to
punch a spectator who has been riding him. The police escort him from the
field. Cobb has 3 runs and a stolen base for the A's, while George Sisler
has 3 steals and is 4 for 4 for the Browns.

1928
At Cleveland, Joe Shaute pitches credible ball, allowing an early homer to
Tony Lazzeri, but in the 8th he gives up 4 unearned runs. Then in the 9th
he serves up back-to-back homers to Ruth (#20) and Gehrig (#12). The Babe's
is a 3-run shot. Cleveland loses, 8-2, with George Pipgras winning his 10th.

The Robins beat the Reds, 1-0, in 11 innings as both starters go all the
way allowing 11 hits. Bill Doak is the winner over Pete Donohue.

The Phils end their 9-game losing streak stopping the Cubs, 4-2. Ray Benge
goes all the way for the win, giving up a homer to Hack Wilson in the
9th. Wilson now has 10 homers to tie Bissonette for the NL lead.

The Giants nose out the Cardinals, 4-3, to regain 2nd place, but lose CF
Edd Roush for the season when he tears an abdominal muscle diving for a
ball. The injury will plague him the rest of his career. The win goes to
Larry Benton (9-2).

1929
Babe Ruth enters New York's St. Vincent's Hospital for treatment for a cold,
and a heart murmur is discovered. The Babe is ordered to rest and will be
out of action for two weeks. Without Ruth, the Indians cuff the Yankees,
7-3, sending them into 3rd place. Joe Sewell hits a 3-run homer in the 1st
and Ed Morgan follows with a roundtripper.

1930
The White Sox light up Lefty Grove for 7 hits and knock the A's undefeated
ace out of the box in the 2nd inning enroute to a 6-5 win. The loss goes
to Rommel in relief.

1931
With Sunday baseball still prohibited in Philadelphia, the A's make a
one-day trip to Detroit. They win 12-2, and leave 18 men on base.

1932
Pitcher Jack Quinn, at 47, becomes the oldest player to have an extra-base
hit and bat in a run, as his Dodgers beat the Cubs, 9-2. His double is good
for three runs.

Waite Hoyt is unconditionally released by the Dodgers.

1933
Cleveland GM Billy Evans fires manager Roger Peckinpaugh and hires
Walter Johnson to take over. Bibb Falk manages for one game until Johnson
arrives. Johnson's contract is for this year and next.

The Senators and Athletics play to a slugfest 13-13 tie. Jimmie Foxx hits
a 3-run homer in the 8th to tie the match at 11 apiece, offsetting homers
by Bluege and Berg. Connie Mack inserts Bobby Combs, a rookie from Duke
University and nephew of Jack, in the 10th and the Nats promptly score the
go-ahead run off him. The A's put a man on in the bottom of the 10th and
then, with Foxx at-bat, the rains wash it away. Young Combs will make his
official debut tomorrow.

1934
Big Jim Weaver pitches a 1-0 victory for the Cubs over the Cardinals,
topping Bill Hallahan. Weaver, a 25-game winner at Newark in 1933, was
sold to the Browns by the Yankees, but cash-poor St. Louis returned him to
Newark. The Cubs picked him up in mid-May for $12,500.

Len Koenecke hits a leadoff homer off George Darrow for the only score of
the game as Brooklyn beats the Phillies, 1-0.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants score 6 runs in the 8th to whip the Boston
Braves, 14-5. Johnny Vergez collects a homerun and double in the inning,
while Ott clouts 2 homers and drives home 4 runs in the game.

1935
Behind Roy Parmelee's pitching, the Giants squeeze by the visiting Braves,
3-2, in 10 innings. Mel Ott homers in the 9th to tie, and Bill Terry drives
in the winning run in the 10th off Ben Cantwell. Giants LF Joe Moore hits
in his 11th straight game.

1936
George Selkirk's HR in the 16th gives the Yankees Red Ruffing a 5-4 win over
Oral Hildebrand of the Indians. Ruffing has 3 hits, including a HR. Both
starters finish the game but neither record a strikeout, an American
League record.

1938
At Fenway, umpire Bill McGowan - who had tossed Johnny Allen on Opening Day
- orders the Cleveland pitcher to cut off part of a shirt sleeve which is
dangling as he pitches, distracting the batter. The Lenoir, North Carolina
native refuses and walks off the mound. He is fined $250 by Cleveland manager
Oscar Vitt, who makes a pitching change to avoid a forfeit. The Indians
win the game, 7-5. Tribe owner Alva Bradley hurries to Boston and buys the
shirt for $250. The shirt is then displayed at Higbee's Department Store,
owned by Bradley's brother. The shirt later makes its way to the Hall of
Fame museum in Cooperstown, NY.

1939
With Joe DiMaggio back in CF after an absence of 35 games because of a foot
injury, the Yankees roll to a 5-2 win over the White Sox. DiMaggio knocks in
the Yanks' first run with a triple and scores another in New York's three-run
5th. Yankee nemesis Thornton Lee leaves the game with a torn muscle in his
left shoulder after 5 1/3 innings, while New York's starter, Lefty Gomez,
goes 7 innings before wilting in the heat. New York's lead over the idle
Red Sox is now 9 games.

After the Phils release Chuck Klein, Pittsburgh signs the former triple
crown winner, and he hits .300 in 85 games. Klein will return to Philley
after the season.

1940
With the Cardinals starting badly (14-24), owner Sam Breadon fires Ray
Blades as manager. Bill Southworth is brought back from Rochester to replace
him. Mike Gonzales is the interim manager until Southworth arrives.

After 9 straight wins, Bucky Walters suffers his first defeat as the Dodgers
beat the Reds, 4-2, in 11 innings.

1941
The Yankees scores 5 in the 9th to beat host St. Louis 11-7. DiMaggio has
3 hits and King Kong Keller belts a grand slam to back reliever Charley
Stanceau.

The Cards regain the NL lead by pounding out 19 hits and beating the Giants,
11-3. Jimmy Brown, Coaker Triplett and Terry Moore each collect four hits.

1944
Tiger southpaw Hal Newhouser walks nine in six innings, a contributing
factor in the 3-1 loss to the White Sox at Comiskey Park. 'Prince Hal',
a future Hall of Famer, will average nearly 4.5 base on balls per nine
innings during the season.

At Racine (All-American Girls Baseball League), Racine runs by Minneapolis,
11-5. Racine 3B Maddy English steals 6 bases, and her teammates swipe
another 18.

1945
Van Lingle Mungo and the Giants beat Brooklyn, 10-5, with a little help
from Da Bums, who make 8 errors.

1946
One hour before game time, Pirates players vote 20-16 in favor of a walkout
rather than play against the Giants, in order to gain recognition of the
American Baseball Guild. To strike, however, requires a two-thirds majority
and so the walkout does not occur. Aims of organizer Robert Murphy are not
exactly stated, but goals are sometimes identified as a minimum salary of
$7,500, arbitration of salary disputes, and players sharing in 50 percent
of any sale price. The Pirates top the Giants, 10-5.

Cubs pitcher Claude Passeau wins his own game with a 2-run game-ending
homer in the 9th inning against Brooklyn. Chicago wins, 2-0.

1948
The Braves Jim Russell hits one HR batting lefty and another batting righty,
the second National Leaguer to do so, in a 9-5 win over the Cubs. He also
hits 2 doubles and drives in 5 runs. Playing for the Dodgers on July 26,
1951, he'll hit another pair from each side of the plate, the first player
to do so twice. Reliever Red Barrett is the winner over McCall, the first
of four Cubs pitchers. The Cubs do stop Tommy Holmes 17-game hit streak.

The Phils' Dutch Leonard knuckles down the Cards, 5-1, dropping St. Louis
into 2nd place. Dick Sisler homers for the Phils, while Musial's homer is
the only Cards tally.

The Giants take over first place, pounding the Pirates for 13 hits, 9 for
extra bases, to win, 9-5. The Giants score 2 runs in each of the 8th and 9th
innings to win. Wes Westrum and Bobby Thomson homer, while Whitey Lockman
adds a pair of triples. Larry Jansen (7-0) starts, but is not around for
a decision.

1950
The Red Sox compile 42 total bases in their 20-4 bashing of the Browns.
Junior Stephens and Clyde Vollmer each have 2 HRs and 5 RBI for the Red Sox
at Fenway. The Bosox tally 5 homers and 23 hits in their total. Joe Dobson
is the winner. The Fenway fireworks will continue tomorrow when Boston adds
insult to injury beating St. Louis, 29-4.

1952
Sam Jethroe hits the last grand slam in the history of the Boston Braves,
as the Braves win the 2nd game of a doubleheader, 7-6.

1954
Dodger C Roy Campanella, who hit a homerun earlier in the game, steals home
in the 12th in a 7-5 victory over St. Louis.

1955
The White Sox reacquire speedster CF Jim Busby from the Senators for C
Clint Courtney, OF Johnny Groth and P Bob Chakales.

1956
The Red Sox strand a near-record 17 base runners, including 13 in the first
5 innings, but finally beat the Tigers, 6-5 in 10 innings. Mickey Vernon's
4th hit drives in the winner. The Millionaires collect 18 hits, 4 walks,
and an error and a hit batsman.

1957
Phillies rookie Jack Sanford strikes out 13 Cubs to win 1-0.

1961
The O's trade OF Gene Stephens to the A's for 1B Marv Throneberry.

The Twins lose to the Yankees, 5-1, for their 13th straight loss. They'll
win tomorrow but will reach 14 losses in a row in 1982. Ralph Terry allows
the Twins a run in the 1st on 2 hits, then pitches hitless ball for the
next 8 innings. Berry and Mantle homer off Pascual in the 3rd for a record
setting 31 homers in the last 16 consecutive games.

1962
The 1st-place Giants have their lead cut to a half-game over the Dodgers
when Billy Pierce loses his 1st game of the year. The little lefty had won
7 straight before the Cubs top him, 4-3.

1964
Deron Johnson again leads the Reds to a win over the Cards as he collects
a homer, double and 3 singles. The Reds win, 11-6.

1966
Bob Gibson (6-5) ties the ML record with 4 strikeouts in one inning (4th),
but the St. Louis ace is gone by the end of a 9-1 loss at Pittsburgh. The
Bucs nick him for 11 hits and 5 runs in 7+ innings.

The New York Mets, picking first in the June free-agent draft, pass up
Arizona State OF Reggie Jackson to select C Steve Chilcott. Chilcott will
retire after 6 years in the minors and will be the only number-one pick to
never play in the major leagues. The A's take Jackson with the 2nd pick.

1967
At Crosley Field, Reds P Gary Nolan strikes out 15 Giants, including Willie
Mays 4 times. But he still loses, 4-3. Willie McCovey belts a 3-run homer in
the 8th to tie the game, and reliever Bob Lee allows the last run to score to
pin the loss on Nolan. This is the 11th one-run game in a row for the Reds,
a ML record. They won 7 of them. The closest any team has come to matching
the Reds is Brooklyn in 1927, the Cardinals in 1920 and the Giants in 1910.

The last-place Yankees have the first pick in the free-agent draft and use
it to take Ron Blomberg. With the next pick, the Cubs tap SS Terry Hughes,
who will have just 86 ML at-bats. All 20 first-round picks are high school
players, and only 11 will eventually reach the major leagues, including
John Mayberry (#6, Astros), Jon Matlack (#7, Mets), Wayne Simpson (#8,
Reds), Ted Simmons (#10, Cards) and Bobby Grich (#20, Orioles). The O's
take Don Baylor with their 2nd pick, then in the secondary phase, select
P Mike Adamson. Adamson will leap directly to the O's, debuting July 1,
the first player in draft history to bypass the minors. Other selections
today include Dusty Baker (26th round, Braves), Jon Matlack (1st round,
Mets), Steve Yeager (3rd round, Dodgers) and Richie Zisk (3rd round,
Pirates). The Phils strike out as none of their picks will reach the majors.

The Phils and Braves swap catchers, with Bob Uecker going to Atlanta for
Gene Oliver.

1968
A's Blue Moon Odom's bid for a no-hitter is spoiled by Davey Johnson,
who singles with two outs in the 9th inning. Odom tops Baltimore, 6-1.

The 8th place Yankees split a doubleheader with the Angels. New York wins
the opener and California takes the nitecap, 8-4. Tomorrow's game will be
postponed because of the memorial to the slain Bobby Kennedy.

1969
The Washington Senators name Jeff Burroughs the number one pick in the June
free-agent draft. The Astros choose J. R. Richard as the 2nd pick, and
the White Sox follow with 3B Ted Nicholson. Cincinnati picks Ken Griffey
in the 29th round, while Kansas City, with a record 90 picks, takes Al
Cowens with their 84th choice. The Dodgers select Bill Seinsoth in the
first round after selecting him on the 6th round in 1968. The promising
lefty slugger is killed in a car accident in September. With the 13th pick,
the Red Sox take University of Minnesota's Noel Jenke, who is also drafted
by the Chicago Black Hawks and the Minnesota Vikings (12th round). He'll
never make the majors (Pawtucket in 1971 is the highest) but he will play 4
years in the NFL. Montreal picks Tony Scott in the 71st round and Al Cowens,
who will play for 13 years in the majors, lasts until the 75th round (Royals).

1970
Pinch hitter Vic Davalillo of the Cardinals, in for Bob Gibson, gets a
record-tying 2 hits in the 7th inning of a 10-7 win over the Padres. The
Birds score 7 in the frame after the Padres had built a 7-1 lead against
Gibson. Ron Herbel, the 2nd of 4 pitchers in the 7th, is the loser. Davilillo
assumes he receives credit for 2 pinch hits, and that his 23rd pinch hit
on August 31st ties the record of Dave Philley. He will finish the year
with 24 pinch safeties but a rule difference between the AL and NL will
cost him a pinch hit today.

The rampaging Reds move to 9 games ahead in the NL West with a 10-2 walloping
of the Mets. Johnny Bench, with 5 RBIs, and Lee May crash homers to back
Wayne Simpson's 8th win.

1971
The Brewers trade Danny Walton to the Yankees for prospects Bobby Mitchell and
Frank Tepedino. Walton hit 17 HRs in 1970, but is hitting just .203 this year.

1972
The Pirates outslug the Padres 12-5, in the 1st game of a doubleheader, then
take the nitecap, 1-0, in 18 innings. Gene Alley draws a bases-loaded walk
from Corkins, who took over from Kirby in the 14th. The Bucs load the sacks
after Oliver and Stargell reach on infield hits, and then execute a double
steal. Maz is then intentionally walked. Stargell drives in 5 runs in game 1.

1973
The Rangers make Texas high school P David Clyde the number-one pick in the
free-agent draft. He will make his ML debut later this month. U of Minnesota
star Dave Winfield, the number 4 pick (Padres), will also go straight to
the ML. Winfield was also taken in the ABA (Utah), NBA (Atlanta) and NFL
(Minnesota) drafts. John Stearns is taken 2nd by the Phillies, and the
Brewers, picking 3rd, take Robin Yount. Randy Scarbery becomes the first
player selected twice in the first round of the regular phase of the draft
when the A's take him 23rd. The Astros picked him first in 1970, but he
chose college instead. Eddie Bane, 41-4 in his collegiate career, is taken
11th overall by the Twins, who sign him to a club-record bonus. He debuts
a week after David Clyde. The Reds have a 3rd straight draft in which they
come up short, this time selecting California prep OF Brad Kessler with
their 1st choice.

The Yankees trade 3 players - 1B Frank Tepedino, OF Wayne Nordhagen and
a player to be named - to the Atlanta Braves for P Pat Dobson. Dobson had
struggled in his one year in Atlanta after the Braves had acquired him from
the Orioles. The player to be named will turn out to be 2 - Alan Closter
and Dave Cheadle. The Yanks also purchase 30-year-old Sam McDowell (1-2)
from the San Francisco Giants for $100,000+. McDowell, who will later admit
to a drinking problem (teammate Dick Radatz later remarked, "We thought he
was just stupid. It turned out he was never sober.") will pitch 2 seasons
in New York before being released.

1974
The Giants top Pittsburgh 6-2, dropping the last-place Pirates' record to
18-32, nine games out of first place.

At Comiskey Park, a popcorn machine catches fire in the RF stands, delaying
the game 70 minutes and sending fans fleeing for safety. The Sox then pop
Boston, 8-6.

1975
After an outstanding collegiate career at the University of La Verne,
Royals scout Rosey Gilhousen signs Dan Quisenberry as an undrafted free
agent. During his 10-year tenure with Kansas City, the right-handed reliever
saves 238 games, leading the American League for five seasons.

In Cincinnati, the Reds beat the Cubs, 7-1, and take over first place in
the NL West.

1976
In a 5-4 Pirates win over the Reds, the two teams combine for 7 solo
homers. Morgan (2) and Rose homer for Cincy while Oliver, Stargell, Zisk
and Bill Robinson go deep for the host Pirates.

1977
The White Sox select Harold Baines with the number-one pick in the
draft. Bill Veeck had first seen Baines play Little League ball and had
followed his career. P Bill Gullickson is taken with the 2nd pick by the
Expos, and Milwaukee takes University of Minnesota infielder Paul Molitor
with the 3rd pick. Danny Ainge, a potential pro basketball player, is picked
in the 15th round. The Reds come up empty with the 8th pick in round 1,
picking prep 3B Ted Venger. The Expos pick Tim Raines in the 5th round.

1979
Texas slugger John Ellis drives in 6 runs to lead the Rangers to a 7-1
win over Milwaukee. Ellis has 2 homers and a double to back Fergie Jenkins
win. John Grubb singles in the 9th to extend his hitting streak to 20 games.

Charlotte's Mike Boddicker sets a Southern League record with 18 strikeouts
in an 8-2 win over Knoxville.

1980
Yankee pitcher Tommy John posts his 200th victory, a two-hit 1-0 win over
Seattle.

1981
Andre Dawson's 4th inning single is Montreal's only hit off Bruce Berenyi
as the Reds win, 2-0, at Riverfront.

1982
Steve Garvey becomes only the fifth player in major league history to play
in 1,000 consecutive games. The Dodger first baseman goes hitless in four
at-bats in a 4-3 home loss to the Braves.

The O's Jim Palmer tops the Brewers, 7-2, giving up 5 hits, to even his
record at 3-3. Palmer will win his next 9 games.

Consecutive HRs by Minnesota's Ron Washington, Tom Brunansky (off Creel)
and Kent Hrbek (off Quisenberry) in the 8th help the Twins tie, but Kansas
City wins in 10 innings, 5-4.

The Cubs select SS Shawon Dunston, who batted .790 this season for
Brooklyn's Thomas Jefferson HS, with the first pick in the annual June
free-agent draft. The Blue Jays then squander the 2nd pick on SS Augie
Schmidt; he'll be the first Gold Spike winner in 21 years not to make the
majors. The Twins, picking 4th overall, take lefty Brian Oeklers, who will
be the first to reach the majors. Dwight Gooden is the 5th overall, taken
by the Mets, one of 12 Mets draft picks who will make the Bigs. The Red Sox
with 3 first round picks, use their first on Sam Horn and their last 1st
round choice on FSU slugger Jeff Ledbetter, who hit an NCAA record 42 HRs
... at least Horn will make the majors. The Yankees select high school SS Bo
Jackson in the 2nd round, but he opts for Auburn instead. The Angels also go
for a 2-sport star, taking U of Vermont's Kirk McCaskill, the first college
player taken in last years NHL draft. The A's pick Jose Canseco in the 15th
round and sign him for $15,000; the Royals mine gold on the 19th round by
taking Bret Saberhagen. The Reds strike out in the first round when they
select Illini high schooler Scott Jones, but fare better with 9th rounder
Tom Browning. The Rangers take 139-pound HS SS Kenny Rogers in the 39th round.

Facing Wichita State, with a NCAA record 333 stolen bases on the season,
Miami pulls off the "grand illusion," which makes every sports show in the
country. Down 4-3 in the 6th, the Shockers put Phil Stephenson, holder of the
NCAA mark 87 steals this year, on 1B. After throwing over to 1B once, Miami
P Mike Kasprzak takes his foot off the rubber, and seemingly fires again to
1B. Stephenson dives back again, and 1B Steve Lusby leaps over him for the
apparent errant throw. The 2B and RF chase after the ball. Bullpen pitchers
get out of the way of the ball. As Stephenson takes off for 2B, Kasprzak
tosses the ball to SS Bill Wrona for the easy tag. In the championship game
a few days later, a spooked Shocker team will steal just one base in a 9-3
loss to Miami.

1983
Steve Carlton overtakes Nolan Ryan as baseball's all-time strikeout leader,
fanning 6 batters in a 2-1 loss to the Cardinals to bring his career total
to 3,526. In Houston, Ryan strikes out 3 Giants while getting no decision
in the Astros' 4-2 win, leaving him with 3,525.

1985
Behind the pitching of Rick Sutcliffe, the Chicago Cubs defeat the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 1-0, and move into first place in the NL East as the Mets lose. Cubs
catcher Jody Davis accounts for the only run with a homer off Jose DeLeon.

1986
Amos Otis and Steve Busby are honored during a pre-game ceremony as they
become the first inductees into the newly created Royals Hall of Fame.

University of Arkansas' Jeff King, The Sporting News college player of the
year, is the first choice in the June draft. The Pirates take the third
baseman. U of Texas P Gregg Swindell is the next pick by Cleveland. Neither
