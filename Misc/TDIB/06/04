1901
In a 7-3 victory over the host Reds, Brooklyn's Jimmy Sheckard is called out
at 2B by umpire Cunningham - who is definitely having a bad week - and curses
him so vehemently that he is slapped with a $5 fine by the ump. Cunningham
returns to home plate and Sheckard follows, spitting in his face. Cunningham
calls the cops and Sheckard is removed by the police. Cunningham later says,
"I don't know what kept me from pitching into Sheckard but if a player ever
does that to me again I'll pick up a bat and smash him. That's the limit
and the players can take warning." Brooklyn's win is helped by the pitching
of the Reds Barney McFadden who gives up 11 hits and 11 base on balls.

1902
The Boston Americans buy two pitchers - George Prentiss and Bert Husting -

up a victory as New York rallies to win, 9-6.

after 11 wins. Bill Doak is the winner and Hornsby leads the Cards' offense
with 2 triples over the left fielder's head. After the game Alexander calls
Hornsby "the greatest hitter I've ever had to face. I have tried to fool
him every way possible, but it just cannot be done." Alex will be 27-14
for the 5th-place Cubs, and his 1.91 ERA will be the only one under 2.00.

1921

doubleheader win over the Dodgers, 3-0 and 6-4.

berates his teammates in the dugout in full view of the fans and writers. Rip
Collins and Joe Medwick start arguing back and Frisch and Pepper Martin step
in before any fights start. Dean shows his frustration by lobbing the ball
in to Pittsburgh batters and finally leaves in the 7th to a smattering of
boos with the Cardinals down, 9-3. They score a pair to lose, 9-5.

1936
The Tigers score 10 runs in the 3rd and 6 in the 5th enroute to a 18-9
thrashing of the A's. Philadelphia scores 6 in the 9th but still comes up a
bit short. Mickey Cochrane belts an inside-the-park grand slam in the 3rd and
collapses after running it out and is replaced. Manager Cochrane will not be
in the lineup as a player until July 15. Eldon Auker goes the distance for
Detroit and might have had a shutout except for 4 errors. The A's misplay 6.

Coming in as a reliever, Cards P Paul Dean loses for the 1st time to the
Dodgers. The final is 4-3.

ball he continues on to 3B, while Sayles shakes his head at how slow his

distribute 15,000 lucky rabbits feet for Beat Eddie Lopat Night. Lopat
recalled later, "While I was warming up, before the game, a drunk came on
the field and threw a black cat at me and it clung to my uniform jersey." It

Kennedy homer - on the way to an 8-2 win. It is Lopat's first defeat to

number-one pick and sign him in 3 days to a $100,000 contract. He'll play
in the ML 11 years but catch only 9 games in the Bigs because of a phobia
about throwing the ball back to the pitcher. Choosing next, the Indians
take Stanford P Steve Dunning, who will debut in 10 days. He's just the
2nd player drafted who will skip the minors. Catchers Barry Foote (Expos)
and Darrell Porter (Brewers) go next. The Pirates wait till the 14th round
to take Dave Parker. Rich Gossage goes in the 9th round to the White Sox;

water while celebrating West Palm's FSL win in 1977. The Expos finally pick

victory thanks to third baseman Ken Reitz' extra inning solo homerun.

The Yankees, with no picks in rounds one and two, select 18-year-old
Billy Cannon Jr with their 3rd round pick. After protests from at least 2
other teams, Bowie Kuhn rules that all the teams but the Yankees had been
misled by a telegram sent by Bill Cannon Sr, saying his son was going to
play football. A special draft (excluding the Yanks) in August is won
by the Indians, who offer the young gun $275,000. But Cannon elects to
play football at Texas A&M. Following in the footsteps of his Heisman dad,
Cannon will be the number 1 pick of the Cowboys in 1984, but a neck injury
curtails his career.

1986
In a 12-3 rout of the Braves, Pirates rookie outfielder Barry Bonds goes 4

before leaving in the 7th because of a foot blister. The Jays then score
2 in the 7th, 4 in the 8th and 5 in the 9th, and 2 more in the 11th on
Junior Felix' HR. It is the biggest lead the Red Sox have ever blown and
their 12th consecutive loss to the Blue Jays at Fenway.

1990
The Dodgers' Ramon Martinez, 22, strikes out 18 Braves in a 2-0 win. He
ties Sandy Koufax' club record and is one short of the NL mark. Martinez
whiffed none in the 9th inning.

The Braves wisely select Florida high school SS Chipper Jones with the first
pick in the annual free-agent draft. The Tigers follow with Tony Clark,
and the Phils use the 3rd pick on Mike Lieberthal. The A's use their 14th
choice to take the much sought after Todd Van Poppel, passed over because of
his stated intention to pitch at the University of Texas. The A's change his
mind and he signs on July 16th for $1.2 million. Picking 20th, the Orioles
take Stanford's Mike Mussina. Late in the 6th round, the independent Class
A Miami Miracle drafts Mike Lansing under a never-before-used rule. The
rule will be abolished, but Lansing will play two years with the Miracle
and make the majors with the Expos. Troy Percival (Angels) and Mike Hampton
(Mariners) go in the 6th round, Rusty Greer (Rangers) in the 10th, and in
the 12th round, the Twins take SS Pat Meares. The White Sox end up with the
best draft, taking Alex Fernandez (1st round), Bob Wickman (2nd), Robert
Ellis (3rd), James Baldwin (4th), Ray Durham (5th), Brandon Wilson (18th)

1996
Greg Jefferies celebrates his return to the Phillies lineup by going 4 for

Pitching dominates the baseball draft as 14 of the first 22 selections
are moundsmen. Clemson pitcher Kris Benson is the top choice, going to
Pittsburgh where he'll snag a $2 million signing bonus, while the Twins
pick power-hitting Travis Lee from San Diego State as the 2nd choice. The
Cards follow with Wichita State P Braden Looper. Picking 14th, the White
Sox take lefty Bobby Seay, but will declare him a free agent in August
when they can't reach an agreement with his agent, Steve Boras. Travis Lee,
John Patterson (Expos) and Matt White (Giants) will also not sign and become
free agents because of a loophole discovered by Scott Boras. The agent says
that the letters tendered are not offers on specific forms and that only
the latter can be used within 15 days of drafting or the players are free
agents. The four will ink contracts with the Devil Rays and Diamondbacks,
with White getting a $10.2 million bonus, the largest in history. The Marlin
use their 1st pick, 9th overall, on college player of the year, Mark Kotsay,
and will ink him to a $1,125,000 contract. The Royals take high schooler
Dee Brown in the first round. The Cubs use #17 on pitcher Todd Noel, and

.215 and .211 in Class A in 1996-97 before returning to college football
and then quarterbacking for the Dallas Cowboys. Boston picks Shea Hildebrand
in the 10th round; he'll be the 1st Sox rookie since Ted Williams to start
his career with a 9-game hit streak. Texas takes Travis Hafner in the
31st round. Paul Wilder is selected as the Devil Rays' first-ever draft
pick. The 18-year outfielder-first baseman, who tops the huge list of 97
players chosen by Tampa Bay, will spend four years in the minor leagues
without ever appearing in a major league game.  

Pam Davis, a starter for the Colorado Bullets women's baseball team, pitches
an inning of scoreless relief in a AA exhibition game. Davis relieves for the

three batters. Davis is the first woman to pitch for a major league farm club.

1997

O's Chris Hoiles has two RBIs and Cal Ripken, showing no effects from signing
(a major-league record?) 2200 copies of his new book after last night's game,

a.m. The Orioles extend their winning streak to seven games and move 9 1/2

Jones in the 2nd inning. Yan's HR is on the 1st pitch he sees in his 1st
major league at-bat. He's the 77th MLer to hit a HR on his 1st at-bat, and

their team record for biggest loss, tying the mark set in a 21-0 loss to the
Tigers, on September 15, 1901. The Tribe also becomes the first team since

Giants All-Star closer Armando Benitez, which ties the game in the tenth,

field in the 11th inning high fives some Shea Stadium fans in the front
row much to the displeasure to many players in both dugouts.

At Camden Yards, the Orioles play Small ball, cuffing Aaron Small for 7

No. 17 overall by Houston in 1994.
