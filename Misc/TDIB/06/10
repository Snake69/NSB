1901
The Brooklyn-Colts game draws only 450 fans in Chicago as the visitor
win, 9-1.

In Cincinnati, Boston's Vic Willis is victorious over the Reds, 9-5. Willis
hits his only career homer, off Doc Newton, to help his win. His batterymate
Kittredge also homers. Noteworthy at the game is AL prexy Ban Johnson,
who is the guest of Reds owner John Brush.

At Washington, the Washington Senators overcome an 8-run deficit in the 8th
to tie the game at 10-10 with the White Sox. Clark Griffith pops out as a
pinch hitter in the 9th but stays on to pitch for the Sox. In the top of
the 10th, Hoy, who earlier homered, singles to start the inning. Two outs
later Frank Isbell walks and Fred Hartman homers to end the scoring, 13-10.

1902
Bobby Wallace, slick-fielding St. Louis SS, handles an AL record 17 chances
in a 9-inning game while losing 5-4 to Boston. Wallace, whose 25-year
career will place him in the Hall of Fame, has 11 assists and 6 putouts,
but makes 2 errors.

Led by Erve Beck, the Reds roll over Bill Duggleby and the Phillies,
10-1. Beck has 5 hits, including a pair of triples. Ewing is the victor.

1903
Detroit SS Kid Elberfeld, suspended for abusing an umpire, is traded to
the New York Highlanders for veteran infielders Herman Long, 37, and Ernie
Courtney. The Highlanders' first trade is a good one as "The Tabasco Kid",
currently hitting .341, will be a key ingredient in New York's rise as
contenders in 1904. Elberfeld had also been accused by Tiger manager Ed Barrow
of deliberately throwing games recently as a ploy to get himself traded.

1904
In the opener of the battle for first place at the Polo Grounds, Christy
Mathewson pitches a brilliant one-hitter to beat Chicago, 5-0. The lone
hit is Johnny Kling's 4th-inning single. The other action is provided by
ump Charlie Zimmer, who ejects Mertes on a strike call. He also thumbs John
McGraw, coaching at 3B, to the bench, and sends Dummy Taylor, the 1B coach,
to the clubhouse. One wag said later that Taylor was making too much noise.

It is Ladies Day in Boston, and the Pirates start Patsy Flaherty, recently
re-acquired from the White Sox, where he led the AL in losses in 1903
(25). Patsy wins his first start with the help of Honus Wagner, who is 3
for 5 with two doubles, three runs and two steals.

1905
The host Athletics outslug the Tigers, 15-8.

1906
The White Sox manage just one hit off Al Orth but still beat the visiting
Highlanders, 1-0, on an unearned run. In the 3rd inning, 2 errors and a
HBP score the run. Jones has the lone hit, a 6th inning single.

In Memphis on a scouting trip, Connie Mack says that Christy Mathewson's
ineffectiveness can be traced back to a ligament sprain in his last game
pitching against the A's. In the latter part of the game, Matty grasped his
arm after unleashing a fastball. Mack said players on the coaching lines
heard the snap of something resembling the crack of a toy pistol. Mack's
offer of $1700 to Memphis for SS Nicholls was refused.

1908
In the New York Globe writeup of yesterday's 8-2 Giants win over Pittsburgh,
reporter Peter Morris uses the term cup of coffee in referring to a player:
"It isn't often that Hank O'Day is caught napping, but a young player just
getting his cup of coffee in the league put one over on Hank and Mr. Klem
yesterday". According to Paul Dickson, this is the first use of the term.

1909
George Mullin's winning streak reaches 11 with a 2-1 win over New York. On
the 15th, he will finally lose to the Athletics 5-4.

1910
Behind Dixie Walker's one hitter, the Washington Senators edge the White
Sox, 1-0. Unglaub's 9th inning single and steal of 2B is key as Blackburne's
errant throw allows him to score the winner. Doc White's single is the lone
Sox safety.

1911
At Pittsburgh, the Bucs' Bobby Byrne steals 2B, 3B and home in the same
inning against Brooklyn. His swipe of 2B is on the back end of a double
steal with Fred Clarke scoring on a contested play. When Brooklyn C Bill
Bergen and pitcher Doc Scanlon argue the call with Bill Klem, Byrne sneaks
to 3B. Doc Scanlon gets tossed by umpire Bill Klem and the remaining 8
runs are rung up against reliever George Bell. After Dots Miller walks,
he and Byrne pull off another double steal. Up 8-0 in the 8th, Pittsburgh
tries a triple steal, and scores a run on a throwing error. But no steals
are handed out on the play. The final is 9-0.

Washington rolls by the White Sox, 18-7. Ewart Walker, father of Dixie and
Harry Walker, makes his ML debut and collects a single, double and triple
in the win.

The Cubs trade C Johnny Kling, P Orlie Weaver, P Hank Griffin and OF Al
Kaiser to the Boston Doves for C Peaches Graham, P Cliff Curtis, Wilbur
"Lefty" Good and OF Bill Collins. Curtis (1-8), who began the year with 5
straight losses after ending last season with 18 straight defeats, will be
swapped to the Phillies in August.

At Princeton's Commencement day, a crowd of 18,000 watch as Yale beats the
Tigers, 6-2.

1912
The Red Sox beat the Browns, 3-2 and take the AL lead for good, finishing
14 games ahead of Washington.

In the opener with the Giants, the Cubs top the league leaders, 9-8, despite
New York's Chief Meyers hitting for the cycle. The Chief is the first ML
catcher to cycle. Heinie Zimmerman answers with two homers for Chicago.

1913
A bounce homer by Fred Luderus into the RF stands at Redlands Field is
the difference as the Phillies defeat the Reds, 3-2. As noted by Rhodes
and Snyder, Enquirer reporter Jack Ryder writes "the feat was thought
impossible." The ball bounced over a 10-foot high wall 400 feet from home
plate. "There is little chance of another hit like that of Luderus being
made on this field for many seasons."

1918
The Braves' Rudolph fires the 2nd one-hitter in two days, beating Rube
Bressler and the visiting Reds, 3-0. Hal Chase has the lone hit.

1921
Ruth connects for the 120th homer of his career, the blast coming in the
3rd inning against Cleveland's Jim Bagby. The round tripper breaks the
career mark of homerun leader Gavvy Cravath, who totaled 119 in his 11-year
career. Despite the homer, New York loses, 8-6. The 'Sultan of Swat' will
hold the career homerun lead until Hank Aaron hits number 715 in 1974.

1922
The Giants raise their WS pennant on George Burns Day. It's the first
appearance at the Polo Grounds for the popular outfielder, now with the
Reds after 10 years in a Giants uniform. The Giants win, 3-2.

In St. Louis, Babe Ruth's 2-run homer in the 3rd, off Urban Shocker,
ties the game. Shocker then plunks Frank Baker, and a double, single, two
errors on the same play, and sac fly score 4 more. Shocker then sends Carl
Mays sprawling on 3 straight pitches before walking him, and fires his 1st
pitch right at Whitey Witt. The Yanks score 6 off Shocker, and another 6 off
relievers to win, 14-5. A foul fly in the 7th beans St. Louis owner Phil Ball,
sitting behind the dugout. He has a slight concussion and requires 4 stitches.

1927
George Stallings, Rochester (IL) club owner, fires himself as manager.

1929
Pete Alexander, in relief of Clarence Mitchell is hit hard by Philadelphia,
but emerges with a 10-9 Cards win. Chick Hafey leads the Cards' offense
with a 2B, 3B and a HR.

1930
After seven consecutive victories from the start of the season, A's
right-hander Lefty Grove loses in eleven innings to the White Sox, 7-6. The
future Hall of Famer will finish the season 28-5 along with a 2.54 ERA for
the eventual World Champion club.

The A's Lefty Grove loses his first game of the season, 7-6, in 11 innings
to the White Sox. His record is now 7-1.

The PCL sees its first night game when Sacramento hosts Oakland before 10,000
fans at Moreing Field. There are 180,000 watts of light from 40 lamps on
40 poles. By the end of next season every PCL team will have lights. Ed
Bryan turns the lights out on the visitors, winning 5-0.

1931
Rabbit Maranville scores 5 runs in the Braves' 13-4 victory over the
Cardinals.

1933
The Giants never lose the league lead after Freddie Fitzsimmons beats
Philadelphia, 5-2.

He's not there for his hitting. Lefty Grove strikes out 5 times, a ML first
in the 10th century, but his Athletics beat the Yankees, 9-5. Lefty will
hit .086 this year.

1934
Doc Cramer hits for the cycle, but the Yankees still beat the A's 7-3 on
Gehrig's 2nd grand slam of the year.

1935
Paul Waner, Arky Vaughan and Pep Young hit successive HRs in the 8th inning
off Benny Frey in the Pirates 14-1 win against the Reds. Vaughan's homer
is his 2nd of the day as he continues to lead the NL in hitting with a
.400+ average.

1936
The Pirates hand the visiting Dodgers a 6-3 defeat, the 7th loss in a row for
Brooklyn. Though he hasn't pitched since a pounding in Chicago on June 5,
Van Lingle Mungo jumps the team in Pittsburgh, complaining of poor support
and demanding to be traded.

1937
The Senators trade Bobo Newsom (3-4, 5.85, a 17-game winner last year) and
outfielder Ben Chapman (.262, 0, 12) to the Red Sox for the brother battery
of Wes (3-6, 7.61) and Rick Ferrell (.308, 1, 4), as well as outfielder Mel
Almada (.236, 1, 9). Rick, the catcher, will be inducted into the Hall of
Fame in 1984, but his brother Wes, the pitcher, will hit more career homeruns.

1938
Red Sox rookie pitcher Bill Lefebvre homers in his first ML at-bat, on the
first pitch and the only plate appearance for the season, off Monty Stratton
of the White Sox. But 22-year-old southpaw from Natick, RI is hammered
by Chicago in a 15-2 loss. He is the first AL player to homer in his only
season at-bat, and it will be his only ML homer, though he will finish with
a .276 career average and lead the AL in pinch-hits in 1944. Stratton,
the winning pitcher, gets his revenge in the 2nd inning when he connects
for a grand slam off Lefebvre, who gives up 6 runs in 4 innings.

1941
Cardinal starter Lon Warneke yields a single to Phils lead off hitter
Emmett Mueller, then gives up no more safeties as he wins, 3-0. It's the
2nd one-hitter against the Phils in 4 days.

1942
The visiting Giants, behind Bill Lohrman, top the Reds, 3-1. The Reds
only run is a homer by prized rookie catcher Ray Lamanno, one of five Reds
hits. Lonnie Frey has three singles. Lamanno's homer, his 7th, lands on the
roof of a laundry across the street from the left field wall. The Giants
also make five hits in beating Gene Thompson.

1944
P Joe Nuxhall of the Cincinnati Reds is the youngest player in the 20th
century to appear in a game. Nuxhall, only 15-years 10-months old, pitches 2/3
of an inning in an 18-0 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals and Mort Cooper. He
retires the first batter he faces but gives up 5 walks and 2 hits before
Bill McKechnie takes him out. The Cards tie a league record by stranding 18
runners in the most lopsided shutout win in the NL in 10 years. The loser at
the end of the day is Bill Lohrman. Only Jack Chapman, age 14, who appeared
in one game on July 22, 1887, was younger than Nuxhall when he appeared
in a ML game. Unlike Chapman, Nuxhall will return to the majors, in 1952,
and win 135 games. Nuxhall will stay in the Reds organization for over
sixty years, becoming best known as the voice for the team's radio broadcasts.

1949
Frank Frisch, who began the season as coach of the Giants, replaces Charlie
Grimm as manager of the last-place Cubs. Frisch was the first choice of
Grimm, who goes into the front office as a vice president after tomorrow's
games. According to Grimm, "the Cubs have never had a fighting manager of
the Frisch type for forty years. The last manager who'd compare with Frisch
in my book is Frank Chance."

the players present Veeck with a trophy for freeing them from Rajah's
tyranny. The Browns name Marty Marion as their player-manager.

Sam Mele of the White Sox hits a 3-run HR and a 3-run triple in the 4th
inning of a game at Philadelphia, as Chicago romps 15-4. Chicago plates 12
runs, 6 unearned, in the frame.

The Red Sox send pitchers Randy Gumpert and Walt Masterson to Washington
for pitcher Sid Hudson.

1953
RF Jimmy Piersall of the Red Sox goes 6 for 6 (5 singles - 3 infield - and a
double) against 5 different pitchers to tie a ML mark in a 11-2 win over the
Browns in the first game of a doubleheader. The Sox welcome Lanier to the AL
by handing him his first loss. Piersall is hitless in game 2, a 3-2 Sox win,
and gets decked by Satchel Paige. Piersall had infuriated Paige during a
game in his rookie season last year by mimicing the right-hander's every move.

1954
Reds southpaw Fred Baczewski goes the distance blanking Pittsburgh at Crosley
Field, 6-0. 'Lefty', a former college basketball player at the University

but shuts them out, 6-0.

At Milwaukee, Bill Taylor knocks a pinch homerun in the 10th off Gene

6th of 7 decisions against the Braves.

effort by Cleveland's Dick Stigman. The 8th inning solo shot gives New York
a 4-3 win.

Koufax to account for all of Cincy's scoring. They win, 4-3. For Dutch,
it is one of his 5 career dingers and his only slam.

The Red Sox fire manager Billy Jurges, who left the team on June 8 reportedly
because of illness. Del Baker will be the interim manager. Tomorrow, the
Sox will hire Pinky Higgins as the regular manager. It'll be Pinky's second
tour of duty as Sox skipper.

batters. The Buckeyes will lose in the final, 2-1, to Arizona State.

1966
Indian hurler Sonny Siebert throws the only no-hitter of the season
defeating the Senators, 2-0. The right-hander strikes out seven batters,

an Indian since Bob Feller's third career no-hitter, in 1951.

1972
Henry Aaron passes Willie Mays into second place on the all-time home
run list. The Braves' outfielder connects for a grand slam, his 14th to

65 shy of Babe Ruth's total. The Braves defeat the Phillies today, 15-3.

1974
Mike Schmidt collects one of the longest singles in big league history
when the ball he hits off Astros hurler Claude Osteen caroms off the public
address speaker hanging 117 feet in the air and 329 feet from home plate. It
is ruled in play due to the ballpark's ground rules. The Rice University
mathematics department calculates the Astrodome blast would have traveled
550 feet if left unimpeded. The Phillies beat the Astros today, 12-0. Jim
Lonborg is the winner.

1975
The Yankees sponsor Army Day at their temporary home, Shea Stadium (Yankee

The Yankees send former ace Ken Holtzman back to the Cubs, his first team,
in exchange for minor leaguer Ron Davis. Holtzman proved a disappointment
in New York, and he will not recapture his form in Chicago. Davis will
blossom in 1979 when his 14-2 mark sets a record for most wins by a rookie
reliever. The previous mark was 13 wins by Yankee Wilcy Moore.

1981
Phillies 1B Pete Rose singles off Nolan Ryan in the first inning to tie
Stan Musial as the NL's all-time hit leader with 3,630, then strikes out

is Ron Darling (6-3).

1995
Jeff Manto hits his fourth consecutive homerun over three games equaling
Johnny Blanchard's mark established in 1961. The Orioles' rookie third

as the only Yankees to homer in their first at-bat. The Yankees best the
Diamondbacks, 7-5.

of the Red Sox and Jacob Ruppert of Yankees, which sold Babe Ruth to New
York. The cost to purchase the five typed pages is nearly ten times the value
the soon to be 'Bronx Bombers' paid to get the emerging 'Sultan of Swat.'

The Orioles down the Reds, 4-3. The interleague matchup marks the first time
in history that three 500-HR players appear in the same game - Sammy Sosa
(580), Rafael Palmeiro (559) and Ken Griffey Jr, who hit a solo shot in
the eighth inning for No. 511.

In their first meeting since 1918, the Cubs beat the Red Sox, 14-6, at
Wrigley using a 20-hit attack. Winning pitcher Greg Maddux hits his 1st
homer in six years and Jeromy Burnitz hits 2 homers and Todd Hollandsworth
one. David Ortiz has a pair of homers for the Sox. The two teams which
have had the fates influenced by curses last met in the 1918 World Series,
won by Boston behind the solid pitching of Babe Ruth.

The Brewers trade 2B Junior Spivey to the Nationals for P Tomo Ohka.

Terry Mulholland of Minnesota and Mike MacDougal of Kansas City both
throw one pitch and each pockets a loss when that pitch is hit for a home
run. Hee-Seop Choi of the Dodgers hits his 2nd of the game off Mulholland
in the 9th to give LA a 6-5 win. Eric Gagne is the winner as the Dodgers'
relievers retire 21 batters in a row following Morneau's triple in the
3rd. It is the first meeting of the two teams since the 1965 WS. After
blowing an 11-3 lead in the 8th, Troy Glaus of Arizona homers off Mike
MacDougal in the 10th to give Arizona a 12-11 win over Kansas City. The
D'Backs took the lead on Shawn Green's two homers and 5 RBI, but 10 walks
to the Royals help bring them back. Ruben Gotay (HR) and David DeJesus (3B)
each drive in 2 runs in the Royals' 6-run 8th. KC starting pitcher Zack
Greinke hits a homer but they pay him to pitch and he allows 15 hits and 11
runs in 4+ innings, recording just 13 outs. Greinke joins Eppa Rixey (1927),
Bill Sherdel (1931) and Scott Sanders (1998) as the only pitchers to give
up 15 hits while recording 13 outs or fewer in a game (Elias Sports Bureau).

2006
Using a fishing rod with a baseball attached to the hook at the end of a
heavy duty line he designed, Kevin Wirth throws out the ceremonial "First
Cast" from the pitcher's mound before the Louisville Bats and Indianapolis
Indians contest at Slugger Field. The catcher uses a fishing net to capture
the CITGO Bassmaster Elite Series Angler toss at home plate.

In a 9-5 loss to Tampa Bay at Kauffman Stadium Reggie Sanders hits his
300th career homerun off Chad Harville in the ninth. The Royals' outfielder
becomes just the fifth player in major league history with 300 homeruns and
300 stolen bases, joining Barry and Bobby Bonds, Andre Dawson and Willie Mays.

Daniel Cabrera pitches 6 scoreless innings for the Orioles who take a 9-0 lead
into the bottom of the 7th then hold on as the Twins score 7 runs. Michael
Cuddyer hits a grand slam in the Twins' five-run 7th. For the 4th game in
a row Joe Mauer is on base 4 times. Carlos Silva is the losing P but he
does retire the side on three pitches in the 2nd as he did last year in a
74-pitch game.

2007
In addition to the team wearing a dark patch with the word "NUXY" printed in
white on their uniform, the Reds honor broadcaster Joe Nuxhall, along with
Marty Brennaman and Waite Hoyt, with replica microphones which will hang
on the wall near the radio booth. The honor comes on the 63rd anniversary
of the "ol' left-hander" becoming the youngest person ever to play in the
major leagues in the modern era.

2008
Tiger general manager Dave Dombrowski announces the team is optioning
Dontrelle Willis, acquired in an off-season blockbuster trade, to their
Class A minor league team in Lakeland. The former Marlin southpaw was the
2003 National League Rookie of the Year and compiled a 22-10 record with
the Fish just two years later. He recently signed a three-year deal worth
$29 million with Detroit.

The matchup between Greg Maddux and Dodgers' rookie Clayton Kershaw is the
largest gap in career wins between two starters since August 25, 1965 when
San Francisco's Warren Spahn (361 wins) faced the Mets' Darrell Sutherland
(one). Maddux, who was denied his 351st victory, out-pitched the rookie.
Maddux, 42, was winning 18 games in his second full season in the majors
when Kershaw, 20, was born in 1988.

2010
A day after Jim Joyce called Jason Donald safe with two outs in the ninth
inning, who was obviously out, ruining Armando Galarraga's bid for a
perfect game, Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm issues a proclamation
stating the Tigers right-hander indeed pitched a perfect game against
Cleveland, dismissing the blown call by the first base umpire. Additionally,
U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich) reports she is lobbying baseball
commissioner Bud Selig to declare Galarraga's performance a perfect game,
and long-time U.S. Representative John D. Dingell (D-Mich) says he is planning
to introduce a resolution in Congress asking MLB to overturn the call.

Against Toronto, Carlos Pena hits his 129th homerun as a member of the Rays
setting the franchise record. Pena broke the record that was previously
held by Aubrey Huff.

Jonathan Niese pitches a 1-hitter for his first career complete game and
the New York Mets overcome a triple play to beat the San Diego Padres,
3-0, for a double-header split. Niese allows only Chris Denorfia's leadoff
double in the third inning. He faces 28 batters, one more than the minimum,
in New York's first complete game this season.

2011
Tony La Russa manages his 5,000th major league game, a disappointing 8-0
Cardinal loss to Milwaukee at Miller Park. The 66-year-old skipper, whose
33-year managerial career also includes stints with the A's and the White
Sox, is the second manager to reach the milestone but remains far behind
Connie Mack's record of 7,755 contests (over 53 years). La Russa's record
is 2,676-2,320-4.

Michael Acosta, a longtime Twins fan, gets a chance to manage the team
for a day thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The testicular cancer
survivor's big day at Target Field will be featured on a special episode
of ESPN SportsCenter's "My Wish" series.

2012
Bobby Abreu, who was tied with Mickey Mantle for 109th place on the all-time
hit list, surpasses the Yankee legend with a second-inning double in L.A.'s
8-2 interleague victory over Seattle at Safeco Field. The 38-year-old
outfielder has collected 2,416 hits playing for the Astros, Phillies,
Yankees, Angels and Dodgers.

The Red Sox pass the NBA's Portland Trailblazers for the most consecutive
sellouts for a North American pro franchise with their 745th straight
capacity crowd at Fenway Park. The streak, which has featured an average
paid attendance of 36,544 fans, started on May 15, 2003, a year after the
team's new ownership bought the Boston ball club.

The Orioles win their ninth straight extra-inning game when Matt Wieters
lines a one-out RBI double in the 10th to give the club a 5-4 walk-off
victory over Philadelphia at Camden Yards. The streak of overtime victories,
which includes yesterday's 12-inning win, breaks the team's previous record
of 8 which had been accomplished twice.
