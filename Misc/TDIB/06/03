1902
The Cardinals' Mike O'Neill, a pitcher and one of 4 ML brothers, hits the
first pinch grand slam ever in the majors, against Boston Beaneater Togie
Pittinger. It is an inside-the-park HR at Boston's South End Grounds and
scores his brother Jack as the Cardinals win, 11-9. The hurler's ninth
inning blast proves to be the difference. O'Neill becomes the first pitcher
in the NL to hit a grand slam this century.

The Giants' manager, Horace Fogel, leaves the team because of his father's
death, and he will not return. The Giants will replace him with 2B George
Smith on the 11th. The change lasts 6 weeks before Smith goes back to the
infield and John McGraw takes over.

1903
Pirate pitching shuts out the Giants for the 2nd day in a row with Sam
Leever applying the whitewash, 5-0. Pittsburgh scores their first run on a
double steal, with Claude Richey on the front end. Richey tallies 4 hits
off Joe McGinnity to pace the offense. Ginger Beaumont adds a HR to deep
CF in the 5th inning, the same inning in which 3B coach Christy Mathewson
is tossed for kicking dirt on umpire James Johnstone.

1906
At Washington Park, the Superbas successfully challenge the Sunday Blue
Laws by playing under a new voluntary payment plan. Instead of dropping
money in a box, fans hand it to an attendant who seats them in the proper
section. Brooklyn then defeats the Beaneaters, 3-1.

1907
The Cards' Stoney McGlynn pitches both games of a doubleheader with the
Reds, winning a 1-0 five-hitter in the opener. The Reds then rock Stoney
for 7 hits to win the nitecap, 5-1.

1908
Mathewson fans 11 in whipping the Braves, 3-0. Matty is 8-3 but the Giants
are in 5th place.

1910
Jack Warhop allows one hit for the Yankees, but loses to the White Sox,
3-1. Ed Walsh allows 4 singles, drives in 2 runs with a double, and scores
the last run.

1911
In Chicago, Cubs slugger Frank "Wildfire" Schulte hits a grand slam off
Rube Marquard to beat the Giants, 8-4. Schulte will slam four this season,
a record tied by Babe Ruth in 1919 and topped by Ernie Banks' five in
1955. The four this season are Schulte's only grand slams in his 11-year
career. Ed Reulbach picks up the victory.

Led by Cobb's 3 hits, including 2 triples, the Tigers beat the Senators'
ace Walter Johnson, 7-2.

1912
New York's Rube Marquard wins his 11th in a row, clipping the Cardinals,
8-3. Batterymate Chief Meyers helps with a grand slam.

1914
P Chief Johnson jumps from Cincinnati to Kansas City (FL). A judge grants
a permanent injunction against him playing for KC, but he pitches for the
Packers through 1915.

1916
Philadelphia's Pete Alexander shuts out the Cardinals, 2-0. His shutout
is saved when Dode Paskert makes a leaping catch to rob Frank Snyder of a
homerun. Lee Meadows is the loser.

In Cleveland, Tris Speaker drives in 5 runs with two triples and a single
to lead the first-place Indians to an 11-2 win over the Red Sox.

1918
Boston lefty Hub Leonard pitches his 2nd no-hitter, beating the Tigers'
all right-handed lineup in Detroit 5-0, and allowing just a first-inning
walk. Babe Ruth, playing CF for the first time in his career, slugs a
first-inning HR, his 2nd in 2 days. Ty Cobb, out a week with an injured
shoulder, pinch-hits in the 9th and fouls out.

Washington scores in the top of the 9th to beat Cleveland, 3-2, with the
win going to Walter Johnson in relief. Eddie Foster is 0 for 4 against
Coveleski to stop his 21-game hitting streak.

The A's Vean Gregg fires a one-hitter to beat the Browns, 2-1. Catcher Les
Nunamaker has the only safety, a single.

At Brooklyn, the Cardinals outslug the Dodgers, 15-12, in 10 innings. But
the Dodgers play the game under protest after a 6th inning run by Doug Baird
is allowed by umpire Rigler. The baserunner Baird passes 3B, reverses hmself
to head for 2B, reverses again and scores by cutting across the diamond. The
NL will uphold the protest, erasing today's game and Zach Wheat's 0 for 5
at the plate. This, plus the Reds' protested game of April 29, will give
Wheat the batting title over Edd Roush, .335 to .333.

1919
In the Browns big 8-run 5th inning, George Sisler bangs a double off
Cleveland's Tom Phillips. Phillips is still pitching when Sisler bats again
in the inning, and this time he hits a homer off the former Brownie. Sisler
hits another homer in the 7th as the Browns win, 14-6. Cleveland takes the
nitecap, 9-5. Indians 1B Don Johnston is 2 for 3 in game 2, and his out
ends a streak of 9 consecutive hits.

Connie Mack coaxes Harry Davis out of retirement and names him assistant
manager. The long-time A's player-captain last managed the Indians. Mack
also signs veteran Paddy Livingston as pitching coach. Speculation is that
Davis will eventually be the manager, but that will not happen.

1920
Ping Bodie hits a 6th inning grand slam to lead the Yankees to a 5-4 win
over the Athletics. Bob Shawkey, whose indefinite suspension was lifted
today, gives up homers to Walker and Dykes but settles down and pitches a
complete game win.

1921
Crip Polli strikes out 28 batters in a ten-inning contest against Cushing
Academy at Mountaineer Recreation Field in Montpelier, Vermont. The Goddard
Seminary student performance, which is highlighted in Ripley's Believe
It or Not, is no fluke as the high schooler will fan 105 batters in a
five-game span.

The A's bang 7 homers enroute to a 15-7 win over the Tigers. Jimmy Dykes
and Frank Welch each belt 2, while Cy Perkins, Tilly Walker and Joe Dugan
have one apiece. For Detroit, Lu Blue hits his first major league homer,
off Slim Harriss.

At Fenway Park, the Indians score single runs in the 8th and 9th off reliever
Herb Pennock to tie the Sox at 6-6. But pinch-hitter Sammy Vick's single
scores Stuffy McInnis with the winning run in the bottom of the inning.

Playing under the name Lou Lewis, Lou Gehrig makes his professional debut
at first base for the Hartford Senators. The 17-year-old Lou is 0 for 3 as
Hartford loses to the Pittsfield Hillies, 2-1. He'll get his first hit -
a triple - in tomorrow's 5-3 win over the Waterbury Brasscos, and then play
just 10 more games.

Babe Ruth has a single, double and homer in a 9-8 loss to the Browns. This
is his 119th homer, tying Gavvy Cravath for the all-time record.

1922
In a 5-4 win over Detroit, Indians 1B Stuffy McInnis makes an error, his
first in 163 games.

1923
After pitching a CG win yesterday, Tiger P Herman Pillette relieves today
in the 8th against Cleveland with Detroit up, 7-5. Pillette allows both
inherited runners to score, but the Tigers tally a run in the bottom of
the 9th to give him his 2nd win in 2 days (as noted by Retrosheet).

1925
In a 12-7 win, White Sox player/manager Eddie Collins singles of Detroit's Rip
Collins for his 3,000th hit. The 38-year-old is the 6th player to reach 3,000.

1927
Paul Waner of Pittsburgh homers off Claude Willoughby of the Phils in an
11-1 rout at Forbes Field. Wright and Grantham also homer as Vic Aldridge
allows the visitors just one hit till the 9th inning. For Waner, his homer
is the start of a NL record 14 straight games in which he'll have at least
one long hit (12 doubles, 5 triples, 3 HR).

1929
HR-hitting 1B Joe "Unser Choe" Hauser is sold by the A's to Cleveland.

At Yankee Stadium, New York edges the White Sox, 1-0, in 1 hour 20 minutes. Ed
Wells allows 2 hits in beating Ted Lyons.

After losing 2 straight to the Phils, the Pirates wreak vengeance on the
visiting Quakers, beating them 14-2. The Phils pull off a triple play in
the 4th to keep the scoring down. Burleigh Grimes wins his 9th straight
with no defeats.

After 9 straight wins, Detroit's George Uhle loses, 3-2, to the A's in 13
innings. Foxx opens the 13th with a double, 2 intentional walks follow,
and an unintentional walk to Max Bishop ends it. Lefty Grove goes all the
way for the win.

1930
Grover Cleveland Alexander is released by the Phillies after posting a 0-3
record. He ends his career thinking he has the NL record for most wins at
373, one more than Christy Mathewson. In 1946, a win disallowed in 1902 is
restored to Mathewson's record, to leave the 2 pitchers at a tie.

1932
In Philadelphia, Lou Gehrig becomes the first player in the twentieth
century to blast four homeruns in one game, and barely misses hitting a
fifth. Gehrig's 5th inning homer - his 3rd of the game - comes off A's
starter George Earnshaw and follows a blast by Babe Ruth, his 15th. Lou's
last homer, in the 7th, is served up by Roy Mahaffey. Earl Combs adds another
for New York to help the Yanks set a total base record of 50. Jimmie Foxx
has a triple as he and Mickey Cochrane connect for the A's. Tony Lazzeri
blasts a grand slam to complete his natural cycle, with his four hits being
accomplished in sequential order; single, double, triple, homerun. The
Yankees hammer out a major league record with 50 total bases in a 20-13
slugfest with Philadelphia. And the teams set a still-standing record for
extra bases on long hits in a single game (41).

Citing poor health, John McGraw, who came to New York in 1902, resigns as
manager of the Giants and is replaced by Bill Terry, the team's star 1B.
During McGraw's tenure, the fiery manager won three World Series and
nine National League pennants, including a record four consecutive flags.
The headline announcement comes at the Polo Grounds, where the game with
the Phillies is rained out. McGraw was reportedly the highest paid manager
at $50,000 a year, the same as earned by Connie Mack, who owns about half
of the A's. Joe McCarthy of the Yankees now ranks 2nd at $40,000.

In an 11-inning defeat, 6-5, in Pittsburgh, two balls bounce by Chicago's
right fielder, Rogers Hornsby, for triples. The Cubs' player-manager, trying
the outfield for a week, will bench himself. Starter Steve Swetonic is the
winner when Tony Piet lines Jakey May's 1st pitch in the bottom of the 11th
to the flagpole in deep CF and jogs home with an inside-the-park homer.

1933
Against the Yankees in New York, the A's score 11 runs in the 3rd inning,
then watch New York score 10 in the 5th. Ben Chapman and Tony Lazzeri hit
homers in the inning, and Lazzeri, Jorgenson and Crosetti all have 2 hits
in the frame. Babe Ruth clouts his 10th of the year in the 8th. The A's
fail to score after the 3rd, as pitcher Jumbo Brown strikes out 12 A's in
6 1/3 innings of relief. The Yanks win 17-11. Not until the Red Sox in 1998
will another opponent tally eleven runs in an inning at Yankee Stadium.

Connie Mack suspends overweight P George Earnshaw and fines him $500 for
"failure to get into shape."

1934
The St. Louis Browns tie the AL record with 9 consecutive hits in the 6th
inning, all with 2 outs, to beat Cleveland, 12-8. The loss drops the Tribe
out of 1st place.

1935
The Indians break a 4-4 tie by scoring a record seven runs in the 14th
inning to beat the Browns, 11-4. The big blow is a grand slam by former
Brownie Bruce Campbell.

1937
Josh Gibson is credited with a drive that hits just 2 feet below the rim
of Yankee Stadium, about 580 feet from home plate. It is estimated by some
that the ball would have traveled nearly 700 feet.

1938
NL President Ford Frick orders the May 14th game at Sportsman's Park replayed,
upholding the Reds protest of the Cardinals' 7-6, 10-inning win. Dusty
Cooke's disputed triple is ruled a HR for the Reds OF. One umpire had
signaled Cooke's hit a HR, and Cooke slowed down, only to be tagged out.

Bill Lee of the Cubs blanks the Boston Bees, 4-0, for his 3rd straight
shutout, and Chicago moves to within 1 1/2 games of the Giants, who lose
their 4th straight to the Pirates. Lee will run his string to 32 scoreless
innings, and pitch 47 straight innings in which he allows one unearned run
and one extra base hit.

Washington's Rick and Wes Ferrell each double in runs as Wes beats the
White Sox, 5-1. Simmons adds a double and HR for the Nats.

1939
Joe Sprinz fractures his upper jaw in twelve places and has five teeth
knocked out attempting to catch a ball dropped 800 feet from a Goodyear
blimp. 'Mule', a catcher with the PCL's San Francisco Seals, had been
participating in Baseball Day at the Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure
Island in San Francisco Bay when the ball hit his upraised glove and was
driven into his face resulting in a two-month stay in the hospital.

1940
The Cubs get waivers from all 15 teams and send Dizzy Dean to Tulsa (Texas
League). Dean has submitted to a number of treatments, including teeth
extraction, but his arm has not responded, and the Cubs hope the Texas League
sun will help. He will pitch moderately well and is a great ticket seller.

Chicago loses to Brooklyn, 3-2, when Dolf Camilli homers off Claude Passeau.

1941
The Phils top the Cubs 7-0 on a one-hitter by P Tommy Hughes. Lou Novikoff's
single to lead off the 8th is the only hit.

Brooklyn tops the Cards 6-0 as Whitlow Wyatt tosses another shutout,
beating Mort Cooper. Reiser homers in the 1st, and Dolf Camilli adds another
roundtripper in the 4th.

1944
The Giants and Pirates are tied after 9 innings when an announcement comes
over the loud speaker that the invasion of Europe has begun. After cheering by
the 9,171 fans on hand, the players stood for a moment of silent prayer. It
turns out to be a false alarm, started when a young teletype operator
in the London office of AP was practicing on her machine and punched out
the message. The AP office in New York sent out the message nationwide,
then quickly sent a retraction. The genuine D-Day message will go out in
three days.

1945
The Browns' Tex Shirley pitches 13 scoreless innings against the A's,
but to no avail. The game ends 0-0.

1946
The A's release Bobo Newsom at his own request. He becomes a Senator for
the fourth time 2 days later.

The Reds sell Mike McCormick to the Braves.

The Red Sox sweep another doubleheader, this time beating the White Sox
6-1 and 5-2, behind Ferris and Dobson. The Sox will win 14 doubleheaders
this year, tying the mark of the 1943 Yankees and Indians, and the 1945
Senators. They won't lose any doubleheaders, splitting the other 13 this
year. In game 1 plus the 2nd game of the May 30 twinbill, Bobby Doerr sets
the AL record for chances handled in 2 consecutive games with 28.

1949
The Senators pound out 14 hits to beat Ned Garver and the Browns, 12-3. Paul
Calvert (6-3) is the complete game winner, but will lose his next 14 decisions
and the Senators will waive him to Detroit over the winter. The 14 straight
losses is the 4th worst ever in the AL, and will be matched by Howie Judson
this year.

1950
In direct challenge to a new league rule, the St. Louis Cardinals book a
Sunday night game with Brooklyn, the first in ML history.

The Braves' Sid Gordon slugs his 3rd grand slam of the season, plus a 2nd
HR, to account for 7 Braves runs in a 10-6 whipping of Pittsburgh. Gordon
now leads the NL in homers with 11. Westlake hits a pair of homers, and
Hank Schenz hits his 1st (and 2nd career) homer of the year. Johnny Sain
gives up a HR to Jethroe in winning his 8th, tops in the majors.

The Phils climb to a half game out of first place by beating the Cubs, 6-2,
behind Bubba Church's first ML win.

1951
With two outs in the second inning of an eventual 1-0 loss to the Giants,
Cardinals southpaw Max Lanier walks Monte Irvin, gives up a double down
the right field line to Willie Mays, and then intentionally walks Hank
Thompson to load the bases. The St. Louis lefty will get out of the early
jam by striking out opposing pitcher Dave Koslo, but the frame will mark
the first time in major league history a trio of black players occupy three
bases at the same time.

1952
After several games in right, Mantle returns to centerfield and celebrates
with four singles and scores two runs off Billy Pierce. The 4th place
Yankees beat the visiting Pale Hose, 4-3, in 13 innings

At Crosley Field, Frank Smith hurls 6 shutout innings of relief, allowing
one hit, as the Reds edge the Phils, 2-1.

In his 2nd straight game, ancient Satchel Paige pitches 5 2/3 innings
of scoreless ball against the Senators, goes 3 for 3 and drives in the
winning run in the top of 17th inning for his 5th victory. The Browns win,
3-2. Paige will finish the year with a .128 average. Browns starter Dave
Madison goes 4 1/3 innings and starts the trend by going 2 for 2 at the
plate ... he'll finish the year with a .105 average.

Y. Yamasaki of the Chunichi Dragons steals 6 bases in a single game for
a Japanese record. This ties the AL record of 6 set by Eddie Collins of
Philadelphia in 1912. It is one behind the NL record set by George Gore in
1881 and Billy Hamilton of Philadelphia in 1894.

1953
Congress cites the research of New York City librarian Robert Henderson
in proving that Alexander Cartwright "founded" baseball and not Abner
Doubleday. His 1947 book Bat, Ball and Bishop documents Cartwright's
contributions to the origins of the game of baseball.

1954
Henry Thompson of the Giants hits 3 HRs and knocks in 8 runs in a 13-8 win
against the Cardinals. Willie Mays collects the other 5 RBI on 2 HRs as
Alvin Dark scores 5 runs.

1955
Stan Musial hits the 300th HR of his career, a 5th-inning 3-run shot against
Brooklyn's Johnny Podres. The Cards use a NL-record 8 pitchers but still
lose 12-5.

The Cards trade veteran C Del Rice to the Braves for OF Pete Whisenant and
C Charlie White.

At Comiskey Park, Chicago's Jack Harshman gives up a solo homer to Mantle,
but gets the Yankee slugger to ground out in the 7th inning with the bases
loaded. Mantle's shot hits the left-centerfield facing of the 2nd deck. The
White Sox win 3-2.

1956
CF Richie Ashburn of the Phils goes 5 for 6 in the 2nd game of a doubleheader
against the Cards, a 9-3 win by former Red Bird Harvey Haddix. One run scores
on Red Schoendienst's 1st error of the year. Former Phil Murry Dickson wins
the opener, 2-1.

At Wrigley, Bonus Baby Sandy Koufax makes his first start of the season,
trimming the Cubs, 4-3, on 5 hits. Koufax K's 5.

At Baltimore, a pair of former Orioles take revenge on the O's as the White
Sox win, 12-0 and 9-2. Dick Donovan wins the lidlifter as ex-O Dave Philley
raps 4 hits. Erv Palica is the loser. Nellie Fox is hit by a pitch on the
seat of the pants by reliever Johnny Schmitz, but ump Hank Soar rules he
didn't try to get out of the way and calls a ball. Schmitz then hits him
again, and Fox gets 1B. In the nitecap, Jim Wilson hurls a 4-hitter to beat
his former teammates.

1957
In the 8th inning at Washington, Ted Williams wallops a 3-run homer off
starter Pedro Ramos to carry the Red Sox to a 5-3 win over the Senators. An
inning earlier, Jackie Jensen hit a solo homer. As researched by David
Vincent, Ramos will give up 17 homers this June, a ML record for homers
served up in one month.

1958
Led by Mantle's 3-run homer in the first, the Yanks jump on Dick Donovan,
who does not retire a batter. New York rolls to an easy 13-0 win over the
White Sox.

The Dodger referendum passes by a slim margin. The proposition allows the
city to sell 300 acres of Chavez Ravine to the Dodgers for their stadium. The
NL president had stated that the Dodgers should vacate Los Angeles if the
bill failed.

1959
At Detroit, Mickey Mantle homers off Ray Narleski in the 9th to give the
Yankees a 6-5 win. New York chases nemesis Frank Lary with 5 runs in the 3rd.

1962
The Senators trade outfielder Willie Tasby to the Indians for pitchers
Steve Hamilton and Don Rudolph.

1963
Chicago White Sox 1B Joe Cunningham is sidelined until Labor Day after
fracturing his right collarbone in a collision with Angels 1B Charlie
Dees. The Sox are 1/2 game ahead of New York. Cunningham, who hit .295 last
year with 101 walks, will never be the same player after the injury.

The Braves make their first appearance in Boston since moving in 1953,
losing a 5-3 exhibition game to the Red Sox. The game is for the benefit
of the Jimmy Fund.

1966
White Sox SS Ron Hansen undergoes surgery for a ruptured spinal disk. He
is disabled the rest of the season.

1967
Harmon Killebrew launches the longest homerun ever hit in Metropolitan
Stadium, a 503-foot shot which travels deep in the second deck of the
left-center field bleachers, off Lew Burdette, with two on, as the Twins down
the Angels, 8-6. The stadium chair the ball hit by the Twins' outfielder is
mounted high on a wall overlooking the flume ride at Nickelodeon Universe
in the Mall of America, the former site of the Met, in the precise spot
the ball landed in the upper deck in deep left-center field.

At Candlestick Park, the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants split a
pair. The Giants take the opener, 11-2, behind Juan Marichal, who gives up
13 hits and one earned run. The Giants also make 13 hits, including HRs by
Ollie Brown and Willie Mays, as the Mets' Jack Fisher pitches 4 2/3 innings
and allows 11 runs (9 earned); not till 2006 will any Mets pitcher allow
as many runs. The Mets win game 2 in 11 innings, 2-1, as Bob Shaw allows
4 hits and goes the distance. Tom Haller's HR is the Giants only score.

Boston P Dennis Bennett wins 6-2, beating Cleveland's Gary Bell.

1969
Behind the slugging of McCovey and Mays, the Giants beat the Expos, 9-3,
handing Montreal its 17th straight loss, tying the ML mark for expansion

Mays homer in the 4th with one of his own.

1971
At Cincinnati, Cub southpaw Ken Holtzman tosses the 2nd no-hitter of his
career, victimizing the Reds 1-0. Holtzman scores the only run, unearned,
in the 3rd inning to beat Gary Nolan.

1972
The Reds spot the host Phils a 5-0 lead, then score 3 runs in the 7th,
and one each in the 8th, 9th and 10th to win, 6-5. Julian Javier starts
the Reds scoring with a 2-run homer and ends it with a RBI single. Johnny
Bench also homers, his 7th in the last 5 games to tie a NL record.

Rusty Staub of the Mets is struck in the right hand by a George Stone pitch
during a game with the Braves. Staub, who missed 7 games in the past 4
seasons, will miss 90 games this year.

Bobby Murcer and Thurman Munson crack 3-run HRs in the Yankees' 8-run 13th
inning to beat the White Sox 18-10. Murcer scores 5 runs on 4 hits.

to a 5-1 win over the Pirates.

1976
The Red Sox send Bernie Carbo to Milwaukee in exchange for P Tom Murphy

walks 8 and uses 153 pitches in the win.

1978
The Braves and the Cubs tie a major league record using 14 hurlers in a
single game. Each team uses seven pitchers when Chicago beats Atlanta at
Wrigley Field, 8-6.

The Phils' Davey Johnson breaks up a 1-1 9th-inning tie with Los Angeles by
hitting his 2nd pinch grand slam of the year. His first came on April 30th
when he broke up a 5th-inning tie in San Diego. Johnson is the first ML player
to accomplish this feat, but Mike Ivie will duplicate it later this month.

1979
The Phils tops the Reds, 6-4, then lose 12-2 in the nitecap. George Foster
has 3 homers for the Reds.

1980
Oakland makes it close when Dave Revering, Mitchell Page and Tony Armas
all homer in the 9th inning against Cleveland, but the Indians hold on for
a 6-4 win.

The New York Mets select 18-year-old Darryl Strawberry from Los Angeles'
Crenshaw High School with the first pick in the annual June free-agent
draft. During Strawberry's stormy eight-year tenure with the team, the 6'
6" outfielder will establish franchise records with 252 homers and 733
RBIs. With the second pick the Blue Jays select SS Garry Harris. Lefty Ken
Dayley (Braves) is the 3rd pick, pitcher Mike King (A's) 4th, Jeff Pyburn
(Padres) 5th, and Darnell Coles (M's) 6th. The Reds pick Danny Tartabull
in the 3rd round and Eric Davis in the 8th. In the 16th round, the Twins
take Jim Eisenreich while the Red Sox pick Oil Can Boyd. In the 4th round
of the secondary phase draft on June 5, the Rangers find gold with Tom Henke.

1981
Royals C Jerry Grote hits a grand slam (his first homerun since 1976) and
goes 3 for 4 with a club-record 7 RBI to lead Kansas City to a 12-9 win

with the Royals as a free agent during spring training.

1982
A minor-league attendance mark of 65,666 is set at Denver's Mile High
Stadium as the Omaha Royals top the Bears 7-4.

1983
George Bamberger resigns as manager of the New York Mets, whose 16-30
record is the big-leagues' worst. He will be replaced by Frank Howard,
who managed the Padres in 1981.

1985
The Brewers select University of North Carolina catcher B. J. Surhoff with
the first pick in what will prove to be an extremely fruitful free-agent
draft. Surhoff was the catcher for the U.S. Olympic Team last summer, and
fellow Olympians Will Clark (Mississippi State), Bobby Witt (University
of Oklahoma) and Barry Larkin (University of Michigan) are drafted 2nd,
3rd and 4th by the Giants, Rangers and Reds, respectively. The Cubs get
a good one in the 24th round, Mark Grace, while the White Sox take Randy
Velarde in the 18th round. The Brewers take Phil Clark with the 18th pick
of the first round, following his brother Isaiah who was a 1st round pick
last year. Neither will play in the ML, but brother Jerald, who goes to the
Padres in the 12th round today, will make it. The Tigers pick a winner in
the 22nd round with John Smoltz, then trade him in 1987.

1987
The Chicago Cubs rout the Houston Astros, 22-7, at Wrigley Field in a game
that features a ML-record-tying 3 grand slams. Keith Moreland and Brian
Dayett hit grand slams for Chicago, and Billy Hatcher connects for the
Astros to equal the record set by the Orioles and the Rangers last August
6th. Jody Davis scores 5 runs for Chicago.

1988
The Royals trade P Bud Black to Cleveland for versatile Pat Tabler.

1989
Nolan Ryan pitches his 2nd one-hitter this season and 11th overall,
allowing only a first-inning lead-off single to Harold Reynolds, in a 6-1
win over Seattle. Ryan also strikes out 11 to tie Don Sutton's ML record
of 21 seasons with at least 100 strikeouts. The Alvin, Texas native breaks
Bob Feller's record of 15 low-hit games having now pitched a combination
of 16 no-hit and one-hit games.

Houston beats Los Angeles, 5-4 in 22 innings, in a game that takes
7 hours 14 minutes to complete, making it the longest game in National
League history. Rafael Ramirez' 2nd RBI of the game finally ends it at
2:50 A.M. on the 4th. When the Dodgers use up all 24 players, (except for
tomorrow's starter Tim Belcher), 3B Jeff Hamilton becomes the final and
losing pitcher and P Fernando Valenzuela finishes the game at 1B. John

and walks none in 8 1/3, while Green strikes out 14 in 9 innings. Shockers CF

putting Wichita up, 3-2. Audley then throws out a runner at home to end
the game.

third in the National League East. Tom Runnels replaces Rodgers as the new
Montreal Expos manager.

Seattle selects SS Alex Rodriguez of Westminster Christian HS in Miami with
the 1st pick in the amateur draft. Rodriguez hit .417 with 17 homers and
90 stolen bases. The Tigers, picking 9th, take speedster Matt Brunson, who
will steal 106 bases in 329 A-level minor league games which is impressive,
considering he will hit just .200. The Brewers get pitchers Jeff D'Amico
and Kelly Wunsch with two 1st round picks. Both will prove injury prone,
but they do take SS Mark Loretta on the 7th round. The Phils take Scott
Rolen in the 2nd round; the Braves select Kevin Millwood (11th) and John
Rocker (18th), while the Indians take Richie Sexson (24th). The Dodgers pick

1995
Pitching against the Padres, Expos P Pedro Martinez (4-1) retires the first
27 batters, only to see the Pods Bip Roberts lead off the 10th inning with
a double. Reliever Mel Rojas then retires the next three batters. San Diego
starter Joey Hamilton is almost as good, giving up just 3 hits and no runs
through 9 innings. Reliever Brian Williams yields Jeff Treadway's RBI single
in the top of the 10th. With the rules regarding no-hitters revised in 1991,
Martinez receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter. The
win moves the Expos to within 3 games of the NL East-leading Phillies.

Rangers 3B Dean Palmer, hitting .333 with 9 HRs and 24 RBIs in his first
114 at-bat, ruptures the biceps tendon in his left arm while swinging at,
and missing, a pitch from Minnesota's Kevin Tapani. Palmer will be sidelined

the Cardinals to a 15-4 win over the Colorado Rockies. SS Royce Clayton
is 5 for 6 as St. Louis collects 21 hits. The Cardinals hit 3 homers in a
7-run 5th off Jerry Dipoto.

In Atlanta, the Padres get a little help from the umps to top the Braves,
5-2. After viewing television tapes, the umps reverse a call and take
away Keith Lockhart's two-run homer in the 8th after Lockhart circles the
bases. Lockhart then grounds out to end the inning. The Padres score 3 in
the ninth against Mark Wohlers to win.

Greeting a raucous bell-ringing crowd in his return to Jacobs Field, Albert
Belle clouts a 3-run homer and two doubles to lead the White Sox to a 9-5
win over the Tribe. Belle finishes the game with an obscene gesture to the
crowd. The gesture will cost him a $5,000 fine from the league, payable in
tickets to underprivileged kids.

In Oakland, Mark McGwire hits his 22nd homer as Oakland rallies for five
runs in the seventh inning to beat Detroit, 9-8. It is McGwire's 10th homer
in 19 games.

The annual June amateur draft features two brothers being drafted in the
first round. Ignoring J.D. Drew's warnings about not drafting him unless
they're ready to pay out, the Phils take the FSU junior with the 2nd pick,
while the Indians take his brother Tim, a high school senior, with the
28th pick. It's the first time brothers have been picked in the same
first round. In another first, Great Bridge High School in Chesapeake,
VA, has two players picked on the first round: Michael Cuddyer, a SS, by
the Twins with the 9th pick, and pitcher John Curtice, by the Red Sox with
the 17th pick. The number one pick overall is Rice University pitcher Matt
Anderson by the Tigers, who skip over J.D. Drew because of the anticipated
cost. Anderson was the WAC Tournament MVP and the top pitching prospect in
the Cape Cod League last summer. Drew, The Sporting News College Player of
the Year, is the first Division I player in history to hit 30 homers and
steal 30 bases in one season. The Anaheim Angels take Troy Glaus, UCLA 3B,
with the 3rd pick. The Giants, use 4th to take Seton Hall pitcher Jason
Grilli, son of former ML pitcher, Steve Grilli. Toronto uses #5 on Texas
high schooler Vernon Wells. The Mets have the 6th pick and pick Tampa high
schooler Geoff Goetz, nixing another Florida pitcher Rick Ankiel because he
is being advised by agent Scott Boras. Ankiel goes to the Cards at #72 (2nd
round). Number 7 is the Royals and they take U of the Pacific fireballer
Dan Reichert. Number 10 Jon Garland, considered possibly the best high
school pitching prospect in the draft, goes to the Cubs, who will swap
him to the White Sox next July. The Reds take Scott Williamson in the 9th
round. The Mariners, picking 19th, take Ryan Anderson, nicknamed "Big Unit
II," dashing the Tigers hopes of taking the 6' 10" high school pitcher from
Westland, MI. With the next pick, the Cardinals take Adam Kennedy, from Cal
State Northridge. Kennedy led the nation in hits for the second consecutive
season, the first time an NCAA player to do so. The Yankees gamble at #24,
picking high school star Tyrell Godwin, of Elizabethtown, NC. A two-sport
athlete, Godwin is committed to North Carolina to play football. The Padres
(#27) pick Stetson SS Kevin Nicholson, the MVP of the Cape Cod League
last summer. He is the first Canadian ever drafted in the first round. The
Athletics appear to have the best draft with Tim Hudson (6th round), Eric
DuBose (1st), Chad Harville (2nd) and Robert Vaz (7th). Nathan Haynes is
selected in round 1 but will be traded to the Angels for Randy Velarde.

The Brewers lose their one slugger when John Jaha goes under the knife to

(5 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 4 ER, 4 BB, 7 SO) is equally ineffective and neither get
a decision. Derek Jeter has 4 hits and 2 walks, just the 6th player to get
4 hits in a game off Maddux.
