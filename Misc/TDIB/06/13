1903
At League Park, Joe Kelley's first-inning triple is the lone hit off
Mathewson, who whitewashes the Reds, 4-0. Noodles Hahn takes the loss. It
is the 3rd shutout in a row for the Giants' staff.

1904
At the Polo Grounds, Chicago tops the Giants, 3-2, as Three Finger Brown
outduels Christy Mathewson for the win. Frank Chance leads the Chicago
offense by hitting for the cycle. The loss drops New York back into 2nd
place, one-half game behind Chicago.

1905
At the West Side Grounds, Christy Mathewson and the Zephyrs' (Cubs) Mordecai
"Three Finger" Brown duel. Brown almost matched Matty for 8 innings, allowing
just 2 hits, but 4 straight hits in the 9th score the winning run for the
Giants, 1-0. Matty tosses his 2nd no-hitter and his 31-8 record and 1.27
ERA, with 9 shutouts, will mark his 3rd straight 30-win season. In 1901,
20-year-old 'Matty' became the first rookie in the modern era to throw a
no-no, holding the Cardinals hitless in the Giants' 5-0 victory at Robison
Field.

During a 7-0 White Sox win over host Washington, Frank Owen of the Sox,
steals home in the 8th inning. It is the second double steal of the game
for the Sox against the Stahlwarts, and it is Owen's 2nd steal of home,
both against the Nats.

1907
The Boston Red Sox play an exhibition game at Providence, raising $3,140.50
for Chick Stahl's widow. The clubs and players also contribute.

1908
Chicago's Three Finger Brown pitches a 2-hit victory over the Phillies,
with both hits coming off the bat of Sherry Magee.

In Chicago's 5-1 10-inning win over the Yankees, Sox pitcher Ed Walsh swipes
home in the 7th.

The St. Louis Browns purchase land adjacent to Sportsman's Park to build
additional stands.

1910
The White Sox finally score against the Nationals and beat them, 2-1,
in 13 innings. Chick Gandhil's RBI double drives home the winner.

1911
Christy Mathewson (11-2) gives up 11 hits but still beats the Reds, 5-2. Art
Fromme loses as Matty wins for the 19th straight time against Cincy.

1912
New York's Christy Mathewson wins, 3-2 over the Cubs for his 300th career
victory. The Cubs threaten in the 9th when Tommy Leach leads off with a fly
ball that Beals Becker loses in the sun for a triple, but Matty retires the
next 3 batters for the win. The Giants take three of four from Chicago and
have now won a ML record 14 straight series (one series was just one game).

1913
In the top of the ninth inning with no outs at New York's Polo Grounds,
Christy Mathewson strands a runner on third base to record his 300th victory
when the Giants edge the Cubs, 3-2. During his 17-year major league career,
'Big Six' will compile a 373-188 record.

The White Sox win, 5-1, behind the hitting and pitching of Jim Scott. Scott
clubs a 2-run homer, his only major league roundtripper, off the Yankees'
George McConnell.

1915
Whoops. Connie Mack waives Herb Pennock, his Opening Day pitcher, to the
Red Sox for $1,500. Mack states that Pennock will probably become a good
pitcher, but that the A's have several pitchers joining the team who will
help immediately. It's doubtful, since the A's will set the ML mark for
most walks in a season (827). They will finish last this year and the next
7 years as well.

1916
Babe Ruth goes 5 1/3 innings and, with relief help from Ernie Shore,
beats the Browns, 5-3. Ruth allows one run and is 2 for 2 at the plate,
including his 3rd homer in 3 games.

1918
The Phils and Cardinals go 19 innings ending in an 8-8 tie. The Phils blow
a 6-run lead with St. Louis tying at 8-8 in the 7th. Hornsby has 4 errors
in 21 chances, while Cliff Heathcote hits for the cycle, though it takes
him 9 at-bats.

A day after his Browns blow a 4-0 lead in the 9th and lose to the Senators,
6-4, manager Fielder Jones abruptly leaves the team. Shortstop Jimmy Austin
will skipper the team for 16 games before Jimmy Burke is brought aboard.

1920
The Yankees rout the Indians, 14-0, as Ruth hits his 17th HR of the year,
off Myers. New York scores 6 in the first inning.

1921
At the Polo Grounds, Ruth hits two homers and pitches the first five innings
for New York, and the Yanks hang on for a 13-8 victory over Detroit. The
Babe gives up 4 runs but strikes out Ty Cobb and is credited with the
victory. Ruth's 2nd homer goes 460 feet into the right CF bleachers at
the Polo Grounds, the first HR ever hit to that spot. The Bambino retires
The Peach twice today, and Cobb's bottom-line batting average versus Ruth
finishes at .354 (23 for 65). The 'Bambino' will break his own major league
record this year going deep 59 times, but this is the only time this season
he will be the starting pitcher for the Bronx Bombers.

In Cleveland, 6 Indian batters reach first, 5 on hits, against reliever
Walter Johnson, and roll to a 10-6 win over Washington.

Umpires in both leagues begin the practice of rubbing dirt into the balls
before each game, using a special clay supplied by A's coach Lena Blackburne
from his New Jersey farm.

1922
In the final game of the 4-game series in St. Louis, the Browns earn a
split by pasting the Yankees, 13-4, behind Dave Danforth. George Sisler's
base-loaded triple in the 5-run 6th is the big blow.

1924
In the last of a three-game series, the first-place Yankees take a 10-6 lead
in the top of the 9th. With one out Babe Ruth takes a pitch in close before
fouling out, then Bob Meusel is hit in the back with a pitch by reliever
Bert Cole, and charges the mound. Players from both teams start swinging,
with Ruth and Cobb pushing each other. Fans rush out of the stands, eager
to mix it up with players, police and each other. The fight goes on for
nearly 30 minutes before umpire Billy Evans, unable to clear the field,
finally forfeits the game to New York. Cole and Meusel are suspended for
10 days; Meusel is fined $100, and Cole and Ruth $50 each.

The Cardinals send washed up Bill Doak to Brooklyn for P Leo Dickerman. Doak
holds the franchise record for most shutouts with 32, a record that will
only be topped by Bob Gibson's 56. "Spittin' Bill" will win 11 games for
the Robins this season and then voluntarily retire before returning in
1927. The visiting Cards whip Brooklyn today, 8-3, behind Al Sothoron.

1925
At Chicago, the Cubs beat the Braves, 2-0, with Charlie Grimm's two homers
providing all the scoring. Elmer Jacobs applies the calcimine.

1926
Jack Fournier hits 3 homers and Brooklyn needs them all to beat the Cubs,
6-5. Burleigh Grimes is the winner at home.

1927
New York defeats the Indians, 14-6, at New York. Ben Paschal belts 2 homers,
a triple and a double, and scores 5 runs to lead NY. Lazzeri, Collins and
Dugan also homer with Collins a grand slam. Herb Pennock is the winner.

At Boston, the Browns' Elam Vangilder shuts out the Bosox to win, 2-0. He
also has two singles and a homer over the clock in left center. Ted Wingfield
pitches 8 innings in losing.

1928
Behind Dazzy Vance's 10 strikeouts, the Robins beat the Cubs, 7-2. Kiki
Cuyler's solo homer in the 1st inning put the Cubs in the lead, but Babe
Herman tops that with two homers, one inside and one outside the park. Pat
Malone takes the loss.

1930
For the first time in baseball history, former batting champions are
exchanged for one another when the Senators trade Goose Goslin to the Browns
for Heinie Manush (and Al "General" Crowder). Both Hall of Fame outfielders
won their titles in the American League with Manush hitting .387 playing for
the Tigers in 1926, and Goslin leading the circuit two years later with a
.378 batting average for Washington. It's probably Washington's best trade
ever. Crowder was the top pitcher in the AL in 1928, while Manush hit .355
in 1929. The Senators will regain the popular Goslin in 1932, and with
Manush and Crowder, he will help them win a pennant the following year.

Cleveland again beats Philadelphia, 15-2, and takes over first place. Wes
Ferrell wins easily as Cleveland clubs southpaw nemesis Rube Walberg.

Rip Collins goes all the way to give the Browns a 1-0 win over the Red Sox
in 11 innings.

1931
Adam Comorosky, the Pittsburgh LF who made an unassisted DP on May 31,
makes another as the Giants win 6-4. With the Giants leading 1-0 in the 5th,
Comorosky snags a Freddy Leach line drive and doubles up Clarence Mitchell,
the runner at 2B.

The Cubs and Pirates swap catchers, Earl Grace going to Pittsburgh and
Rollie Hemsley to Chicago.

1932
Outfielders Dale Alexander and Roy Johnson are traded by Detroit to Boston
for doubles champ Earl Webb. Alexander, batting only .250, will hit .372 with
Boston and will edge out Jimmie Foxx for the batting title by 3 points. Roy
Johnson, who set a ML record in 1929 by making 31 outfield errors, will
hit over .300 and average in double figures for errors with the Bosox.

1933
White Sox P Whit Wyatt has his no hitter spoiled when, with 2 outs in the
9th, Brownie Ted Gullic gets a hit. Wyatt wins, 6-1. The Sox acquired Wyatt
just 11 days ago from the Tigers for Vic Frasier.

1934
At St. Louis, Billy Urbanski, Braves SS, has 4 walks and 2 sacrifices for no
at-bats in 6 plate appearances against the Cardinals. He scores once. Rival
SS, slick-fielding Leo Durocher, makes 4 errors in the 9-0 Boston rout.

1935
Cleveland's Oral Hildebrand tops the A's, 4-3, as Earl Averill is 3 for 5
with a stolen base. Cleveland is in 4th place, with New York leading the
AL by 2 1/2 games over Chicago.

1936
After a 2-day absence, Van Mungo rejoins the Dodgers in Cincinnati and
pitches the final 3 innings of the 2nd game of a doubleheader, preserving
a 2-1 win for Fred Frankhouse. The Reds win the 13-inning opener, 6-5.

1937
In an afternoon doubleheader at St. Louis, the Yanks and Browns slug it out,
with New York winning the opener, 16-9, by scoring 14 runs in the last 4
innings. The Yanks score 7 runs in the 9th inning off Jim Walkup and Lou
Koupal to put it away. The hitting continues in the nitecap, with DiMaggio
connecting for 3 straight homers, the 3rd off starter Julio Bonetti tying
the score with two out in the 9th. The game is called after 11 innings with
the score at 8-8. On the afternoon, there are 9 homeruns ... three each by
DiMag and Harlond Clift, and Tony Lazzeri, Bill Dickey and Joe Vosmik each
clouting one.

1938
In a stellar move for Cincinnati, Philadelphia's Bucky Walters is sold to
the Reds for $55,000 plus players Virgil Davis and Al Hollingsworth.

1940
At Cooperstown, Ted Williams hits 2 homers against the Cubs, but Chicago
counters with 4 round trippers to win the 7-inning rain-shortened exhibition
game, 10-9.

The Cleveland players petition owner Alva Bradley to remove Oscar Vitt as
manager. "Sometimes it seems he'll drive us all nuts," says Bob Feller. "Maybe
it's just his nervousness." Bradley declines, stating that the club is just
2 games behind Boston. The Indians tip the Tigers, 3-2, in 11 innings,
winning on Charlie Gehringer's throwing error. Cleveland has their best
month of the year, settling into first place, which they will hold until
the final 2 weeks of the season.

1941
Dodger ace Whitlow Wyatt continues his mastery of the Cards, winning 1-0
in the series opener.

Dutch Leonard's pitching.

The Browns stay 1 1/2 games in front of Boston by scoring 3 runs in the
9th to beat the host White Sox, 5-3. Jack Kramer is the winner over Eddie
Lopat. Playing in his final game, veteran outfielder Frank Demaree is 0 for
3 to drop his 12-year career average from .29954 to .29947, preventing him
from finishing with a .300 average.

1945
In Boston, the Phils lose the 1st game, 8-3, for their club-record 16th
loss in a row. In game 2, the Braves contribute 8 errors to help the Phils
win 5-4, but it takes them 15 innings to do it.

1947
The Boston Red Sox beat the Chicago White Sox, 5-3, before 34,510 "first
nighters" in the first night game at Fenway Park. After the game, the
White Sox trade 1B Jake Jones to the Red Sox for Rudy York. Jones was a
WW2 flying ace (he shot down 7 confirmed Japanese zeroes, according to TSN,
April 12, 1945).

Mort Cooper joins his brother on the Giants as the Braves trade the veteran
pitcher to New York for former 20-game winner Bill Voiselle. The Braves
will give Voiselle uniform #96 since the pitcher is from Ninety Six, NC.

1948
With the crowd of 49,641 singing 'Auld Lang Syne' to the Babe in his final
appearance at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees celebrate the silver anniversary
of Yankee Stadium by holding 'Babe Ruth Day'. Mel Allen introduces the
Babe. With members of the 1923 team (the first team to play in the stadium)
looking on, the dying superstar's uniform number 3 is retired and sent to
Cooperstown. After the ceremonies and a two inning game between Old-timers
in which the team of 1923 defeats a team of all-stars from later years,
2-0, the Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians 5-3. Joe DiMaggio belts two
triples and Rizzuto and Berra add homers to back Lopat's pitching. Lopat

putting every Sox regular over .300.

1951
Oklahoma wins the College WS in Omaha, defeating Tennessee in the final
game, 3-2.

1953
The Yankees overwhelm the Indians, 9-4, for their 16th straight win. The
Tribe now trails by 8 1/2 lengths. Eddie Lopat is on his way to his 7th
straight win when the Yankees rout Bob Feller in the 4th inning, running
the ace's record to 29-37 versus New York, the only team against whom he
has a losing record.

The Braves score a run in the 9th to trip the Pirates, 5-4, and tie for
the lead with the idle Dodgers. Lew Burdette, in relief of Warren Spahn
wins his 5th game, defeating Paul LaPalme.

1954
Cardinals LF Rip Repulski has 2 hits in each game of a doubleheader sweep
against Pittsburgh, to start a string of 10 straight games in which he

after getting drilled in the ribs by the Dodger right-hander resulting in
banishment for both players.

At Comiskey Park, an ugly brawl, precipitated by an Art Ditmar pitch behind
Larry Doby's head, breaks out when the White Sox infielder takes exception
to being the target of the bean ball and punches the Yankee hurler. Billy
Martin, Walt Dropo, Bill Skowron and Enos Slaughter all actively participate
in the melee.

The Indians, in an effort to get more power from their outfield, send Jim
Busby to the Orioles in exchange for 28-year-old Dick Williams, who will
play only 67 games with the Tribe before being dealt back to Baltimore. As
a result of the trade, Roger Maris will move from left to become Cleveland's
full-time center fielder.

For the 2nd time this year, Ted Williams hits 3 HRs - off Early Wynn and Jim
Lemon - and drives in 5 runs in a 9-2 Boston win over the Indians. Williams
is the first to have two three-homer games in one season in the AL. Ted was so
disgusted with his pregame hitting that he tossed his bat 50 feet in the air.

The Tigers send 1B Earl Torgeson to the White Sox in exchange for OF Dave
Philley and cash.

innings to lead a 22-3 romp. He finishes with 5 hits.

1960
The Indians trade C Russ Nixon and OF Carroll Hardy to the Red Sox for Marty
Keough and P Ted Bowsfield. Nixon had been traded in March to the Red Sox for

once pinch hit for Maris in Cleveland, and will do the same for Ted Williams
this year, the only time Williams will ever have a pinch hitter.

1962
Sandy Koufax smacks his first ML homerun, and it comes off another future
Hall of Famer, Warren Spahn. It is the winning blow in the 2-1 win at
Milwaukee. Sandy will hit one more career round tripper.

1963
At Candlestick, Willie Mays breaks up a pitching duel between Dick Ellsworth
and Bill O'Dell by belting a one-out 10th-inning HR to give San Francisco

successfully pulls the hidden ball trick on the Royals' Joe Keough in the
6th after Joe singles in the tying run. Michael will pull it again next month.

1971
Chico Ruiz allegedly pulls a gun on Angels teammate Alex Johnson in
a clubhouse incident. There are no witnesses to the episode, which Ruiz
denies, and it is one of a series of problems involving Johnson in 1971. Both
players are hitless pinch hitters in the 5-2 loss to Washington.

1973
The Dodgers infield, which will be together eight and a half years setting
a major league record for longevity, play together for the first time. First
baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, third baseman Ron Cey and
shortstop Bill Russell are in the line up in the 16-3 defeat to the Phillies.

Dock Eliis walks a batter without ever throwing a pitch to him. After going
2-0 on the Atlanta left fielder Sonny Jackson, the Pirates right-hander

pinch-hitter for Jackson, to complete the base-on-balls which is attributed
to the Bucs' starting pitcher.

At Riverfront Stadium, Cards pitcher Rick Wise loses a no hitter when the
Reds' Joe Morgan singles with one out in the 9th. Wise finishes with a
one-hit 8-0 win. Wise pitched a no-hitter over the Reds in 1971.

At Montreal, Expos Mike Marshall relieves in the 7th with the bases loaded
and no outs. Marshall's 1st pitch to Jerry Morales is hit to 2B Ron Hunt,
who tosses to Tim Foli to Mike Jorgensen at 1st, to John Boccabella behind
the plate for a triple play on one pitch. The Expos win, 3-2.

1974
Henry Aaron addresses the House of Representatives in a special Flag Day

pitchers and cash.

1984
In a deal that will pay off in the short run with a NL East Championship,
the Cubs trade outfielders Mel Hall and Joe Carter and minor leaguer
Darryl Banks to the Indians for P George Frazier, C Ron Hassey and P Rick
Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe will go 16-1 for the Cubs the rest of the season and
win the NL Cy Young Award. Because Cubs GM Dallas Green neglected to renew
waivers on Hall and Carter, the status of the trade is in doubt for a while,
and the two will not play for a week.

Yankees reliever John Wetteland is quoted as saying he'll leave the Yankees
at the end of the season. He later denies the comments but does leave after
the season.

1997
Randy Johnson proves he can bring it in either league as the Big Unit strikes
out 12 Rockies in 8 innings to give the Mariners a 6-1 win. Johnson (10-1)
holds baseball's highest-scoring team to just two hits and the Mariners
sweep the two-game interleague series.

Baseball's two best teams deal their aces and once again Jimmy Key bests

doesn't remember anything after the second inning.

becomes the first pitcher in the 129-year history of the franchise and the
22nd in major league history to accomplish the feat. Ted Barrett becomes
the first major league ump to be behind the plate for two perfect games. In

Matt Cain, the 18-year veteran arbitrator was also the home-plate umpire when
David Cone threw his perfecto against the Expos at Yankee Stadium in 1999.

R.A. Dickey, who gives up only a first inning infield single for his second
