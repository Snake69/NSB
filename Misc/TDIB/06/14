1905
The White Stockings keep stealing in Washington, as veteran George Davis
swipes 4 bases in a 5-3 win. Ed Walsh is the victor. The 4 bases is a club
record that will be tied but not topped this century.

1906
The Brooklyn Superbas record 27 putouts and 27 assists in beating the Pirates,
6-1. This will stand as the record until Pittsburgh totals 28 on June 7, 1911.

The White Sox win their 3rd straight from Washington, 2-0, as Ed Walsh,
pitching on 2 days rest, allows 5 hits. The Sox will lose to the Senators,
tomorrow, ending their 7-game win streak. Sox prexy Comiskey hires
H.B. Conibear, the trainer for the University of Chicago teams, to help
with the Sox players.

1907
At Boston, the Browns knock Cy Young for 3 runs in the first and George
Winter comes in for the last 8 innings. The Sox rally for 4 runs to win 4-3.

At Pittsburgh, Mathewson is hit in the stomach by a Lefty Leifield pitch
in the 9th, but the two battle until the 12th when the Pirates push over
the winning run. Pittsburgh wins, 2-1.

1908
Chicago beats the Yankees, 5-4, with a late rally that puts Moxie Manual
in the record books. Moxie, pitching in relief, is lifted in the 8th inning
and his Sox score to go ahead. Commissioner Ban John will rule that Moxie is
the winner, not the pitcher who succeeds him, this establishing a precedent
about awarding victories.

1912
"Deerfoot" Clyde Milan steals 5 bases, including home, in 3 innings as the
Senators beat Cleveland, 13-8, for their 14th straight win, all on the road.

1913
At Forbes Field, Christy Mathewson allows 7 hits, including a homer by
Owen Wilson, but holds on to beat the Bucs, 6-5. Hank Robinson takes the
loss. The Giants sweep the 3-game series.

At Chicago, Walter Johnson stops the White Sox, 8-3. Sox C Ray Schalk hits
his first ML homer off Johnson and it will be his only roundtripper this year.

1916
Cubs spitballer Jimmy Lavender has his moist one working against the
Giants, beating New York, 4-0. The only hit is an infield single by Benny
Kauff. Mathewson takes the loss, though all four runs are unearned.

1917
At St. Louis, the Cardinals pull off a triple steal in the 5th inning to help
beat the Brooklyn Dodgers, 5-4. Dots Miller is on the front end with Walton
Cruise and Tom Long following. Rogers Hornsby hits a home run in the 7th.

1919
Batting only .198 in 25 games since being acquired last month from the
Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, Joe Wilhoit scratches out a
first-inning single to begin the longest consecutive game hitting streak
in the history of professional baseball. The Wichita Jobbers' outfielder
will hit safely in 69 Western League contests, collecting 153 hits in 297
at-bats for an astounding .515 batting average.

White Sox ace Eddie Cicotte beats the A's for the 12th straight time enroute
to 29 wins versus 7 losses and a 1.82 ERA. He also registers his 12th win
of the year, 6-3, in 14 innings, going all the way. The starter, Tom Rogers,
purchased from the Browns in April, is the loser for the A's.

On the front end of a 3rd-inning double steal, Giants outfielder George
Burns swipes home against the Cubs for the game's only run. Burns also
collects two doubles in the game, won by Fred Toney over Hippo Vaughn,
1-0. In a game last June, Burns hit a solo homer for the only score.

1921
NL P Ray Fisher is placed permanently on the ineligible list by Commissioner
Landis for alleged contract jumping. Thinking he was being placed on the
voluntary retired list by Reds owner Garry Hermann, Fisher had left the
Reds in order to become a baseball coach at the University of Michigan. He
will serve in Ann Arbor for 38 years, not returning to coach in the majors
until the early 1960s, with the Braves and Tigers.

Ruth hits 2 more HRs, his 6th and 7th in 5 games, including his 2nd in
2 days into the CF bleachers at the Polo Grounds, in a 9-6 win over the
Tigers. Hooks Dauss does the teeing up today.

1922
At St. Louis, the Browns spot the Senators' Walter Johnson a 5-0 lead,
then come back on Sisler's grand slam to win, 7-6. Bill Bayne takes the
loss while Rasty Wright is the winner.

Despite 3 errors by SS Harvey McClellan in the 8th inning, the White Sox
edge the A's, 6-5. Red Faber beats Fred Heimach. McCellan fumbles one ball,
makes a wild throw and fails to cover 2B on a throw for his three errors.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants demolish the Pirates, 13-0, behind the
pitching of Phil Douglas, and now lead the NL by 5 games. For the Buccaneers,
it is their first shutout of the year. They'll suffer only one more whitewash
to lead the NL, after being shutout the most (14) last season.

1923
Rogers Hornsby returns to action with a homerun in the Cardinals' 3-2 win
over the Braves. Hornsby tore something in his knee in a game on May 8th,
and his knee was in a cast for two weeks. He'll leave tomorrow for 5 days
to visit his ailing mother.

1924
Giants 1B George "Highpockets" Kelly hits 3 HRs to drive in all 8 New York
runs in an 8-6 win over the Reds. It is the second time that Kelly has
smacked three homers in a game, the first 20th-century player to accomplish
the feat. After his last homer sails into the bleachers at the Polo Grounds,
Kelly is mobbed by fans before reaching 2B, and he opts to head straight
for the center field clubhouse. Umpire Ernie Quigley warns Kelly about not
touching all the bases but head ump Hank O'Day overrules Quigley and says
it is the call of the official scorer. NL Prexy Heydler later rules the hit
a homerun, but admonishes Kelly for not rounding the bases and promises a
clarification of the rules. Kelly's one-man offensive - a ML record for all
runs driven in by one player - will be matched by Bob Johnson on June 12,
1938. The win allows the Giants to move into a first-place tie with the Cubs.

The Yankees regain first place with a 6-2 win over the Tigers, but 10 days
later the Senators will pass both of them.

The Indians Pat McNulty swipes home in the 11th inning to give the Tribe
a 3-2 victory over the Red Sox. Stan Coveleski is the winner in relief.

1926
The Giants trade OF Billy Southworth, hitting .328, to the Cards for
part-time OF Heinie Mueller. This will prove to be a key trade for the Cards.

Red Sox pitcher Red Ruffing hits the first of his 36 ML homers, connecting
off Detroit's Hooks Dauss in an 8-7 loss to Detroit. The future Hall of
Famer will be 3rd on the list of homer-hitting hurlers.

1927
The St. Louis Star reports the following change in ground rules at Sportsman's
Park:  "A change has been made in the rule which allowed a batter a homerun
if he hit a ball behind the projecting wire screen, which guards the bleacher
and pavilion wall. Hereafter, it will be a three-base hit in Cardinal games
as in the American League games." (as noted by Wayne Townsend)

1928
The Braves change the rules and stop the homer orgy that has racked up 48
homers in 15 home games. The ground rules are changed today so that any balls
hit into the LF grand stands are ground rule doubles. The cardboard stands
will soon be demolished, but today four balls are hit there in the Cards'
3-2 win. St. Louis wins in the 9th when Jim Bottomley triples and Chick
Hafey follows with a homer, both off reliever Joe Genewich. Cy Pfirman is
pelted with bottles in the 4th inning after thumbing manager Rogers Hornsby
for protesting a 3rd strike call.

1931
Cardinal vet Taylor Douthit, with 2 hits in his last 2 at-bats yesterday,
collects 7 straight hits in today's doubleheader win over the Phillies and
drives in 6 runs. His reward will come tomorrow when he's informed that
he's been traded to the Reds for Wally Roettger in a move to make room for
Pepper Martin.

1932
New York edges Cleveland, 7-6, and the Yankees pull off a triple steal with
Ben Chapman on the front end.

1933
At Boston, Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak survives, even though he and
manager McCarthy are thrown out of a game in the 7th inning for protesting
that Boston's Rick Ferrell ran out of the baseline between 1B and 2B. Joe
McCarthy is suspended for 3 games but Gehrig's streak, now at 1,249,
continues. Gehrig is 1 for 3 with a triple in the 13-5 loss to Tommy Bridges.

1934
The Red Sox sell a star player unknowingly. They peddle infielder Bucky
Walters to the Phillies where he will convert to pitcher and subsequently
win the 1939 MVP with the Reds.

Yankee P Johnny Broaca, two weeks out of Yale University, gives up a
3rd inning single to Sammy West, the only St. Louis hit, to top the host
Browns, 7-0.

1935
Playing for Kansas City (AA), 1932 AL batting champ Dale Alexander hits 4
successive HRs, mostly off future ML hurler Steve Sundra at Minneapolis'
Nicollet Park. KC wins 15-2 on 22 hits. Also in the AA, Milwaukee leadoff
hitter Eddie Marshall goes hitless, ending his 43-game hitting streak. His
mark is a new AA record. During the streak, Marshall hit .327 (66 for 202).

1936
The Yankees trade All Star centerfielder Ben Chapman, who briefly was a
spring holdout, to the Senators for OF Jake Powell. Powell hit .312 with
98 RBIs in 1935, and will take over in CF, with DiMaggio moving from LF to RF.

Hal Schumacher allows 5 hits in stopping the Pirates, 8-0. Pirates 1B
Gus Suhr completes a string of 70 consecutive errorless games for a NL
record. He'll drop one tomorrow against the Dodgers.

Behind Lon Warneke, the Cubs beat the Braves, 3-1, for their 11th consecutive
win.

1939
Veteran OF Earl Averill is swapped by Cleveland to Detroit for Harry
Eisenstat and cash.

1940
At the Polo Grounds, Harry Danning hits for the cycle becoming the last player
to have an inside-the-park homer as part of this rare feat. The Giant catcher
is able to circle the bases because the ball gets stuck behind the Eddie Grant
memorial and Pirates' center fielder Vince DiMaggio cannot free it in time.

In the Bees' 4-2 win over the Cubs, Boston 1B Buddy Hassett fouls out in
the 8th inning after hitting safely in 10 straight at-bats over 3 games. He
walked once in the streak. Before the game, Boston sends C Al Lopez to
Pittsburgh for C Paul Burris and cash.

Luke Hamlin holds the Reds to two hits and Brooklyn wins, 2-0, to take over
first place from the Reds. Joe Medwick's safety drives in the first run,
and Vosmik Joe adds another.

In his first appearance as Ray Blades' successor, new Cardinal manager
Billy Southworth wins a 6-2 verdict over the Phillies. New Card Ernie Koy
has two hits to lead a 9-hit attack for Bob Bowman.

Gordon Cobbledick breaks the story in the Cleveland Plain Dealer about
the players' mutiny against Oscar Vitt. Vitt meets with owner Bradley but
declines to comment on the mutiny. He will stay on and today the players
hand him an 8-0 win over Detroit. Johnny Allen tosses a two-hitter.

1941
Brooklyn takes the 2nd game against the Cards, scoring 7 runs in the 6th

Clyde Kluttz.

1946

the Mackmen push across 2 runs to beat the Tribe, 5-3, at Cleveland. The
Chief walks 10 and strikes out 10.

The Yankees sell veteran Hank Majeski to the A's. Considered over the hill,
Majeski will play another 9 seasons.

1947
The Reds swipe pitcher Ken Raffensberger and C Hugh Poland from the Phillies
for C Al Lakeman. Lakeman won't hit his weight (195 pounds) in 2 seasons
in Philadelphia while Raffensberger will win 89 games in a Reds uniform.

1949
Bob Feller wins his 2nd of the year as the Indians route the Red Sox at
Boston, 10-5. The Tribe scores 6 runs in the 1st off Joe Dobson, who does
not retire a batter. Joe Gordon's grand slam is the big blow. The inning is
marred by a rhubarb with both teams milling around the mound after Dobson
hits Boudreau, who is playing 1B for the first time. The Sox allow Ken
Keltner as a courtesy runner for the Indians skipper, who returns after
an inning. Keltner, who had scored earlier in the inning, scores again for
Boudreau. He's the last courtesy runner this century.

Despite a Cards triple play in the 1st inning on a Hodges line drive, the
Dodgers win, 7-2, for their 8th straight win. The Brooks increase their
lead to 3 games in the NL.

After hitting a homer, triple and single, Wally Westlake adds a 2-out RBI
double in the 9th to complete the cycle and give the Pirates a 4-3 win
against visiting Boston.

Behind the 4-hit pitching of Larry Jansen, the Giants hand the Reds their
7th straight loss, 2-0. Walker Cooper, making his first appearance for the
Reds, grounds into a DP to end the game. Cooper's replacement behind the
plate for the Giants, Wes Westrum, is 1 for 4. Westrum set an IL record
with 5 grand slams, playing in just 51 games before being recalled.

Following a 4-1 Phils victory at Wrigley Field, Eddie Waitkus, 1B of the
Phillies, is shot with a rifle by 19-year-old Ruth Ann Steinhagen at Chicago's
Edgewater Beach Hotel. The shooting occurs just before midnight. Steinhagen,
obsessed with Waitkus, is registered at the hotel under the name Ruth Ann
Burns. Waitkus played with the Cubs and, apparently, Steinhagen is upset
and agitated because the All-Star infielder was traded to the Phillies. The
bullet punctures Waitkus' lung and lodges near his heart. Waitkus battles
for his life and will undergo 4 operations. He'll come back to play the
following season, though he will not be the same ball player. With a .304
batting average, Waitkus is currently leading the NL All-Star voting for 1B.

1950
No it wasn't football, as the Dodgers and Pirates game ends unfinished
at curfew time with the score, 19-14, in favor of Brooklyn. The game will
resume August 1st. Bucs rookie Dale Coogan starts the scoring in the 1st
with his first ML homer, a 3-run clout off Ralph Branca.

1952
Warren Spahn of the Braves ties the NL record of Jim Whitney (set on this date
68 years ago) with 18 strikeouts against the Cubs in a 15-inning complete game
effort. Hal Jeffcoat's 2-run triple wins it, 3-1, for the Cubs, while Spahn's
HR is the only Boston score. The Braves manage just 4 hits. On the same day,
Braves scout Dewey Griggs signs a Mobile, Alabama youth named Henry Aaron.

Little Bobby Shantz scores his 11th victory in 12 starts, and 10th in a row,
with a 9-2 win over the 7th-place Browns. However, the A's lose 21-year-old
third baseman Hal Bevan, purchased last month from the Red Sox, who breaks
his leg sliding home. Bevan is out for the year and will next appear with
the '55 Kansas City A's.

1953
White Sox hurlers Billy Pierce and Sandy Consuegra throw shutouts at
the Red Sox in a doubleheader, winning 6-0 and 1-0. Pierce's gem is a
2-hitter. Chicago also picks up 2 players from the Browns, getting veterans
3B Bob Elliott and P Virgil Trucks for P Lou Kretlow, C Darrell Johnson
and $75,000. St. Louis had obtained Trucks only 6 months ago from Detroit.

The Yankees sweep the Indians 6-2 and 3-0 before 74,708 to extend their
winning streak to 18 games. Berra paces the pinstripers with a homer in the
opener and a triple in game 2. New York now leads the Indians by 10 1/2 games.

At Brooklyn, the Cubs' Ralph Kiner belts a 2-out 9th-inning grand slam to
tie the Brooks, 6-6. The game is called after 9 because of darkness. The
Dodgers win the opener, 6-3, but the tie drops them out of a deadlock for
1st place with the Braves. Kiner's slam is his 12th, tying him with Hornsby
for the NL record.

The Phils and Reds split a pair at Philadelphia, with the Reds managing just
4 hits off Robin Roberts in the opener, but winning, 2-1. Ken Raffensberger
is the winner. Grady Hatton hits a leadoff homer off Roberts (10-4), and
adds a HR in the nitecap, a 4-1 win by Karl Drews. Phils 2B Connie Ryan
plays the entire 18 innings without a putout, tying a ML mark.

1956
Frank 'Trader' Lane lives up to his nickname when the Cardinals' GM completes
a seven-player deal with the Giants. The Redbirds swap future Hall of

Littlefield to the Jints for shortstop Alvin Dark, outfielder Whitey Lockman,
backstop Ray Katt and left-hander Don Liddle.

The University of Minnesota Gophers defeat Arizona 12-1 at the NCAA finals

his 28th victory in only 70 days. He wins 20 games or more for his 8th
consecutive season.

The Cardinals obtain P Sal Maglie (1-1) from the Yankees for Joe McClain
and $25,000. For Maglie, who will go 3-7 for the Cards, this will be his
4th straight year of pitching in both leagues, a ML record.

In the 2nd inning at Wrigley Field, Reds manager Birdie Tebbets reacts
to a sac bunt situation by switching second baseman Johnny Temple and 1B
George Crowe. Crowe continues to wear his first baseman's mitt. Temple
charges the plate, catching Johnny Briggs popped up bunt, and throws to
Crowe at first for a double play. Cubs manager Bob Scheffing protests the
move, but when the Cubs win 4-3, he withdraws the protest. The next day,
NL president Warren Giles rules that a first baseman switching to another
position must discard his mitt in favor of a glove (as noted by Cliff Blau).

1959
Ken Boyer of the Cards hits his 3rd weekly inside-the-park HR, this one
against the Reds at St. Louis in a 5-4 first-game win. On May 30 he connected
at Los Angeles and June 7 at Philadelphia.

Boston manager Pinky Higgins benches Ted Williams in a scheduled double
header with Kansas City. The Splinter, hitting just .175, has been slowed
by injuries. Williams will pinch hit in the next 2 games. The Sox win, 6-1,
with cold and rain postponing game 2.

At New York, the Tigers sweep a pair from New York, 3-2 and 8-2. Charlie
Maxwell unleashes his Sunday punch in the opener, hitting a 3-run homer in

his 3rd of the year against the Yankees. Paul Foytack is the winner in game
2. Al Kaline has 3 hits in each game.

1960

with the Indians and Orioles for 1st place.

Bunning strikes out 13 in 7 innings, but gives up a HR to Ted Williams, #498,

beats Boston, 2-1.

The Cubs sign Danvars, Massachusetts high school superstar Danny Murphy
(.489: 11-0) to a $130,000 contract, making him the highest paid player of
the bonus era so far. In 4 days, the 17-year-old will start in the outfield
at Crosley Field when the Reds' Jay Hook stops the Cubs, 7-1. Murphy will
hit just .120 this year and after three seasons drop to the minors. He'll
resurface as a pitcher with the White Sox in 1969, one of the few players
to make the majors as a position player and pitcher.

In Juarez, Mexico, actress Lorraine Day obtains a divorce from Leo
Durocher. The two wed on January 20, 1947.

1961
Sound familiar? The KC A's ship P Bud Daley, their top winner the past 2
seasons, to the Yankees for P Art Ditmar and OF Deron Johnson. The Yanks
then send P Danny McDevitt to the Twins for infielder Billy Gardner.

1962
Join the club. The Orioles Charlie Lau ties an AL record with 3 passed balls
in the 8th inning, and a total of 4, but Baltimore beats Boston 7-4. Lau
now shares the team (and AL) record with Myron Ginsberg and Gus Triandos
for most passed balls in an inning, all catching Hoyt Wilhelm. The 20th
century mark is 4 in an inning, set by the Giants' Ray Katt in 1954. No
surprise who was on the mound then - Wilhelm.

1963
In a 10-3 win over the Reds at Crosley field, Met outfielder Duke Snider hits
his 400th career homer off of Bob Purkey. With his sweet left-handed swing,

407 round-trippers.

Cleveland wins a 19-inning 3-2 game-2 over the Senators as Willie Kirkland
blasts two extra-inning homers, in the 11th and 19th. He matches Vern
Stephens' ML record as the second ML player to accomplish the feat. The 19
innings matches the longest game ever played in Cleveland.

The Giants win their second in a row by a 2-1 score, winning with the same
formula:  one left on base. Tom Haller has a homer, one of three SF hits. The
2 men left on base ties the record for fewest left on base in two consecutive
games. The NL mark was set by the Giants in 1960, also in two wins.

1964
The Yankees complete a 5-game sweep of the White Sox with two victories,
8-3 and 4-3 (in 10), at the Stadium. Chicago falls to 2nd place behind
the Orioles.

1965
No-hit pitching and 18 strikeouts, tying the NL extra-inning record, net
Cincinnati's Jim Maloney a 0-0 tie with the last-place Mets through 10
innings. Johnny Lewis' 11th-inning lead-off HR gives New York and Larry
Bearnarth, in relief of Frank Lary, a 1-0 win and a heartbreaking loss for
Maloney. Maloney allows one other hit and is the 10th pitcher to lose a
no-hitter in extra innings; Harvey Haddix was the last, in 1959. Maloney
walks one to go with his 18 strikeouts.

1966
Detroit acquires P Earl Wilson and OF Joe Christopher from Boston for OF
Don Demeter and P Julio Navarro.

Miami ekes out a 4-3 triumph over St. Petersburg (Florida State League),
managed by Sparky Anderson, in 29 innings. It finishes at 2:29 a.m.,
the longest game not interrupted by a suspension of play in the history
of organized ball (the Pawtucket marathon in 1981 is the longest). At two
o'clock the umpires announcement that the game will not continue past 30
innings is greeted by jeers of "more! more!" by the 150 fans still up.

1969
After playing nine years in New York, Tom Tresh is traded by the Yankees

With a 21-7 rout of the Red Sox at Fenway Park, the Oakland A's regain first
place in the AL West. Reggie Jackson hits 2 HRs and drives in 10 Oakland
runs. Reggie doubles home a run in the 1st, homers in the 3rd and 5th,
each time with Reynolds on base, strikes out with the bases loaded in the
6th and singles in 2 with the sacks full in the 7th. Reg drives in 3 with
a single in the 8th on a hit that he could easily have stretched into a
double, but he paused to admire it thinking he had a homer. Odom is the
easy winner. The 21 runs is a team record that won't be matched until 2000.

1972
In another tight pitching duel, the Orioles' Dave McNally wins, 2-1, over
the A's Catfish Hunter when Bobby Grich hits a 10th inning homer. The O's

The right-hander's performance will be the first of three 19 strikeout
outings the Texan throws this season.

1975

1978
The Phillies trade outfielders Jay Johnstone and Bobby Brown to the Yankees
for right-hander Rawly Eastwick (who was a disappointment after New York

risk losing him.

goes 5 innings for the Cubs to take the loss. The last complete game debut
was by Boston's Nate Minchley, who beat the Indians 11-1 on September 12,
1993. The last NL complete-game debut was by Pittsburgh's Tim Wakefield,
who beat the Cards, 3-2, on July 31, 1992.

ago. Estes throws his first pitch behind Clemens. Piazza answers in his own

Rocket. Roger leaves in the 6th after hurting his foot sliding into 2B on
a double.

Houston evens its series with the Texas Rangers as Wade Miller pitches
7 scoreless innings in the 4-0 win. He allows 3 hits including a double
in the fifth inning by Rafael Palmeiro, the 1,000th extra-base hit of his

to reach the 1000-hit mark. The 31-year-old Mariners outfielder also holds
the record in Japan for being the quickest player to attain 1,000 hits,
reaching the milestone in 757 games.

Before a pitch in the seventh inning, Frank Robinson asks the umpires
to investigate Brendan Donnelly's glove for foreign substances. Upon
the discovery of illegal pine tar, the Angel pitcher, who claims he uses
the substance to control sweating, is tossed resulting in managers Mike
Scioscia and Frank Robinson exchanging angry words which incites a brawl
clearing both benches and bullpens. The Nationals down the Angels, 6-3.
Robinson and Scioscia have to be physically separated. Donnelly will be
suspended for 10 days for the offense.

one-hitter. Russ Adams' 2-out double in the 6th inning is Toronto's only
safety.

Foulke combine on a one-hitter. Ryan Freel's 6th-inning single is the only
Cincinnati hit.

2006
Russ Ortiz (0-5, 7.54) becomes the highest paid player ever to be cut by a
major league team. Although the team still owes $22 million of the $33 million
of the four-year deal signed in December 2004, the Diamondbacks designate
the 32-year-old righty for assignment, meaning the club has 10 days to trade,
waive or release the pitcher who has a 1-14 record in his last 19 starts.

The Rockies down the Nationals, 14-8. Colorado's Cory Sullivan becomes the
8th player in ML history with 4 sacrifice bunts in a game.

Dodgers in 1954.

2014
Jimmy Rollins becomes the Phillies' all-time hits leader when he singles
in the fifth against Chicago's Edwin Jackson for his 2,235th hit for
the 132-year-old franchise. At the end of the frame, the 35-year-old
switch-hitting shortstop is greeted with a high-five and a hug at first base
by Mike Schmidt, the Hall of Famer whose total he surpassed to set the mark,
with the entire team then coming out from the Philadelphia dugout to offer
their congratulations on the milestone hit.
