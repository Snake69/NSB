1901
Milwaukee P Bill Reidy surrenders 10 consecutive hits to the Boston Somersets
with two outs in the 9th inning to set a ML record. Nine runs score, a
ML-record-tying number set a week ago, as Milwaukee loses 13-2. Boston pitcher
Charlie Beville, who took over at 1B in the 5th after Jimmy Collins and
Buck Freeman had been tossed by umpire Haskell for arguing and kicking dirt,
contributes two doubles - the only hits of his career - in the big inning.

1902
Baltimore scores 9 runs in the 3rd inning of a 14-1 victory as Cleveland kicks
in 6 errors, the most boots in one inning by any club in the 20th century.

In a 12-0 win, the Senators unload 3 homers in the 3rd inning against White
Sox P Clark Griffith as Ed Delahanty, Bill Coughlin and George Carey belt
the Old Fox, though not consecutively. After Wyatt Lee doubles, Griffith
takes himself out. According to the Chicago Daily Tribune, a Washington fan
had offered each member of the Nationals an expensive panama hat for their
first shutout and a $50 bonus to whichever pitcher performed the feat. With
little chance to win in the 9th, Chicago "allowed themselves to be put
out without effort" so that the Washington players could win their prize
(as noted by Greg Beston).

After the team loses 14 of the last 15 games in May, the Giants strip Jack
Doyle of his captain's role and give the job to George Smith. Doyle will
be released in late June.

1903
With Honus Wagner filling in for ailing manager Fred Clarke, reportedly
recuperating from a nervous breakdown, the Pirates beat the Giants,
7-0. Deacon Phillippe goes all the way, striking out 8 batters, including
the side in the 5th. Wagner is 3 for 5 for the Buccaneers. Frank Bowerman
is tossed out for protesting calls.

9th win since the start of the season.

1906
Only 3 games separate the Cubs from the 4th-place Phillies, and Cubs owner
Murphy again goes to Cincinnati for help. This time he comes back with Orval
Overall, a 6-foot 2-inch 225-pound righthander who is 4-5 for the Reds. The
price:  pitcher Bob Wicker, winner of 50 games the past 3 seasons, and
$2,000. Orval will go 12-3 overall for the Cubs and will help pitch them into
4 World Series in 5 years, while Wicker will wind up his career this year.

1908
During a game with the Pirates, a bottle of ammonia explodes in the face of

1913
In the 2nd game of a doubleheader with the A's, Walter Johnson serves up a
4th-inning homer to Home Run Baker as the Senators lose 4-3. The A's also

At the Polo Grounds, Babe Ruth and the traveling Red Sox stop the Yankees,
7-1. Today's game is the last stop on a 29-day road trip for the Sox. Ruth
allows 5 hits and bangs his 2nd ML homer, a 3-run shot, again connecting off
Jack Warhop. After his 2nd inning drive, the Babe is given two intentional
walks. Ruth ends up kicking the bench and breaking his toe, sidelining him
for 2 weeks.

In the 5th, Giants 2B Larry Doyle hits a long fly to RF off Braves P Bob
Crutcher with the winning run on 3B. Doyle crosses 1B and as the throw to
the plate comes in, he inexplicably catches the ball, and the runner is
called out for interference. The games ends in a 10-inning 5-5 tie.

1916
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants lose to the Reds in 13 innings, 6-4. The

the 13th is on Hal Chase's steal of home.

The Browns deal Charlie Deal to the Cubs, where he will be their starter
at third base for 5 years.

1918
Facing only 28 batters, Dutch Leonard tosses his second career no-hitter as
he holds the Tigers hitless in the Red Sox' 5-0 victory at Navin Field. 'Hub'
had also pitched a no-no against the Browns two seasons ago at Fenway Park.

both are there 11 innings later when Cleveland pushes over a 2-out score
to win, 1-0.

connecting off Tom Zachary and Carlson. Babe bangs another, his 14th, in the
nitecap off Snyder, but the Senators win 7-6. Milan homers in the 1st game,
while Meusel, Shanks, Ruel and Roth all homer in game 2. The New York Times
notes that "Ruth is the only player in the game who has the handle of his
bat wound with tape. It gives him a better grip."

1921
Reds OF Pat Duncan is the first to hit a fair ball out of Redland Field since
it was built in 1912, the ball hitting the leg of a surprised policeman
on York Street. The spacious ballpark will later become known as Crosley
Field. Duncan will hit just one more homer all year. The homer, off Cards
P Marv Goodman, propels the Reds to an 8-5 win.

The Athletics waive pitcher Dave Keefe to Cleveland, where he'll have no
decisions in 18 appearances. Keef is the inventor of the forkball, a result
of a childhood accident, which left his fingers crooked.

1922
The Browns' Urban Shocker scatters 14 hits, while the Browns tally the same
number in beating Chicago, 12-4. Ken Williams homers in the Browns 7-run 3rd.

but the Nationals coast to an 8-3 win.

1925
1B Wally Pipp is hit on the head in batting practice, resulting in a severe

Pittsfield (MA) team.

bows to the Reds, 20-12.

St. Mary's College football star Larry Bettencourt breaks in at 3B with
the Browns in a 5-2 win over the Senators. A future member of the College
Football Hall of Fame, Bettencourt was an All-American center who will
later play for the Green Bay Packers. The $6,000 bonus he receives is a
record for a rookie just out of school.

The Phillies defeat the Cardinals 12-11, as the two teams use 37 players
and combine for 6 homers. Jim Bottomley blasts two and Wattie Holm hits
a pinch grand slam in the 8th for the losers. The Phils counter with two
pinch homers to give Bill Sherdel the win over Sugar Sweetland.

In Boston, Braves 3B Les Bell takes advantage of the fences shortened
last year by smashing 3 HRs. A 4th hit bounces off the top of the RF wall
for a triple. Les drives home 6 runs, but Boston still loses to the Reds,
20-12. The Reds pound 6 pitchers for 23 hits, including 4 each by Chuck
Dressen and Wally Pipp, who scores 4 times. Sisler and Hornsby each have
3 hits, including Rajah's homer into the short first base bleachers. Pete
Donohue is the winner over Art Delaney in a 2-hour 30-minute contest.

1930
In a Central League game at Ft. Wayne, Springfield outkicks Ft. Wayne,

3 HRs and 3B Reagan has 3 homeruns.

1932
The Senators sweep a pair in Boston, beating the Red Sox, 6-4 and 8-1. Monte
Weaver wins the opener, handing Danny MacFayden his 14th straight loss
at the hands of the Nats. The 14 straight losses to one team ties the ML
record. Lefty Bob Burke wins the nitecap.

Buzz Arlett hits 4 consecutive HRs for Baltimore, as they edge Reading
14-13 in an IL game.

1934
The newly healed Dean brothers team up to beat the Pirates, 13-4. Paul
relieves Dizzy, who registers the win.

1935
Braves outfielder Babe Ruth announces his retirement from baseball. The
40-year-old former Yankees slugger wanted to retire three weeks sooner,
but team owner Emil Fuchs persuaded him to continue to play because Boston
hadn't played in every National League park.

P George Pipgras is released by the Red Sox and will later become an
AL umpire.

1936
In the first of 8 night games this season at Crosley Field, the host Reds
take an 8-2 lead into the 9th, but the Phillies score 6 times to tie, before
losing, 8-7. Ival Goodman's HR in the bottom of the 9th is the difference.

1937
NL President Ford Frick suspends Dizzy Dean for refusing to retract
statements made after a balk call in the May 19th game, which led to an
on-field brawl. Dean forces a meeting with the press at which he denies
the statements, and his suspension is lifted a few days later.

1939
The Reds score 4 in the 13th inning - 3 on a homer by Ernie Lombardi -
and outlast the Braves, 4-0.

1940
Bucky Walters wins his 9th in a row, 11-1 over the Bees, then Boston stings
the Reds in game 2, winning 2-0. Dick Erickson applies the whitewash,
though he is nearly matched by ex-Bee Jim Turner. Turner faces just 18
batters in the first six innings. Brooklyn takes a pair from the Cubs to
move two games in back of the first place Reds.

The Red and White Sox split a doubleheader in Boston. Ted Lyons wins the
opener, 6-0, for his 225th career victory. It is his 4th win this season. The
Red Sox come back in the nitecap, 10-8, when Jimmy Foxx cracks his 13th
homer of the year in the 9th inning into the LF screen with Ted Williams
on base. Boston stays two games ahead of Cleveland, which split today with
the A's.

1941
In Cleveland, the Indians defeat the Yankees, 7-5, behind Bob Feller. Feller
had been unscored upon in 31 innings before New York got to him. DiMaggio
has a single and double, improving his consecutive hit streak to 19 games,
and also robs Ken Keltner of an extra base hit with a running catch in
center. Later that day, upon their arrival in Detroit, the Yankees learn
the sad news that their captain, Lou Gehrig, seventeen days prior to his
38th birthday, has died in his sleep due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) in his Riverdale home. It was on this day exactly 16 years ago the
"Iron Horse" broke into the Bronx Bombers' starting line-up. From this time
on, the illness is known primarily as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

The Cards move back into sole possession of first with a 5-4 victory over
Brooklyn. Johnny Hopp triples, then scores the winner in the 9th.

The Senators beat Bill Dietrich, 8-3, to drop the White Sox from first
place. Buddy Lewis records two hits to reach the 1,000 level at age
24. However, he'll barely make 1500 hits because of three and a half years
lost to military service.

1942
Red Sox star Ted Williams enlists as a Navy aviator but he will finish the
season with the Sox as will many other players who enlist or await draft,
which moves slowly despite the early discouragements of the war. Among AL
regulars of 1941 who are now in the service:  Johnny Rigney, Joe Grace,
John Berardino, Cecil Travis, Bob Feller, Pat Mullin, Buddy Lewis, Sam
Chapman and Johnny Sturm.

Ted Williams hits 5 HRs in a week, but players are bemoaning a low-voltage
ball. HRs will be down for the season by more than 25 percent, and the NL
will average less than 4 runs a game per team for the first time since 1920.

1943
The Red Sox and the Browns play their 4th consecutive extra-inning game,
working 45 innings in 2 games on May 31 and another pair today. Sixth-place
Boston splits today, losing 7-4 and winning 3-2 to take 3 out of 4 from
last-place St. Louis. Both leagues will set records for extra-inning activity,
91 in the AL, 80 in the NL. Brownie P Denny Galehouse doesn't help in the game
2 loss, getting nabbed by 2B Bobby Doerr in the 8th on a hidden ball trick.

7th and 8th HRs in his last 10 games.

but the Pirates win 7-6. Vince will hit another slam on June 27.

and P Al Gettel from Cleveland for 3B Bob Kennedy.

1949
Against the Reds, the host Philadelphia Phillies hit 5 HRs in the 8th inning,
tying the ML mark set by the 1939 Giants and turn a 3-2 deficit into a
12-3 win. The Phillie 5 includes Del Ennis, Andy Seminick (2), Puddin'
Head Jones and Schoolboy Rowe. Jones adds a stand up triple which just
misses a HR, and Gran Hamner's double jumps the extra base total to 18,
a ML record. The 26 total bases ties the 20th century mark. Seminick has
a 3rd inning HR to total 3 for the game.

1950
The Tigers' George Kell hits for the cycle in the 16-5 second-game sweep
of a Detroit doubleheader with the A's. The Tigers cop the opener, 8-2,
behind the pitching of Ted Gray and the homeruns of Vic Wertz and Hoot
Evers. Wertz has 5 RBI in the opener, and 2 more in game 2.

The last-place Browns sweep 2 from the 5th place Senators, 10-5 and 9-3. Hank
Arft is 5 for 5 in the opener, while Harry Dorish is the winning pitcher
in game 2. Dorish swipes home on the front end of a double steal with Ray
Coleman. He is the last AL pitcher this century to steal home.

In a rain-soaked game in St. Louis, Don Newcombe and the Dodgers trim
the Birds, 8-1, to move into first place. Newk holds the Birds to 5 hits,
including Marty Marion's 3rd homer in 3 games he's started. Duke Snider's
2-run homer in the 6th helps drive Harry Brecheen to the showers. The Cards
and Phils are a game back.

Behind the 5-hit pitching of bonus baby Bill MacDonald (2-0), the Pirates
beat the Braves, 5-4, to stop a 9-game winning streak. Gene Mauch homers and
drives in 3 runs for Boston, while Ralph Kiner hits his 10th of the year,
off Warren Spahn.

Thanks to 5 Cincy errors, 2 passed balls, and 4 walks in the 9th inning by
Willie "The knuck" Ramsdell, the Giants beat the host Reds, 7-6.

In the first inning at Fenway, Cleveland's Bob Feller walks 5 - including
3 in a row - and yields two hits before exiting. The 6 runs allows the Red
Sox to romp, 11-5, behind Joe Dobson.

1951
During a game against the Durham Bulls, Mike Romello hits umpire Emil
Davidzuk after being called out for leaving third base early. A judge at

infielder will later be fined $25 for his assault on the arbitrator.

Due to the poor lighting during an Alabama-Florida League contest at Peanut
Stadium in Headland, Alabama, Ottis Johnson of the Dothan Browns fails to
get out of the way of a fastball thrown by Jack Clifton. The 24-year-old
Class D minor league outfielder undergoes surgery and spends eight days in
the hospital before dying on June 10 as a result of being hit by the Dixie
Runners hurler's pitch.

The 7th place A's hand the White Sox a 5-1 defeat, Chicago's first since May
13th. The first-place Sox had won 14 straight. Bob Hooper tops Joe Dobson,

to regain his form.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks tag Early Wynn for seven runs in the first
inning without the righty recording an out. Don Mossi relieves and starting
in the 2nd inning, the Yanks are held hitless against Mossi and four more
relievers. Cleveland pecks away, eventually tying the game before winning
in the 10th, 8-7. Hal Newhouser, who tosses the last three hitless innings,
is the winner.

The Dodgers score 5 unearned runs in the 5th good for a 7-6 rain-splashed
victory over the Braves, that ends after 5 innings. Moments after umpire

1958
In the bottom of the sixth inning with Orioles on first and second base of
an eventual 2-1 loss, Brooks Robinson lines into a triple play when Senator
shortstop Rocky Bridges snares the wicked drive, steps on second, and then
relays the ball to first baseman Julio Becquer to complete the play. It
is the first of four triple killings the future Hall of Fame third baseman
will hit into, a major league record. The Birds also lose hot-hitting Bob
Nieman who, while standing on 3B, is hit by a line drive off the bat of
Bob Boyd. It will slow him for 2 months.

Yankee P Whitey Ford fans 6 in a row to tie an AL record as he shuts out
the White Sox 3-0. Sox pitcher Jim Wilson allows just 6 hits but three
- 2 by Bauer and one by Mantle - are out of the Stadium. On a botched
hit-and-run attempt, Luis Aparicio is thrown out at 2B ending his streak
of 26 consecutive steals.

1959
At Comiskey Park, The Sox-Baltimore game is delayed 30 minutes due to a swarm
of gnats over the field. Groundskeepers tried bug spray to no avail before
bringing in the post-game fireworks display and attaching a smoke bomb to the
framework. It works, dispersing the gnats, and the O's dispense the Sox 3-2.

Houston erupts for 8 runs in the 12th inning at Cincinnati to win 11-4. The
clubs combine to tie a NL record by scoring 9 runs in the 12th. Reds manager

... all three - Tony Perez, Gordy Coleman and Art Shamsky - strike out. In
the 9th, P Billy McCool bats for himself and grounds out with the sacks

record by hitting 4 Cards in the game, the first time a pitcher has done
that since Moe Drabowsky on this same date in 1957 pitching for the Cubs.

In Philadelphia, the Phils edge the Padres, 9-8, in 12 innings when Ricky
Otero singles home the winner with two outs. Mark Whiten drives in 5 runs
for the winners on 2 homers. The first place Padres suffer a blow when
Wally Joyner fractures his left thumb sliding in the 4th inning. He will
be out of action for six weeks.

At Oakland, the Yankees win 11-4 and do it the old-fashioned way - by
stealing 8 bases. Gerald Williams, with 10 career steals, has 4 steals
to tie a club record, and rookie Derek Jeter adds 2. Kenny Rogers (4-1)
is the benefactor, pitching 6 1/3 innings for the win, as the Yankees stay
1 1/2 games ahead of the O's.

and knocks in four runs as Colorado beats the Cards, 11-7. Galarraga's
opposite-field three-run blast in the fifth is taped at 426 feet and gives
the Rockies a 6-0 lead. Cardinals starter Danny Jackson (1-1) walks the
first two batters before Galarraga unloads.

Chad Curtis on May 20th that injured Curtis' thumb and put him on the 15-day
DL. The Yanks will acquire Curtis in a week.

Mulder at No. 2; the Cubs take high school OF Corey Patterson with No. 3;
Stanford P Jeff Austin is grabbed by the Royals at No. 4; and last year's
top pick, J.D. Drew is selected by the Cardinals as No. 5. Drew will debut

the Cubs, but will sign too late to play in 1998, while Mulder will pocket
$3.2 million from the A's. At number 6, the Twins take Ryan Mills, the
losing pitcher for ASUN in the 21-14 loss to USC in the CWS. Picking 9th,

$3.625 million, while C Eric Munson, a Braves 2nd round pick in '96, goes

including all but one first rounder, will sign for $1 million or more; 76
players in the 1st ten rounds get $500,000 or more; 127 players sign for

as far as AAA this year - A's Barry Zito, a first rounder, and Diamondbacks
Jeremy Ward, a 2nd round pick. Other first rounders include Jason Jennings
(Rockies), Kurt Ainsworth (Giants), Ben Sheets (Marlins) and Matt Ginter
(Chicago). The Cardinals take Albert Pujols in the 13th round (402nd overall).

10-4. Matt Stairs hits a 3-run homer, while Sosa and Rondell White add 2-run

is the longest by the Cubbies since they won 15 in a row in 1936. The streak
ends tomorrow.

2002

by a score of 18-3. Philadelphia pitcher Robert Person gets the win, slugs

Carlos Tosca.

2003
In one of the minor league's strangest giveaways, the first 500 fans

of Famer has recently been cryogenically frozen.

The Marlins wallop the A's, 13-2. Oakland's Eric Byrnes has his 22-game
hitting streak snapped.

The Cubs edge the Devil Rays, 3-2, but the headline news is Sammy. Sosa is
ejected from the game in the 1st inning after apparently driving in a run
with a broken-bat ground out. Inspection of the bat reveals it to have cork
inside and the run is disallowed.

In the opening round of the June Draft, the Devil Rays pick first and
take high schooler Delmon Young, quickly inking him to a ML contract that
includes a $3.7 million bonus. His brother Dmitri was drafted 4th overall in

in the first two rounds will sign, though first round bonuses will average
$1.757 million, down from last year's average of $2.1 million. Only 16
players of the 307 drafted will not sign, a new record (24 in 2000 was the
previous mark). The Expos sign all 19 draftees. Picking 2nd, the Brewers
take 2B Rickie Weeks, who set a NCAA record with a career BA of .473. The

draftee Adam Loewen for $4.2 million, a week before they would lose his
rights, then take Nick Markalis with the #7 pick. The best debuts in this
class will be put in by Lou Palmisano (Helena, .394), a 3rd round pick of
Milwaukee, and Michael Aubrey (Lake County, .348), Cleveland's 1st round
pick. The Blue Jays' #2 pick, Josh Banks, will go 7-2 for Auburn.

2004
Vladimir Guerrero strokes 2 HRs and drives in a team-record 9 runs in the
Angels' 10-7 win over the Red Sox. Five of the RBIs come off Pedro Martinez,
who takes the loss for Boston, but does record the 2,500th strikeout of his
ML career in the process. He is the 26th pitcher to reach the mark. David
Eckstein gets 5 hits and scores 4 runs for the Angels as their top 3 hitters
(Guerrero - 4 for 4, Phillips - 3 for 4) go 12 for 13.

2008

known as the Kid, leaves the game fifth on the All-Time career homerun list
with 630 round-trippers.

After retiring 26 consecutive Cleveland batters, Tigers starter Armando
Galarraga appears to have hurled the season's third perfect game when the
throw from the first baseman to the pitcher, covering the bag, clearly
beats the baserunner for the final out, but umpire Jim Joyce emphatically
calls Jason Donald safe. After seeing the replay, the first base arbitrator
tearfully admits his error and apologizes to the 28-year-old Venezuelan
right-hander for his blown call.

The Angels' Bobby Abreu records his 500th career double in the 1st inning
against the Kansas City Royals. Abreu becomes the 51st player to reach
this mark.

At PNC Park, Garrett Jones became only the second player and the first
Pirate to hit a ball into Davy Jones' Locker on the fly when his two-run
eighth-inning round-tripper ties the score in the Bucs' eventual 5-4 win
over Cincinnati. In 2002, Houston's Daryle Ward also launched a shot that
splashed into the waters of the Allegheny River.
