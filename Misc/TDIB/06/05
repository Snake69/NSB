as Colorado belts visiting San Diego, 9-7. Walker has 3 hits to raise his
average to .411 and Colorado has a team-record six double plays to help
Steve Reed earn his 1st victory in relief.

Mo Vaughn's two-run homer, off Ben MacDonald, is all Tim Wakefield needs as
he subdues the Brewers, 2-1. He strands 12 runners but needs relief help for
the last out. The knuckleballer throws 170 pitches, 2 shy of his 1990s record
of 172 pitches, set with the Pirates in 1993. Wakey threw 166 pitches in 8
innings against the White Sox last year for the three highest pitch totals
in the 1990s (David Cone threw 166 against the Giants in 9 innings in 1992).

1999
Dodgers P Chan Ho Park, tagged out after a bunt, aims a kick at Angels
P Tim Belcher during a scuffle in the Dodgers' 7-4 victory. Park will be
fined $3,000 for his actions and suspended for 7 games. An inning after
the kick boxing incident Devon White hits a grand slam off Belcher.

The Braves score 2 runs in the top of the 9th inning to defeat the Red Sox,
6-5. Boston P Tom Gordon blows the save opportunity, ending his major league
record consecutive save streak at 54 games.

The Rockies defeat the Brewers, 12-11, as 3B Vinny Castilla hits 3 HRs and
drives home 5. Castilla also strokes a single in his 5 trips to the plate.

Mets manager Valentine reads in a newspaper report that pitching coach Bob
Apodaca is out, and, arriving at the park, discovers that, along with Apodaca,
GM Phillips has fired coaches Tom Robson and Randy Niemann. Phillips names
replacement coaches Dave Wallace, Al Jackson and Mickey Brantley.

2000
The Braves send P John Rocker to the minors, a day after his latest
confrontation with a reporter from Sports Illustrated.

In the 2000 amateur draft, the Marlins use the #1 pick on San Diego prep
16-year-old 1B Adrian Gonzales, who will sign for $3 million today. The Cubs,
picking 3rd, take Miami HS shortstop Luis Montanez. In between the 2 preps,
the Twins take righty Adam Johnson from Cal State-Fullerton. The Expos pick
Stanford's Justin Wayne with the 5th, while the Devil Rays go the prep route
taking Rocco Baldelli with the 6th selection. Baldelli was a 7-sports star,
including volleyball, in Warwick, RI. The Rockies, picking 7th select
prep fireballer Matt Harrington, but the team and high schooler will go
through months of contentiousness. Harrington will go back in the draft
next year and go through the same experience with the Padres. The Padres
take Cal-Berkeley infielder Xavier Nady, who will be the first draftee in 5
years to skip the minors and debut in the ML. Xavier signs late and goes 1
for 1 on September 30, win the Cal League MVP in 2001 before undergoing Tommy
John surgery. Picking 8th, the Tigers sign Matt Wheatland for $2.15 million,
but a shoulder injury limits him to 3 minor league wins. Picking 12th, the
White Sox take Stanford QB Joe Borchard, who will sign for $5.3 million, the
highest bonus in the draft, and give up football. The Expos sign Borchard's
Stanford teammate Justin Wayne, the #5 pick, for $2.5 million. The Giants
take P Boof Bonzer in the first round. Bonzer will tube this year and go
13-3 in the minors next year. The Braves start a good draft by using the
29th and 30th picks on two prep players:  Adam Wainwright and Canadian Scott
Thorman. Other picks in the low rounds are Anthony Gwynn, son of Tony, by
the Braves and Virginia Tech star QB Michael Vick, by the Rockies. Picking
in the 26th round, the Yankees select junior college P Sean Henn in a
draft-and-follow move. They will ink the lefty to a $1.7 contract next year.

2001
By homering in his team's 57th game, Barry Bonds becomes the fastest player
ever to hit 30 homeruns. In 1928, it took Babe Ruth 63 games to reach the
same mark.

The Red Sox edge the Tigers, 4-3, in 18 innings and 5 hours 52 minutes on
Shea Hillenbrand's HR over the Green Monster. Tim Wakefield, with a scoreless
inning, is the winner. Sox DH Manny Ramirez is handed 4 intentional walks,
tying the AL mark set by Roger Maris on May 22, 1962. Maris did it in a
12 inning game. The ML record is 5, by Andre Dawson, in a 16 inning game,
on May 22, 1990.

At Coors Field, Mike Hampton (8-2) beats Houston, 9-4, and hits a pair of
homers. Hampton, who came into the season homerless, now has 4 dingers.
The Mets, Hampton's team last year, have a combined 5 homers from their
outfielders.

Greg Maddux outduels Javier Vazquez to give the Braves a 3-1 win over the
Expos. The lone Expo run comes in the 4th inning when Maddux throws 2 wild
pitches, the only time in his career he's thrown 2 in one inning. Maddux
lost his last outing a week ago to Vazquez, but will go undefeated in June
and July.

The Phillies trade P Paul Byrd to the Royals for P Jose Santiago.

Picking first in the June free agent draft, the Twins pass over top
prospect Mark Prior and select Minnesota prep catcher Joe Mauer. Mauer
immediately signs a $5+ million contract. Later, the Twins will pick Joe's
older brother Jake. The Cubs then select USC's Prior who will eventually
sign a ML contract for $10.5 and debut in 2002. Tampa Bay takes RHP Dewon
Brazleton with the 3rd pick and will bring him up in September. The Phils take
high schooler Gavin Floyd with the #4, while the Rangers take the draft's
top hitter Mark Texeira, from Georgia Tech, with #5 and sign him for $9.5
for 4 years. Texeira, who graduated from Floyd's high school, missed most
of the 2001 season with a broken ankle, but was the player of the year in
2000. UCLA's Josh Karp goes to the Expos on #6. Picking 7th, the Orioles
choose pitcher Chris Smith, who will fail to win a game in pro ball. The
Pirates take Kent State slugger John Van Benschoten with #8. The Bucs plan
on converting the slugger to a pitcher. Kansas City picks prep fireballer
Colt Griffin, the first high school to hit 100-MPH on the radar gun, with
the #9. Picking 18th, the Mets take Notre Dame pitcher Aaron Heilman, who
turned down a $1.5 million offer from the Twins last year. New York will ink
him for slightly more. The Diamondbacks take P Jason Bulger in the first
round, and take his brother Kevin in the 43rd round. Third brother Brian
goes to the Giants in the 49th round. The Angels use the #13th pick to take
Casey Kotchman, son of Angels minor league manager Tom. The Mariners use
their top pick to take Michael Garciaparra, Nomar's brother. Several teams
passed on Garciaparra after he injured his knee last fall. In the 11th round,
Florida hopes for a hit by picking SS Rex Rundgren, son of 70s rocker, Todd
Rundgren. Cuban defector Rolando Viera, who lost a court case and had to go
through the draft, is taken by the Red Sox in the 7th round. At 27, he is
the oldest in the draft. The Expos take lefty Chad Benz in the 7th round;
Benz was born without a complete right hand. The Padres take pitcher Matt
Harrington in the 2nd round but will not sign him this year. Harrington
will sit out the summer and did the same in 2000 when he and the Rockies,
who took him #7 overall, could not reach an agreement. The A's, picking 25th,
take Jeremy Bonderman, the first high school junior ever selected. Bonderman
became eligible when he obtained his GED.

2002
Houston renames Astros Field to Minute Maid Park. The original name of the
stadium, Enron Field, was dropped in February when the team regains the
naming rights by making a deal to pay the debtors of the bankrupt energy
corporation the sum of $2.1 million.

Rangers designated hitter Juan Gonzalez becomes the 34th major leaguer,
and the first from Puerto Rico, to hit 400 career homeruns. The Juan Gone's
milestone is hit off Anaheim hurler Jarrod Washburn's first pitch in the
second inning during a 7-5 extra inning loss to the Angels.

The Giants batter the Padres, 12-2. Barry Bonds passes Frank Robinson to
become fourth on the all-time career homerun list when he belts his 587th
homerun. The historic grand slam, believed to be one of the longest homers
ever hit in the 34-year history of the ballpark now called Qualcomm Stadium,
puts the Giants' left fielder, the single-season homerun record holder with
73, exactly 73 behind Willie Mays' 660 round-trippers for third place.

High school players dominate the first round picks of the amateur draft as
16 of the 30 first rounders are prep stars. After Ball State righty Bryan
Bullington is taken with the first pick, the next 7 are high schoolers. Tampa
Bay takes SS Melvin Upton with the #2 pick; the Reds take P Chris Gruler
#3; the O's take LHP Adam Lower #4; the Expos choose P Clint Everts #5; KC
takes SS Don Greinke #6; and the Brewers pick first baseman Prince Fielder,
son of Cecil, with #7. Detroit takes SS Scott Moore at #8; and the Rockies
take British Columbian P Jeff Francis #9. The Padres pick Clemson SS Khalil
Greene with the #13 pick; and the A's, picking #16, take OSU 1B Nicholas
Swisher, son of Steve. With the 21st pick the Cubs choose Bobby Brownlie,
the #1 collegiate pitcher a year ago before injuries hit. He won't sign
until March of 2003. In the 12th round, the Twins select Marshalltown's Jeff
Clement, the high school homerun champion with a record 71 this year. He
broke the mark of 70 set by Drew Henson in 1998.

Baseball commissioner Bud Selig announces that the sport will contract by
at least two teams before the 2003 season. Doesn't happen.

2003
In the second game of a double-header loss to the Brewers, Mets southpaw John
Franco pitches an inning of relief to become the eighth pitcher to make a
thousand career appearances. The last time Milwaukee swept a doubleheader
on the road occurred eleven seasons ago when the Brewers of the American
League beat the Royals twice on July 5, 2002, 8-7 and 5-3.

Tony Clark changes his number from 00 to 52. The Mets' reserve player wanted
to give the team's mascot, Mr. Met, his identity back as he and the Mascot
shared double ought.

2004
Ken Griffey Jr hits his 496th career HR and Adam Dunn hits 2, including a
3-run shot in the 10th, as the Reds beat the visiting Montreal Expos.

Todd Helton and Royce Clayton hit 2-run homers to pace the Rockies to an 11-2
win over the Giants. Barry Bonds is walked 3 times, twice intentionally,
and hits a double. Yesterday, Jeff Fassero ignored manager Clint Hurdle's
instructions and pitched to Bonds, who hit his 15th homer.

2005
Mike Lieberthal's controversial 3-run HR in the 6th lifts the Phillies to a
6-5 win over the Diamondbacks. Lieberthal's hit is first ruled a double but
then is changed to a HR on appeal. Arizona manager Bob Melvin gets tossed
for arguing otherwise. Luis Gonzalez' 300th career HR in the 8th closes
the gap to 6-5.

2006
Reds slugger Ken Griffey Jr hits a homerun in his forty-third ballpark
to tie the major league record also held by Fred McGriff. Junior, who has
homered in every existing ballpark, goes deep twice in the new Busch Stadium,
including a ninth inning three-run game winner off Jason Isringhausen in
Cincinnati's 8-7 victory over the Redbirds.

2008
Joining Mickey Mantle and Eddie Murray, Chipper Jones becomes just the third
switch-hitter in major league history to hit 400 career home runs. The
milestone homer is just one of his four hits the Braves' third baseman
contributes to Atlanta's 7-5 comeback win over Florida.

At Nationals Park, Mark Worrell becomes the eighth player in Cardinals
history to hit a homerun in his first big league at-bat. The rookie reliever,
who also pitched two scoreless innings, hit his monstrous three-run blast
on a 3-2 pitch from Washington's Tim Redding in the sixth inning of a 10-9
St. Louis loss.

In a televised game at Fenway Park against the Rays, NESN cameras catch Manny
Ramirez and Kevin Youkilis fighting in the dugout. The altercation between
the Red Sox teammates is a result of Manny's taking exception to Youkilis'
demonstrative behavior after the third baseman returns to the bench after
striking out.

2009
Twitter reaches a settlement with Tony La Russa, who claimed an unauthorized
page on the site that used his name caused emotional distress by mocking
his DUI charge and minimizing the loss of two players who had died in
recent seasons. The Cardinals' manager drops his lawsuit when the social
network agreed to pay legal fees and to make a donation to his Animal
Rescue Foundation.

John Schuerholz publicly apologizes to Tom Glavine for the club's handling
of the southpaw's release. The Braves' president, who choose not to give the
300-game winner a million dollar bonus by adding him to the 25-man roster,
doesn't regret the decision, but for "the manner in which it was portrayed
and explained" to the veteran pitcher.

Just hours prior to its scheduled demise, Tiger Stadium is saved from
complete demolition when Wayne County Circuit Judge Isidore Torres stops
crews from tearing down what's left of the ballpark at the corner of Michigan
and Trumbull Avenues. A temporary restraining order, requested by the Old
Tiger Stadium Conservancy, gives the nonprofit group additional time to
raise money for preservation and redevelopment the historic ballpark.

Caught on video shouting profanities, Alex Rios apologizes for the incident
which occurred when he was leaving a Blue Jays' charity event. After
appearing to ignore a youngster's request for an autograph, the Toronto
right fielder shouts an epithet when he hears an older man comment, "The
way you played today Alex, you should be lucky somebody wants your autograph".

Carlos Zambrano of the Chicago Cubs wins his 100th career game against the
Cincinnati Reds.

2010
Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki scores his 1000th career run in the 5th inning against
the Los Angeles Angels. Ichiro becomes the 305th player to reach this mark.

2012
David Wright becomes the Mets all-time run scorer when he crosses the plate
for the 736th time after homering in the team's 7-6 loss in Washington. New
York's 29-year-old third baseman is already the franchise career leader in
doubles, total bases, RBIs and extra-base hits.

The Royals select Alfredo Escalera-Maldonado as the 8th pick in the MLB
June Amateur Draft making the 17-year-114-day old the youngest player to
ever be chosen. The 6'1" 180 pound outfielder/third baseman, a National
Honor Society student at the Pendleton School in Florida, is an unexpected
selection by Kansas City.

2013
The White Sox score five times in the top of the 14th inning, but the
Mariners knot the score in the bottom of the frame thanks to Kyle Seager's
two-out two-strike bases-loaded round-tripper. The third baseman's homer,
the first game-tying, extra-inning grand slam in major league history,
isn't enough when Chicago beats Seattle, 7-5, in the 16-inning Safeco Field
contest that takes 5 hours 42 minutes to complete.
