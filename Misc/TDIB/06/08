win in a row.

1903
Boston beats visiting Detroit, 6-1, in a game called after 5 1/2
innings. Detroit scores its only run when Long Tom Hughes issues four
straight walks. The win is Boston's 11th in a row.

Pittsburgh's Sam Leever shuts out the Phils, 2-0, beating Tully Sparks to
keep the scoreless streak alive. It is Leever's 2nd shutout during the Bucs'
skein of 56 straight innings, and he will lead the NL with 7 shutouts. Wagner
is 2 for 3 and saves the shutout with a game-ending snag in left center of
a line drive by pinch hitter Klondike Douglass.

1904
Iron Joe McGinnity nails his 14th straight win, beating the Pirates,
2-0. With the win, the Giants move into 1st place over Chicago.

1905
Red Ames, 22-year-old righthander, loses to Pittsburgh after winning 9 in
a row. A surprise winner for the Giants, Ames will have the best season of
his 19-year career, 22-8.

1906
The Giants redeem themselves with a 7-3 victory over the Cubs, their first
win in 4 games with Chicago. Brown, on short rest, gives up 7 hits and
walks 3. The Cubs now lead by 3 1/2 games.

1907
The National Police Gazette lists "Honest John" Kelly and Tim Hurst among
its great boxing referees. Both are former ML umpires, with Kelly also
playing and managing.

1908
Iron Joe McGinnity rights himself and tosses a 4-0 six-hitter against the
Cards. Joe's name had been in the trading mills.

1909
At Chicago, the Cubs score two runs off Mathewson in the first inning with
the help of two errors, but tally just one hit in the next 8 innings. Matty
emerges with a 3-2 win over Three Finger Brown, his first win against Brown
since 1903.

San Francisco (Pacific Coast League) hurler Cack Henley tosses a 24-inning
1-0 shutout over Oakland, surrendering only 9 hits and one walk in the
3-hour 35-minute contest. Jimmy Wiggs matches Henley for 23 frames before
Nick Williams drives home the winner with a single in the 24th. In the
only other game scheduled in the league, Portland and Sacramento play an
18-inning 1-1 tie.

1911
The Cards chase Bugs Raymond and the Giants, scoring 8 runs in 6 innings off
Bugs. McGraw is furious with Raymond, suspecting him of drinking again. He
suspends him and fines him $200. A week from now, Raymond will turn up in
Connecticut, making a lone pitching appearance for the hamlet of Winsted
in a 4-0 loss to Torrington. Bugs will return to the Giants where he'll be
used sparingly.

At St. Louis, 4 Browns batters reach base on errors in the 4th inning and
St. Louis beats the Red Sox, 11-5.

In the White Sox game against the host Hilltoppers in New York, pitcher
Russ Ford hits Sox SS Roy Corhan on the head with a pitch (as noted by
Retrosheet). New York manager Hal Chase allows Ping Bodie as a courtesy
runner for Corhan, even though Bodie is already in the lineup. In the
bottom of the frame, Bodie returns to CF, with Tannehill moving from 1B to
SS. Pitcher Doc White finishes at 1B.

In a Mountain States League game at Huntington, Charleston beats Huntington,
1-0, in 11 innings behind a no-hitter by Niehaus. George W. Baumgarner of
Huntington matches him for 10 hitless innings before giving up 3 hits in
the 11th. Niehaus strikes out 16 batters and Baumgarner 14 batters.

1914
It is a good thing his bat is not needed as Boston Red Sox P Hugh Bedient
strikes out 4 times against 4 different Cleveland pitchers in an 11-8 win.

1917
After a game in Cincinnati, John McGraw takes a swing at umpire Bill "Lord"
Byron as they are leaving the field, splitting Byron's lip. NL President
John Tener fines McGraw $500 and suspends him for 16 days. McGraw sounds
off to writer Sid Mercer about the general shortcomings of Tener and his
umpires. When McGraw's quotes are published, he signs a statement denying
he'd said what was printed. The Baseball Writers Association protests,
forcing another NL meeting at which Tener finds McGraw guilty and fines
him another $1,000. Mercer, a friend of McGraw's, quits the beat and never
speaks to McGraw again.

1920
Failing in his efforts to buy Rogers Hornsby from St. Louis, John McGraw
picks up the NL's top SS, Dave Bancroft, from the Phils for veteran SS Art
Fletcher, P Bill Hubbell and $100,000. The future Hall of Famer will provide
the spark to the Giants' successful pennant drives of 1921-24. Following
the death of his father, Fletcher will retire after this season to run the
family business, then return in 1922 for a final year. Fletch plays his
first game with the Phils and has a double and single off Pete Alexander
as the Phils top the Chicago ace, 5-3. Gene Paulette's three-run homer in
the 8th, his only homer of the year, is the game winner.

The Indians maintain their lead with a 7-5 win over the A's. Evans and
Speaker have three hits each to back Earl Caldwell's pitching.

At the Polo Grounds, the Reds' Edd Roush falls asleep in CF during a
long argument in the infield. Heinie Groh goes out to wake him, but the
ump ejects Roush for delaying the game. As a result of the long argument,
McGraw announces that he will file a protest if the Giants lose. But they
don't, winning 5-4 behind Jesse Barnes.

The Senators beat the Browns, 5-3, with the help of some ragged St. Louis
fielding. Walter Johnson is the winner over Al Sothoron, putting the Nationals
ahead in the 7th with a homerun into the RF bleachers. Ken Williams and
George Sisler hit homers for the Browns off Johnson.

Former Reds pitcher Pete Schneider, now with Beaumont (Texas), denies that
he was implicated with Lee Magee and Hal Chase in an alleged plan to throw a
July 25, 1918 game to Boston when he was with the Reds. Schneider said that
before the game in question, Sherry Magee told him "he'd better be careful"
because he (Magee) understood that some of the Reds players were betting
on Boston. "If that's so, I won't work today," Schneider supposedly said
to Magee. Schneider said he was not approached by Lee Magee or Hal Chase
prior to the first game of 2 (New York Times) in which he ended up not
pitching. He threw a shutout in the nitecap. The two Magees - unrelated,
Chase and Schneider were teammates on the Reds in 1918.

The Braves sell INF Johnny Rawlings to the Phillies.

1921
Babe Ruth is arrested for speeding in New York, fined $100, and held in
jail until 4:00 P.M. Game time is 3:15, so a uniform is taken to him. He
changes in jail and follows a police escort to the ballpark where he enters
with New York trailing 3-2. They rally for a 4-3 win.

1922
Red Sox Elmer Smith hits a grand slam off the Browns' Elam Vangilder as the
Sox build a 7-1 lead, Tobin homers, but the 2nd place Browns fall short, 7-5.

1923
Browns C Pat Collins leaves the game after pinch-running in the 3rd inning,
but, as a courtesy, A's manager Connie Mack gives the okay to allow him to
come back as a pinch hitter for starting P Ray Kolp in the 9th. He walks,
setting an odd ML mark of being the only player to pinch run and pinch hit
in the same game. But St. Louis loses 6-5 to reliever Rube Walberg.

1924
Elementary. Giants pitcher John Watson connects for a 2nd inning grand slam
off Pirate hurler Johnny Morrison, and shuts out Pittsburgh, 7-0.

1926
In Detroit, Babe Ruth slugs a HR reported to carry 626 feet, in the Yanks
11-9 slugfest over the Tigers. The hit, off Tiger P Lil Stoner, lands at
the intersection of Cherry Street and Brooklyn Avenue, two blocks from Navin
Field. The youngster who retrieves the ball sells it to the Babe for $20.

1927
Tony Lazzeri clouts three homers (the first Yankee to hit 3 homers in one
game) in the Yankees 11-inning 12-11, win over the White Sox. Tony's first 2
round trippers come off Red Faber, and his 3rd is a 2-run line drive in the
9th inning off George Connally that ties the game. The Yanks were behind,
11-6, going into the 9th inning. New York wins it in the 11th after Cedric
Durst triples, Lazzeri is intentionally walked, and Ray Morehart singles
over Barrett's head in RF.

1928
Braves OF Eddie Brown is benched, ending his record (NL) 618-game playing
streak. The Braves pound out 17 hits with Brown's replacement Jack Smith
going 3 for 3. Pete Scott has a pair of homers into the new LF bleachers,
and Hornsby also homers to back Brandt.

At St. Louis, the Macks get a grand slam homer in the 1st from Sammy Hale
and homers in the 9th from Cochrane and Hauser. But the Browns answer
with a record tying three homers in the bottom of the 9th as Bettencourt,
Brannon and Blue connect. The five homers is a ML record that will be tied
in the 20th Century but never topped. The A's win, 10-8.

The Pirates trade OF Joe Harris and C Johnny Gooch to Brooklyn for C
Charlie Hargreaves.

The A's waive pitcher Ike Powers to Blomington (3I league) and send along
2B Bill Simmons, younger brother of Al Simmons, for a trial.

1929
Burleigh Grimes wins his 10th straight as the Pirates roll over the Dodgers,
9-2. Dazzy Vance gives up 5 runs - all unearned - in relief.

1930
The increased hitting in the NL is reflected in these current batting
averages:  Riggs Stephenson .420; Babe Herman .414; Chuck Klein .401; Harry
Heilmann .400; and Bill Terry .399. Giants' manager John McGraw observes,
"It's not the pitching, it's that new jack-rabbit ball. All a batter has
to do is meet it. If it's not hit right at somebody, it's a base hit."

The Giants whip the Cards today, 9-7, with a 5 run rally in the 7th. Mel
Ott has a pair of two-run homers to lead the win over Bill Hallahan. The
Cardinals, after winning 17 of 18, have now lost 12 of their last 13 and
are in 4th place with a 24-25 record.

1933
Welcome to the Bigs. A's reliever Bobby Coombs gives up a homer to his
first ML batter, but Jimmie Foxx homers in his first 3 at-bats, all off
Lefty Gomez, as the A's outscore the Yankees 14-10. Foxx had homered his
last time up the previous day to give him a ML-record-tying 4 consecutive
HRs. Bobby Lowe did it in 1894. Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth hit homers for New
York, with the Babe's landing across the street from the RF fence. Losing
pitcher Wilcey Moore gives up 6 runs in the 8th. Art Mahaffey is the winner.

The aptly named Homer Peel hits a grand slam to help the Giants to a 7-6
win over the Phillies.

1934
At Cincinnati, the Reds edge the Cubs, 4-3, behind the hitting of Babe
Herman. With a man on, he hits his 3rd homer in 4 days, and scores in the 6th
after hitting his 2nd double of the game. With the Midwest sweltering in a
heat wave, Larry MacPhail flies the Reds to Chicago on two American Airlines
cabin planes. One coach and 7 players elect to travel by rail. The Cubs will
travel by Pullman car and lose tomorrow to Tony Frietas and the Reds, 5-2.

1935
In the lidlifter in Boston, Lou Gehrig is 3 for 3 with 4 RBIs to lead New
York to a 13-6 win. Gehrig collides with Carl Reynolds on a play at 1B and
leaves the game with arm and shoulder injuries. He does play in game 2,
a 4-2 Boston win. Lefty Gomez walks 8 and wild-pitches home 2 runs to help
lose his 7th.

1936
Behind Larry French, the Cubs win 3-0 at Wrigley Field over the
Phillies. During the game, Cubs trainer Andy Lotshaw rushes from the dugout
to aid a woman hit by a foul ball only to discover that the injured woman
is his wife. She is not badly hurt (as noted by John Snyder).

1937
The White Sox take first place from the Yankees, beating New York 5-4 for
their 10th straight win. They'll lose their next outing, 10-3, on the 10th.

Bob Johnson's 4th inning double is the only hit against Eldon Auker as
Detroit beats the A's, 6-0. Hank Greenberg is 3 for 4 with a HR and Pete
Fox adds a round tripper.

1938
New York regains the lead with a double-win over the Cubs at Wrigley Field,
winning 4-2 in 10 innings, then taking the nightcap, 4-1. Harry Gumbert
beats Larry French in the first game while Carl Hubbell is the victor in
game 2, beating Bryant. French will lose 19 games for the Cubs, one shy of
the league leader in the category.

1939
At Shibe Park, the Yankees, using the long ball, rout the hometown A's
22-3. The Bronx Bombers set a franchise record hitting eight homeruns during
the contest, a mark which will not be tied for 68 years.

DiMaggio leads New York to a 7-2 win over the White Sox by hitting a single,
double and his 2nd homer of the year. Joe is now hitting .464. Lefty Edgar
Smith takes the loss for Chicago while rookie Atley Donald wins his 6th
without a loss. New York's record against southpaws is 15-4.

1940
At Cincinnati, reliever Carl Doyle of the Dodgers gives up 16 hits and 14 runs
in just 4 innings, as the Reds pound out 27 hits in a 23-2 win, regaining
1st place. Cincy is paced by Harry Craft, who hits for the cycle and adds
a single, and scores 4 runs. Teammate Frank McCormick scores 5 runs. Doyle
also manages to throw 2 wild pitches and hit 4 Cincinnati batters in the
game to help set a bitter tone to the Cincinnati-Dodgers rivalry, which will
continue through the decade. Doyle, however, won't be around as Brooklyn
ships him to the Cards in four days. His 4 hit batsmen ties a NL record.

1941
Yankee C Bill Dickey pulls off the only unassisted DP of his career in the
first of two with the Browns. Dickey catches Bob Swift's pop foul along the
first base line and tags first to double off the straying runner, Johnny
Berardino. The Yanks sweep the Browns, 9-3 and 8-3. DiMaggio collects 7 RBIs
on the afternoon, with 2 homers in the opener and 2 hits in the nitecap. He
has now hit in 24 straight. From today's 2nd game to July 26th, Joe will
jolt 11 homers without striking out.

At Chicago, Red Sox veteran Lefty Grove (4-1) goes 10 innings topping the
Pale Hose, 4-1. It is Lefty's 297th win.

1942
Despite 2 homers by Jeff Heath and 5 hits by Ken Keltner, the Indians lose
11-10 to the Yankees in 11 innings. Tom Ferrick's wild throw to 3B allows
DiMaggio to score the winning run. Joe Gordon singles in the 10th to extend
his hitting streak to 25 games, and Buddy Hassett's 2 singles extends his
hit streak to 20 games.

1944
Red Barrett retires the first 22 batters he faces before his bid for a
perfect game is broken up with an eighth inning single by Delmar Ennis. The
Cardinals' right-hander gains his first victory of the season with his 7-0
whitewashing of Philadelphia at Sportsman's Park.

Bucky Walters of the Reds outduels Max Lanier of the Cardinals, 2-1. The
Cardinal run, scored in the 9th, is the first they have scored off the Reds
righty in 45 innings.

At Pittsburgh, three runs score for the Cubs on one wild pitch by Pirates
rookie Art "Cookie" Cuccurullo, as the Cubs win, 10-6. Hy Vandenberg wins
over Preacher Roe.

Helped by an unassisted DP by CF George Case, the Senators tip the A's,
7-5. Case adds 3 stolen bases. The loss drops the A's into last place,
though they are just 4 1/2 games out of first.

The Cubs trade reserve infielder Eddie Stanky to the Dodgers for P Bob
Chipman.

1946
After acquiring Vince DiMaggio from the Phils in May, the Giants sell him
to the San Francisco Seals (PCL).

Cardinals P Red Barrett picks up his 1st win of the season, a 7-0 one-hitter
over the Phils. Barrett retires 22 straight before Del Ennis' 8th inning
single breaks up his no-hitter.

The Red Sox bag the Tigers, 15-4, behind Joe Dobson.

1947
On Luke Appling Day at Comiskey Park, the Senators take the lidlifter of
two edging the White Sox 1-0 in 18 innings on Al Evans' triple and Sherry
Robertson's long fly. It is the 4th 1-0 18-inning game in history. Frank
Papish tosses 13 scoreless innings for the Sox, giving him 27 straight
scoreless frames.

1948
In a game that Ted Williams later recalls as one of the most important of
the year, the visiting Indians trip the Red Sox, 2-0, behind Gene Bearden's
6th win. Lou Boudreau's controversial 2-run homer in the 4th inning off
Mel Parnell is all the scoring. The seemingly foul ball drops into the RF
corner stands and is called fair by 1st-base umpire Charley Berry. The Sox
are now 11 games behind.

1949
New York knuckler Tommy Byrne walks 13 Tigers in 11 innings, a Yankee club
record and the most passes handed out since 1935. Dick Weik will match it
in September and, as a Brown, Byrne will actually top it in an extra-inning
game in 1951. The 2nd-place Tigers manage just 4 hits, but finally score
with 2 out in the 11th to win, 3-2. Virgil Trucks gives up 3 hits in the
win. The Yankees' pitching staff will surrender 812 bases on balls this
year, the second-most of any team in ML history (the most ever was 827 by
the 1915 Philadelphia A's).

1950
After beating the Browns 20-4 with 23 hits yesterday at Fenway Park, today is
the most lopsided score in the 20th century, as the Boston Red Sox annihilate
the St. Louis Browns at Fenway Park, 29-4. Bobby Doerr has 3 HRs and 8 RBI;
Walt Dropo, 2 HRs, 7 RBI and 5 runs scored; and Ted Williams, 2 HRs and
5 RBI, all collecting a round tripper in the 8th inning. Pitcher Chuck
Stobbs walks 4 times in 4 innings. Al Zarilla adds 4 doubles, including 2
in one inning, and a single - with no ribbies - as the Sox set a ML record
with 58 total bases. Another mark is set of most extra bases on long hits
(32) in a game, and the most extra bases on long hits in consecutive games
(51). The Red Sox have 28 hits, with 4 players collecting 4 hits apiece
(tying the AL mark last done by Chicago in 1936) to total a record 51 for
2 days against the woeful Browns. The infield collects 16 hits to set an AL
mark. Leadoff batter Clyde Vollmer goes to the plate 8 times in 8 innings,
the only time this has happened in history. Boston has now scored 104 runs
in their last 7 games and a record 49 in 2 straight games.

The Yankees score 7 runs in the 6th to beat the Tigers, 11-4. Phil Rizzuto's
record string of 238 errorless chances ends when he fumbles a grounder in
the 5th.

1951
The Indians repeat history when they stop Dom DiMaggio's 27-game hitting
streak, just as they ended his brother Joe's record 56-game streak 10 years
before. The Tribe wins, 7-1, behind Bob Feller.

Before 53,940 at Comiskey Park, Vic Raschi and the Yankees edge the Sox,
4-2. Mantle, leading the Yankees with 33 RBIs, ties the game with a single and
throws out Nellie Fox, who tries to score from 3B on Minoso's fly to right.

1952
At Yankee Stadium, Browns P Tommy Byrne hits a 4th inning fly ball behind 3B
that New York's Gil McDougald chases. A fan catches the ball but the umpire
rules interference and calls the batter out. Browns manager Rogers Hornsby,
coaching third, doesn't disagree. However, Browns owner Bill Veeck, listening
on the radio in St. Louis, phones Hornsby and orders him to protest, which
Hornsby reluctantly does, but too late anyway. The Yanks win 5-2, then take
the nitecap as Vic Raschi shuts out St. Louis. That night, Hornsby calls
Veeck and tells him to stop meddling, a call that will cost him his job.

1955
After only eight games and 13 innings of work, the Dodgers option rookie
left-handed pitcher Tom Lasorda to Montreal to make room for a bonus baby
who is also a southpaw. Sandy Koufax, who had injured his ankle, comes off
the 30-day disabled list.

1958
Moe Drabowsky of the Cubs beats the Pirates 4-0. Ted Kluszewski's broken
bat single in the 2nd inning is the only Pittsburgh hit.

1960
Bob Turley tosses a 3-hit shutout against the White Sox, and Mantle adds his
9th and 10th homers of the season. His 2nd homer, in the 8th, is followed
by Maris' 16th of the year, matching his season total last year with KC. It
is the first time the M Boys have hit back-to-back homers.

1961
Milwaukee sets a ML record with 4 consecutive HRs in the 7th inning against
the Reds. Eddie Mathews and Hank Aaron hit back-to-back HRs off Jim Maloney;
Joe Adcock greets reliever Marshall Bridges with another HR, and Frank
Thomas sets the record. When these four teammates end their ML careers,
they will have hit a combined total of 1,889 homers. Mathews hits a second
blast, and Warren Spahn homers. For all the bombardment, the Braves lose 10-8.

The Kansas City Athletics hit 3 consecutive triples in a 5-run 3rd inning
while trimming the Yankees, 9-6, after a first-game loss, 6-1. Skowron
has a homer in the opener, the 17th straight game the Yanks have homered,
for a total of 32. The Bombers are shut out in the nitecap by Archer.

1962
The Cardinals' Bob Gibson tops the Giants 8-4, dropping San Francisco to
2nd place in the NL.

1963
In Philadelphia, Jim O'Toole gives the Reds their 2nd 1-0 victory in a week
when he beats the Phils today.

Baltimore P Chuck Estrada is finished for the season, with bone chips and
a spur in his right elbow.

1965
In the inaugural free-agent draft of high school, college and sandlot players,
the A's select Arizona star Rick Monday making him the first player ever to
be drafted. Picking second, the Mets select southpaw Les Rohr, who due to an
arm injury compiles only a 2-3 career mark pitching for the team in parts of
three seasons. Joe Coleman Jr is taken 3rd by the Senators. Cincinnati picks
Johnny Bench in the 2nd round after taking Bernie Carbo in the 1st. Later
in the day, New York makes a better choice selecting future Hall of Famer
Nolan Ryan in the eighth round.

Joe Torre, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron and Gene Oliver hit 10th-inning HRs,
as the Braves win 8-2 at Chicago. It sets the ML record for most HRs in an
extra inning.

1966
Bob Saverine of the Senators sets an AL record by coming to bat 12 times
in a doubleheader (more than 18 innings) without a hit. One or two couldn't
hurt as Baltimore wins 6-5 and 7-8.

1967
Gary Bell wins his Red Sox debut, 7-3, to give Boston a doubleheader split
with the White Sox. Yastrzemski has 6 hits for the day. Yaz, of whom Chicago
manager Eddie Stanky said two days earlier, "he may be an All-Star, I suppose,
but only from the neck down," hit his 12th HR. As he rounded the bases,
Yaz tipped his cap to Stanky.

1968
The Mets game at San Francisco is postponed at the demand of New
York players in the aftermath of New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy's
assassination. Commissioner William Eckert orders all games delayed until
evening. He also orders games at New York and Washington postponed.

Dodger right-hander Don Drysdale works 4 scoreless innings against
Philadelphia before finally allowing a run, after 58 2/3 shutout innings,
on Howie Bedell's sacrifice fly driving in Tony Taylor. Bedell has no other
RBIs in 1968. Drysdale breaks the ML record of 56 consecutive scoreless
innings set by Walter Johnson in 1913. The Dodgers win 5-3.

1969
On Mickey Mantle Day, the Yankees retire uniform number 7 in front of a
crowd of 60,096 at the ballpark in the Bronx. The Mick also receives a
plaque from Joe DiMaggio that will be hung in center field, and, then in
turn, he gives the 'Yankee Clipper' a similar plaque, telling the crowd,
"His should be just a little bit higher than mine." DiMaggio's plaque comes
as a surprise to Joe. The Yankees then sweep the White Sox 3-1 and 11-2.

The Expos snap a 20-game losing streak as Jerry Robertson wins his first
ML game, 4-3, at Los Angeles. Staub and Jones homer for the Expos who end
their losing streak 3 short of the record.

The White Sox trade P Bob Locker to the Pilots for P Gary Bell. Bell has
rung up his best games, and he will prove a disaster in Chicago.

1970
Players and management end their labor dispute by agreeing to a new standard
player contract. Among the players' victories is a raise in the minimum
salary from $10,000 to $12,000 per year.

1971
At Municipal Stadium, Paul Splittorff earns his first major league victory
when Kansas City defeats the visiting Senators, 4-2. In 1969, the 23-year-old
left-hander became the first player signed by the Royals to appear on the
expansion team's major-league roster.

Danny Goodwin is chosen as the first player in the June draft and turns down
a reported $50,000 offer from the White Sox to attend Southern University. He
will be chosen number one again in 1975. The Sox fail to sign 10 of their
14 picks. The Padres select P Jay Franklin with the 2nd pick. The Expos use
the 4th overall pick to take 17-year-old SS Condredge Holloway, who never
does play pro baseball, opting after college to play 13 seasons in the
CFL. Boston uses the 15th pick in the first round to take Jim Rice. Future
MVP Keith Hernandez, who did not play baseball his senior year in HS, lasts
until the 42nd round (Cards). The Senators pick Dartmouth's Pete Broberg and
he bypasses the minors to make his ML debut on June 20th. Other selections
to jump right to the majors are the U of Texas Burt Hooton (Cubs, June 17)
and MSU's Rob Ellis (Brewers, June 18).

Ken Holtzman pitches 12 innings for the Cubs before Joe Pepitone hits a
game-ending homer off Pittsburgh's Mudcat Grant to win, 1-0. Pepi did it
once before, in the AL, and is the first to do it in both leagues.

1972
Every Expo scores, including Ron Hunt with 5 runs, as Montreal beats San
Francisco 17-3.

1975
Detroit's Tom Veryzer doubles with two out in the 9th to stop Oakland's Ken
Holtzman's no-hitter. Outfielder Bill North misjudges Veryzer's hit, but is

The Brewers' catcher Darrell Porter drives in all 4 runs as Milwaukee tops
the Angels, 4-3. Jim Colborn wins his first of the year.

Montreal P Dave McNally, 3-6, announces his retirement.

1976
The Houston Astros, picking first in the baseball draft, select Arizona
State P Floyd Bannister, TSN's College Player of the Year. Bannister is
one of 12 eventual major leaguers from the ASU team, which finished 3rd
in the College World Series. The Tigers take P Pat Underwood with the 2nd
pick. OF Rickey Henderson lasts until the 4th round.

The Tigers send veteran Joe Coleman, 10-18 in 1975, to the Cubs for cash
and a player to be named later.

1977
Nolan Ryan notches his 4th career 19-strikeout game, hurling the first
10 innings of a game against Toronto (which the Angels eventually win,
2-1). Ryan has struck out 11 or more in five straight games, and will
notch 10 and 14 in his next two starts, a record of 10+ strikeouts in

free-agent draft by the Braves. Horner will skip the minors and debut on
June 16 with a homer in his first game, off Blyleven. The Blue Jays make
Lloyd Moseby the 2nd selection. The Yankees, with 3 first-round selections
awarded as compensation in player signings, pick Rex Hudler, Matt Winters
and Brian Ryder. In the 23rd round they take a Clearwater RHP named Howard
Johnson, who will make the ML as an infielder. MSU's Kirk Gibson, who most
teams assume will play football, lasts until the 12th overall pick when
his hometown Tigers take him. He signs for $200,000 and promises to drop
football. Kent Hrbek lasts until the 17th round, and on the 20th round
the Phillies gamble on prep all-American QB Ryne Sandberg. Besides Horner,
3 other draft picks, all high schoolers, will jump directly to the majors

first round pick to take Stanford QB John Elway while the Ranger pick Yale's
Ron Darling with #9. Darling is the 4th Ivy Leaguer to be picked in the 1st
round. The Braves fare the worst in the draft as their #1 pick Jay Roberts
will never hit above .208 in the minors, and no other picks make it to the
Bigs. The Reds select high school catcher Lanell Cuver as their top pick,
but do better in the 4th round, picking Paul O'Neill.
