After Cincy loses 8-0 in the opener of a twinbill, the Reds' Bill Phillips
sets several records in game two as he gives up 19 runs and 22 hits at
Philadelphia, losing, 19-1. In 8 innings he faces a record 55 batters,
with 49 official at-bats - both NL records for the 20th century. Phils
pitcher Doc White has 4 hits, including an inside-the-park homer.

The Chicago Cubs lose, 2-1, to Brooklyn when Bill Dahlen hits a sac fly to

Legs Hickman in the bottom of the 9th. Christy Mathewson allows 6 hits in
beating Willie Sudhoff, though the Cards' pitcher hits a two-run homer,
his only major league round tripper.

Turkey Mike Donlin is 6 for 6 with 2 singles, 2 doubles and 2 triples, and
scores 5 runs as Baltimore trounces Detroit, 17-8. The other 2 outfielders
total 6 hits to set an AL record of 12 two weeks after the NL mark for hits
by an outfield is set. Roscoe Miller toils the whole game for Detroit.

At Philadelphia, the A's and White Sox battle for 14 innings before Chicago
pushes across 3 runs to finally win, 7-5. Callahan and Fraser are the
starters and finishers for the two teams. Socks Seybold has a triple and
HR for the A's.

1905
Chicago Zephyrs rookie righthander Ed Reulbach wins an 18-inning marathon
duel with the Cards' Jack Taylor, 2-1, in St. Louis. First baseman Frank
Chance has 27 putouts and 2 assists for Chicago. Three years ago, Taylor
went 19 innings against Pittsburgh.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants beat Boston, 2-1, in 12 innings, with
Mathewson getting the win. With 2 outs in the 12th, Matty hits a flyball
to CF Rip Cannell, who drops the ball. Catcher Frank Bowerman, on 1B,
chugs around with the winning run. Irv Young is the unfortunate loser.

1906
At Chicago, with one on and the Tigers down 2-1 with two outs in the 9th,
pinch hitter Germany Schaefer calls his homerun shot (according to Davy Jones
in Glory of Their Times). He announces to the crowd: "Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now looking at Herman Schaefer, better known as 'Herman the Great,'
acknowledged by one and all to be the greatest pinch hitter in the world. I am
now going to hit the ball into the left-field bleachers. Thank you." Facing
White Sox starter Doc White, Germany then hits the first pitch into the LF
bleachers for a game-winning homer. He supposedly slides into every base,
announcing his progress along the way. At second base it is "Schaefer
leads at the half." After sliding into home, he jumps up and calls out,
"Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this afternoon's performance. I thank
you for your kind attention." Newspaper accounts confirm the bare facts
but not all of Jones' story. The loss drops the White Sox back into 5th place.

1907
In the Tri-State League at Williamsport, a game with Altoona ends in the 4th
inning when a bolt of lightning sets fire to the grandstand. Williamsport
pitcher Vickers is so stunned by the ordeal that he needs medical attention.

replaces him following today's 6-6 tie with the A's. New York fades fast
and will finish last with 103 losses.

At Detroit, the Browns' Rube Waddell refuses to heel and whips the Tigers,
7-1. Waddell, known as an animal lover, ignores the two dogs that the Tigers
have in the dugout and is not distracted when Tiger manager Hughey Jennings
brings one out to the third base coach's box.

breaking a 3-3 tie with an 8th-inning single. He ends his scoring with a
steal of home as the Pirates win, 5-3, over the Reds.

The Giants sweep 2 games from Boston to move into 3rd place. Hooks Wiltse

by unnoticed.

1917
Cincinnati splits a pair with the Cardinals, losing 4-2 before winning
15-4. The Reds' Fred Toney is caught stealing 3 times in the game, tying
a NL record. Cards catchers will do the same to Hy Myers in 2 months.

In Columbus, Ohio, the Yankees play an exhibition game against a semi-pro
team, winning 10-1. Babe Ruth hits 6 balls out in batting practice,
including one over the LF fence onto the brewery's roof. He grounds out,
walks, and homers far over the RF fence his third at-bat. He hits a Texas
Leaguer to short left on his next AB, but hustles it into a double. He walks
his last AB. Babe steals two bases, and pitches the bottom of the ninth,

innings in 1920 for NY, pitches 8 shutout innings.

In the Cubs' 6-1 victory over the Phillies at Wrigley Field, slugger Hack
Wilson fouls a pitch into the stands, where it is caught by 17-year-old
Arthur Porto. Porto is confronted by an usher who tells him the Cubs cannot
"afford to let the customers walk off with their baseballs" and demands the
return of the ball. Porto and two friends argue and are arrested by stadium
security and charged with disorderly conduct. In court the next day, the
judge issues a landmark decision, ruling that a ball hit into the stands
belongs "to the boy who grabs it." The charges are dismissed.

1931
Bill Sweeney, Red Sox 1B, makes 21 putouts, one fewer than Hal Chase's
1906 record, as Boston infielders record 25 putouts. Boston outfielders
have no putouts as the Red Sox win 7-3 in Cleveland. Berry drives in 5 runs
for Boston.

The Cards sweep a pair from the Phils, winning both games by 4-2 scores. After
allowing just 3 hits in 8 innings, Ray Benge loses the opener in the 9th,
the 2nd straight game he's lost to the Redbirds in the 9th. In the nitecap,

inning good for 5 ribbies and 8 total bases to lead the Yankees to an
18-11 win over the White Sox. Joe is the 5th batter to hit two homers in an
inning. His first is a two-run shot off Babe Phelps and the 2nd homer is a
3-run clout off Fred Lasher. For good measure, DiMag adds 2 doubles for a
ML record tying 4 long hits. New York scores 10 times in the 5th, 9 runs
scoring on homers. Jack Powell accounted for 4 runs in the inning with a
grand slam and Gehrig becomes the 1st MLer to collect 100 hits for the year.

1944
The Cardinals beat the Pirates, 16-0, as Cards hurler Mort Cooper tosses a

a $500 fine by manager Ott. Voiselle also made 2 consecutive starts last
season, on Septmber 2/3, winning the second game.

1946
A bus careens off a Cascade Mountain pass road, killing 9 members of the
Spokane (Western International League) club. Jack Lohrke, a young infielder,
had not reboarded the bus after it stopped at a restaurant just before the
accident. The restaurant owner called him as he was about to get on the bus,
telling him there was a long distance phone call and that he had been sold
to San Diego. He decided to return. He later exclaimed, "I guess it just
wasn't my turn. But how did the owner know we would stop in that town? And
what if the call had come five minutes later?" The future Giant and Phil
will be known ever after as Lucky.

In a 13-inning 6-5 loss to the Reds, Brooklyn's Pete Reiser grounds into
a double play ending a streak of 887 at-bats without hitting into one. The
record began on July 21, 1941, with three years off for the Service. Reiser's
mark will last more than a half-century until the Pirates' Tony Womack
breaks it on July 27, 1998.

1947
At Forbes Field, Jackie Robinson steals home in the 5th (Ostermuller pitching)

pitching.

to the the Minneapolis Millers, the Triple A affiliate of the parent club.

With just 11 career homers, catcher Wes Westrum has 3 HRs and a triple today,

silences the boos by crushing his first major league HR, off Billy Hoeft. The
Tigers coast to the win, 18-7. The 18-year-old rookie, who becomes known as
'Killer', will finish his 22-year Hall of Fame career with 573 homers.

1956
Ed Bailey of the Reds hits 3 HRs, and Kluszewski adds another, in a 10-6

by Bob Thurman, off young Don Drysdale and rookie Frank Robinson, off loser
Clem Labine.

The Braves get superb pitching from Lew Burdette and Gene Conley and take
2 from the Giants, 6-2 and 7-1. The first-place Braves have now won 10
straight and are 2 games ahead of the Reds. Burdette allows just 4 hits in
the opener, while Conley allows 4 hits in 7 innings in the nitecap. Reliever
Dave Jolly allows 3 more, including a Dusty Rhodes homer. In the first game,
Danny O'Connell's 3-run homer off Jim Hearn is the big blow. It is Danny's
2nd homer of the year and his 2nd in two days.

1958
The Yankees erupt for 5 runs in the 4th inning off Early Wynn to beat the
Sox 6-2 at Comiskey. Mantle's clout into the CF bleachers leads off the

by Siebern. Duren K's 6 of the last 9 batters to preserve Bob Turley's win.

1960
Stan Musial returns to the Cardinals' lineup after being benched at the

9-7 victory. Reed, a Mississippi native, replaced Pepitone in the 13th. For
the Tigers, Phil Regan takes the loss and Rocky Colavito has 7 hits. Bobby
Richardson ties a mark by going to the plate 11 times. At an even 7 hours,
the game is the longest extra-inning contest in league history and it is
the longest game in innings in Yankee history.

Led by a grand slam from Hank Foiles and 4 RBIs on 2 HRs from Frank Robinson,
the Reds outslug the Dodgers, 12-10, at Dodger Stadium.

chance when he strikes out in the 1st inning with the bases loaded. Denny
McLain is the victor. First baseman Willie Smith pitches the last 3 innings,
walking just one and allowing one hit and no runs. Detroit's Don Wert is
taken to the hospital following a 6th inning beaning which shatters his
batting helmet. He will miss just a few games.

1969
Richie Allen is fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely when he fails to
appear at Shea Stadium for the Phillies' twi-night doubleheader game with
the Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race
and got caught in traffic trying to return. He will stay suspended until
July 20. Allen picked up a $1000 fine in May when, for two straight days, he
reportedly arrived at the ballpark after the game had started. Without Allen,
the Phils drop a pair, 2-1 and 5-0. Larry Hisle's homer in the opener off
Tom Seaver is the only Phils score. McAndrew is the winner in the nitecap,
allowing 2 hits in 8 innings.

The White Sox sweep a pair from the Pilots, winning 6-4 and 7-6 with reliever
Wilbur Wood winning both games. In game 2, Bill Melton hits 3 consecutive
homers, in the 2nd, 4th and 6th innings, but it takes a homer by Herrmann
in the 9th to win it. Reliever Wilbur Wood is the winner in both games,
giving up a hit in 3 2/3 innings in game 1 and a hit in 2 innings of game
2. Jim Bouton pitches in both games for Seattle without allowing a run in
3 2/3 innings.

Ruehlman and is flown by helicopter to the Reds' new home, Riverfront Stadium.

In a doubleheader with the Indians at Yankee Stadium, Bobby Murcer ties Lou
Gehrig's club record of 4 straight homers. The Yanks lose the opener 7-2,
despite Murcer's 9th-inning HR off Sam McDowell. Murcer next connects off
game 2's starter Mike Paul, hitting a solo shot in the 1st inning. A walk
in the 4th, then a 2-run homer off Paul in the 5th, and a game-tying homer
in the 8th, off Fred Lasher. New York scores in the bottom of the 9th to
salvage a 5-4 win. Cleveland 1B Tony Horton hears a hoo and literally crawls
back to the dugout after fanning on two of Yankee hurler Steve Hamilton's
"Folly floaters." After fouling one off in the ninth-inning he asks the New
York hurler to throw him the pitch again. His second foul ball is caught
by backstop Thurman Munson. Sensitive to fans' booing during the season,
Horton will be hospitalized, and at 25, this is his last season.

on May 23rd.

1977
After hitting what appears to be a three-run homer in the third inning
at Metropolitan Stadium, Ralph Garr is called out for passing teammate Jim
Essian, who waited at first base to make sure the ball cleared the fence. The
White Sox outfielder is awarded a two-run single, but the mistake proves
costly when Chicago loses the game in Minnesota, 7-6.

Before 54,940 at Yankee Stadium, Roy White launches a dramatic 2-out 2-run
homerun in the bottom of the 9th to give the Yanks a 5-5 tie with the Red
Sox, and New York scores in the next inning on Reggie Jackson's bases-loaded
single to win, 6-5. White's key hit comes after Bill Campbell retires the
first 2 Yankees in the 9th and then Willie Randolph triples to bring up
Murcer. Sparky Lyle picks up the win, handing Boston their 1st loss in
8 games. With homers from Yaz, Hobson and George Scott, the Sox set a ML

and Fisk hits his 15th homer of the year.

1979
Rickey Henderson makes his ML debut for Oakland in a 5-1 loss to Texas in

mostly to welcome back popular OF Gorman Thomas, who was traded to Cleveland
earlier this month.

1984
Oakland's Joe Morgan hits his 265th career homerun as a 2B, breaking Rogers

into an inside-the-park homer when it bounces over the head of Harold Baines
to give the Twins a 3-2 win over the White Sox. Rich Dotson is the unlucky
loser. The Twins' Bush had an IPHR in yesterday's 4-3 win over Chicago.

At San Francisco, the Cardinals sweep a pair from the Giants, winning 4-3 and
5-1. This is the last regularly scheduled July 4th doubleheader this century.

1988

Bluefield Orioles to beat the hometown Burlington Indians, 3-2. The
Appalichian League contest, which ended at 3:27 in the morning, lasted
eight hours and 15 minutes.

In a tribute held at Shea Stadium, Tom Seaver (41) becomes the only Met
player to have his uniform number retired. In addition to managers Casey
Stengel (37) and Gil Hodges (14), the future Hall of Fame right-hander, who
compiled a 198-124 record (.615) during a dozen seasons with the Amazins,
becomes the third person to be honored by the franchise in this manner.

Cleveland's Doug Jones celebrates his 31st birthday by saving his 14th game

California's Dave Winfield goes 5 for 5 and hits for the cycle as the
Angels defeat Kansas City, 9-4. In so doing, he becomes the oldest player in
history (39) to accomplish the feat. He completes the cycle, the first of
his career, in the 8th with a triple off infielder Bill Pecota, making his
first pitching appearance. Winfield was the first batter faced by Pecota,
who took over when Tom Gordon's hemorrhoids acted up.

1992
Much to the protest of the Yankees brass, Fay Vincent permanently suspends
pitcher Steve Howe for repeated drug offenses after the left-handed reliever
is arrested for buying a gram of cocaine. It is Howe's 7th ban from the
game, as he becomes the 1st player ever permanently banned from baseball
because of drugs. In November, an arbitrator will overturn the lifetime
ban allowing the former Rookie of the Year to enjoy one of his best seasons
when he saves 15 games with a 1.80 ERA for the Bronx Bombers in 1994.

The Mets, behind Doc Gooden, defeat the Cubs, 3-2 at New York. Jackson takes
the loss. Gooden has now beaten the Cubs 12 straight times (according to
historian Ed Hartig). Before his loss in August of 1987, he had another
streak of 10 straight wins over the Cubs.

1993
The Mets tie an 86-year-old record when they lose to the Cardinals, 8-5. They
have not won 2 straight games for the 61st consecutive time.

After never having had a multi-homer game in his career, dating back to
Little League, Giants 2B Robby Thompson hits 2 HRs in a game for the 2nd
day in a row, leading SF to a 17-2 win over the Rockies. Thompson gets 5
hits on the day for the Giants.

Carlton Fisk of the White Sox, plays his 2,226 and final ML game, surpassing
Bob Boone's record of 2,225 for most games caught. Fisk reluctantly retires
with 3,999 total bases, the most ever for a catcher. The Sox will exacerbate
Fisk's bitterness by refusing to allow him into the locker room after the
Sox make the playoffs this year. When the Sox retire Fisk's #72 in 1997,
Fisk will request that Jerry Reinsdorf and GM Ron Schueler not be there for
the ceremony, and when he goes into Cooperstown he will wear a Red Sox cap. A
clerical error about 3 games caught in 1981 in which Fisk relieved initially
gives him a total of 2,229 games caught. This error will appear on Fisk's
Hall of Fame plaque when he is inducted, the 5th edition of Total Baseball,
and the 1997 edition of The Sports Encyclopedia-Baseball. Other record books
such as the final edition of The Baseball Encyclopedia, the 1997 editions of
The Sporting News Complete Baseball Record Book and the Elias Book of Baseball
Records both correctly showed him with 2,226 games caught lifetime. SABR
historian Wayne McElreavy and others note the discrepancy and the plaque
and subsequent editions of the record books have corrected the total to 2,226.

The Marlins obtain OF Gary Sheffield and P Rich Rodriguez from the Padres
for P Trevor Hoffman, Andres Berumen and Jose Martinez. The Fish will give
Sheffield a 4-year contract extension in September. Hoffman will save 552
games for the Padres during his fifteen and half years with the franchise.

of 7 innings when a curfew calls the game at 1:18 a.m. There are a total of
3 hours 10 minutes in rain delays counting the delay to start the game. The
game will be completed tomorrow with the Yankees winning 11-6 in a game that
takes 4 hours 3 minutes in total to play, a Cleveland team record. Not to
be outdone, the two teams play to a 12-11 Yankee win on the following day
in a game that takes exactly 4 hours 3 minutes to play. The two teams total
11 runs scored in the 8th.

1995
Phillies 2B Mickey Morandini strokes 5 hits to lead Philadelphia to a 10-9

in 4 as the Yankees top Detroit, 12-9. Chad Curtis adds 5 ribbies for NY.

At Seattle, the Mariners fall to the Athletics, 4-1, despite a 19-strikeout
performance by Randy Johnson. The 19 Ks are the most ever by an American

major league record). Mark McGwire turns one Johnson fastball into a homer
that travels an estimated 538 feet.

1998

After being outscored 20-2 in 2 losses to Florida, the Phils rebound with a
9-3 win. The Phils stay 2 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta with Florida another
game back. Bobby Abreu has 3 hits including an inside-the-park homer in
the 9th when Cliff Floyd crashes into the wall trying for the ball. Floyd,
who had an IPHR earlier this year, keeps his 18-game hit streak alive,
off winning pitcher Bruce Chen.

The Royals send C Sal Fasano and P Mac Suzuki to the Rockies for C Brent
Mayne.

2002
The Twins beat the White Sox, 5-4, by scoring the winning run in the last
of the eighth when Jacque Jones doubles home Luis Rivas. Jones is thrown
out at third trying for a triple. When he's called out, a security guard who

pitched. The Mets set a NL record by hitting 3 sacrifice flies (Castro,
Reyes, Cameron) in the 3-run 2nd inning. One of the balls is dropped by
Bernie Williams for an error. The last team to have three sac flies in an
inning was the White Sox who did it against Cleveland in the 1st game of
a doubleheader on July 1, 1962. The Mets tie another NL mark with 4 sac
flies in the game. The 2nd inning goes like this:  backstop Ramon Castro's
sac fly to right ties the game at 1-1 as David Wright advances to third;

balls and strikes.

2011
In New York's 4-2 loss to Colorado, A.J. Burnett becomes the first Yankee
hurler to strike out four hitters in one inning. The right-hander starts the

for a third strike, he faces Todd Helton and strikes him out swinging to
end the inning.

Michael Kacer, a 29-year-old veteran, who lost his arm during a rocket

ball at Yankee Stadium. The event attracts national attention when the
video of the catch becomes viral on the web, and with ESPN including it in
its top plays segment on SportsCenter.

The Nationals name bench coach John McLaren as the interim manager to
replace the departed Jim Riggleman, who surprised the team by quitting
yesterday. Washington GM Mike Rizzo indicates the appointment is just for
a few games, and will name Davey Johnson as the long-term replacement in
the next few days.

For the second time in two years a club plays as a road team in their own
ballpark when the Marlins' three-game series with the Mariners is shifted to
Safeco Field due to preparations at Sun Life Stadium for a U2 concert to be
held in Miami. Last season, MLB moved the Blue Jays' home series against the
Phillies, scheduled to be played at Rogers Centre, due to security concerns
raised because of protests at the G20 Summit that was being held near the
Toronto stadium.

2013
At Tropicana Field, the Rays halt the Blue Jays' 11-game winning streak,
4-3, thanks to back-to-back-to-back homeruns in the second inning by James

catcher's clout comes in the ninth inning of the team's 7-3 loss to Chicago
at Wrigley Field.

2016
The Lexington Legends, a Class A affiliate of the Royals, are giving away
a Glenn Hubbard bobble head, depicting him with a snake draped around his

holding a real, eight-foot boa constrictor.

2017
Oakland Athletics rookies Matt Olson, Jaycob Brugman, and Franklin Barreto
