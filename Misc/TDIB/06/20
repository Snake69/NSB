Chesbro blanks the Giants, 7-0.

1904
New York coasts to a 12-4 win over Brooklyn, pounding out 13 hits to beat
Bill Reidy. Mathewson picks up his 11th win. Reidy's cause is not helped
by 9 Brooklyn errors, including 5 by ex-Giant SS Charlie Babb.

hits for the cycle. Boston wins, 9-0, after losing 6-3.

her. Judge M. Laughlin rules that patrons attend baseball games at their
own risk.

1906
At Exposition Park, Honus Wagner clubs one of the longest hits in park
history, but only makes it to 3B. Rounding first he is clipped by 1B Kid
Gleason, and Wagner limps his way to a triple. A courtesy pinch runner,
Harry Smith, scores for the Pirates on a fly. The Giants generously allow
Wagner to return to SS in the game, a 15-2 win for Pittsburgh, but the
injury will force him to miss 3 games.

Cleveland's Willie Mitchell. It's Cobb's 30th straight game. He adds 2
stolen bases to help Detroit win, 8-3.

a ML record 21 putouts.

Pete Alexander pitches 3 2/3 innings in relief to earn the win in a 6-5

1912
With no hint that a record is about to be set, the Giants coast to a 14-2
lead through 8 innings at Boston, then score 7 more in the 9th for a 21-2
lead. The Braves rally for 10 in the last of the 9th, but lose 21-12. The
17 runs are the NL post-1900 record scored by 2 teams in the 9th. Another
20th century mark set is the 11 stolen bases by the Giants - four by Josh
Devore, including two in the 9th - and 14 swipes by both clubs. Thirteen
Giants score runs, tying the ML record. The Giants' Ernie Shore makes his
ML debut in this game and surrenders 8 hits, a walk and 10 runs (3 earned)
in one inning, the 9th, of relief work, but is credited with a save for Hooks
Wiltse. It is his only appearance in the NL. Buster Brown takes the loss.

In a doubleheader split at Cincinnati, Pittsburgh's Owen Wilson hits two
triples in the opener, including one in the 10th with a man on to win,
6-4. He then hits another in the nitecap, a 5-3 loss. It's his 5th straight
game with a three-bagger. Wilson will hit an incredible 36 triples this
season, a major league record.

From the Traverse City Record-Eagle:  There is one thing that owners of
automobiles, attending the games will have to be careful of, and that is
running across the outfield while games are in progress. It not only cuts up
the field, but should a ball be hit into the outfield when a car is going
across the field ten or fifteen miles per hour, there is a great danger of
players running into it. There is a good half mile track around the field,
that is just right for those who wish to get on the east side of the grounds.

1913
After New York wins the opener, 9-3, Washington starter Bert Gallia hits 3
of the first 4 batters he faces in the first inning of the nitecap. Three
more New York batters are plunked, by relievers Joe Engel (2) and Tom Hughes
(1), for a record six. The outcome is the same as New York wins again,
9-3. New York leadoff hitter Bert Daniels puts his name in the record book
when he gets hit 3 times.

1915
In a 13-inning 4-3 win over the Phillies, Honus Wagner cracks his 100th ML
homer. He is the first to reach that number. Wagner, who hit his first homer
in 1897 for Louisville, now has 3131 hits, according to the Boston Globe.

Pittsburgh and Newark (FL) trade shutouts. Newark's Clint Rogge throws a
one-hitter to win, 2-0, and then the Pittfeds win, 3-0.

1916
Tilly Walker's HR over the LF wall is the only HR the Red Sox will hit at
Fenway this season, but it is the lone Boston score today as the Yankees
win, 4-1. Inserted as a defensive replacement late in the game, Boston SS
Everett Scott starts a string of 1,307 consecutive games, all played at
SS. He will complete the streak as a Yankee on May 6, 1925. It will be the
best until Gehrig's 2,130.

1918
In Chicago, the White Sox play the Indians with the receipts going to build
a recreation house for the benefit of soldiers and sailors. A baseball
autographed by evanglist Billy Sunday, a former center fielder for the
Chicago White Stockings, sells for $50. An autographed ball signed by
President Wilson goes for $5,650 while one signed by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson
goes for $1,450. The Sox push across a run in the 10th to win, 5-4.

The Red Sox and A's trade shutouts, with Boston losing the opener, 2-0 before
winning, 3-0. Tilly Walker does the most damamge, hitting a 2-run HR in
game one that lands on Landsdowne Avenue. It is the 4th time he has homered
over the LF wall at Fenway, having hit one off Keating, Gregg and Leonard
previously. Walker also knocks Dutch Leonard out of the second game when he
hits a line drive off the pitcher's hand in the 6th. Vince Molyneaux finishes
up for his only career win, while Scott Perry absorbs his 7th straight loss.

Dutch Leonard will jump the Sox to take a job at the Fore River Ship
Yard in Quincy, Massachusetts and pitch for the team there. The move will
interrupt Leonard's streak of reaching double figures in wins every year,
but prompt the Sox to trade him at the end of the year. Big Jeff Tesreau
says he has jumped the Giants to take a job with a steel company and pitch
in the Steel league. He knows his days are numbered and he wants to learn
the steel business.

1921
At Fenway Park, Babe Ruth hits his 127th homerun helping the Yankees defeat

the cycle.

1926
A delegation of Coffeyville, Kansas fans comes to St. Louis to see their
hometown hero, Walter Johnson, pitch against the Browns. Unfortunately, the

big blow for the Browns is a 3-run pinch HR in the 7th by Ken Williams.

1929
The Giants top the Phils, 11-6, as Mel Ott knocks in 3 runs, the 11th
straight game that Memphis Bill has tallied a RBI. He's driven in 27 runs
in the streak.

will rejoin the team in New York in mid-July.

1930
Dazzy Vance loses a tough one to the Reds, 2-1, when two runners reach on
errors before George Kelly drives them home with a double.

1931
At Chicago, Rube Walberg pitches the first-place A's to a 5-4 win over the
White Sox. Luke Appling, pinch hitting in the 9th, hits his first ML HR
off Walberg.

1932
Doc Cramer of the A's has 6 hits in consecutive at-bats as Philadelphia
outslugs the White Sox, 18-11. Cramer will do this again in 1935, the only
AL player to repeat the feat. Mule Haas adds a grand slam for the A's,
while Jimmie Foxx slugs a 3-run homer over the high wall in left center,
one of longest homers ever at Comiskey Park. Mickey Cochrane has 4 RBIs on
4 hits as the A's bang out 26 safeties.

Danny Taylor, centerfielder for Brooklyn makes an unassisted DP but it is
little help as the Cardinals win, 15-4.

Ott leads the way with two homers - his 16th and 17th - and drives in 6
runs. Joe Moore has 4 hits including a homer and Fred Fitzsimmons, who
weakened in the 8th, is credited with the win. Charlie Root, who got none
out in the 3rd before retiring, is the loser. The Giants now lead the Cards
by five games.

At St. Louis, the Dodgers use 15 hits to down the Cards, 9-5. Danny Taylor,
with three extra base hits, and Tony Cuccinello, with a 3-run homer,
pace the offense. Van Lingle Mungo wins his 11th of the year, allowing,
coincidentally, 11 hits. Pepper Martin has two hits and steals home.

The AL leading New York Yankees trip the Indians twice, 3-2 and 3-0, at
Yankee Stadium. New York ties the first game on Frank Crosetti's solo homer
in the 8th against Bob Weiland, then wins it on Lou Gehrig's 18th homer in
the 9th. Lefty Gomez, in relief of Johnny Broaca, is the winner. In game 2,
Hal Trosky's single is the only hit off Yankee righthander Red Ruffing,
who also knocks in a run.

The Browns rout the A's, 11-3, behind 5 RBIs by Rollie Hemsley. Hemsley
is knocked out in a collision in the 4th inning, but stays in to triple
with the sacks full in the 7th. Bob Johnson, leading the majors in homers,
hits his 20th in the 9th inning. Connie Mack misses the game to be best
man for his son Connie, who is married in Washington to Susan Sheppard,
daughter of Senator Sheppard. The two met at Duke University, where the
bride was named Queen of Beauty.

The Tigers score 3 in the 11th to defeat the Senators, 13-10. The Tigers
get three-hit performances apiece from Marv Owen, Mickey Cochrane, Charlie
Gehringer and Hank Greenberg, who also homers. Washington's Heinie Manush,
the AL batting average leader, has 4 hits and two homers as the Senators
collect 17 hits. Manush now has 102 hits in 60 games ... no other player
in the rest of the century will reach the 100-hit mark as quickly. In 2000,
Darin Erstad will collect his 100th in his 61st game.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1936
At Brooklyn, the Cubs' Ken O'Dea breaks a 4-4 tie with a 9th inning pinch
single and Chicago wins, 6-4, extending its winning streak to 14 games. The
lowly Dodgers knock starter Bill Lee out in the 2nd, but relievers Larry
French and Charley Root are effective in holding the hosts in check.

In Chicago, Bob Johnson's 9th homer of the year breaks up a pitching duel
between Harry Kelley and Sugar Cain, as the A's win over the Sox, 2-1. Each
pitcher allows four hits.

At Detroit, Tommy Bridges gives up 5 hits and strikes out 11 in shutting out
the Yankees, 5-0. The Tiger ace stops Lou Gehrig's hitting streak at 18 games.

1937
The Yankees draw a crowd of 68,939 and sweep a pair from the White Sox,
8-4 and 7-4. Lefty Gomez tops Ted Lyons in the opener, with George Selkirk
providing 2 homers. Monte Pearson is the winner in game 2.

1940
The Yankees lose to the White Sox 1-0 in 11 innings, their 6th straight
loss, then protest a "catch" by Sox LF Moose Solters, contending he dropped
the ball in the 2nd inning when he was reaching for his cap. Umpire George
Quinn apparently missed the error and the protest is upheld. The game will
be replayed September 18 but, for several years, all of today's records,
including Monte Pearson's loss and Johnny Rigney's win, will count. It is the
first time since 1919 that the Yankees have been shut out in extra innings
by one pitcher. They lost on May 19, 1935 in extra innings to 2 pitchers,
Stewart and Brown.

Boston loses a pair - and the 4 game series - to the Browns, 2-1 and 11-4,
and drops out of first place. The Indians take over 1st with a 12-1 drubbing
of the Senators. The new issue of The Sporting News headlines "'I'll be
Nice if I Can,' says Vitt of Tribe Truce."

1942
Cleveland's Al Smith allows just one Yankee hit - a second inning double by
Joe DiMaggio - in beating New York, 1-0. Ernie Bonham takes the loss. The
New Yorkers have lost 5 of their last six games - two by 1-0 scores -
but still lead the AL by 9 1/2 games.

The Dodgers stop the Cardinals, 9-4, pounding out fifteen hits. Joe Medwick,
the NL's leading hitter (.350) has four hits to stretch his consecutive hit
streak to 23 games. Hugh Casey, who came on in the 3rd and allows just two
hits, is the winner.

At Bolden's Bowl, Josh Gibson leads the Homestead Grays (Negro League)
to a 7-2 win over the host Philadelphia Stars. Gibson clouts his second
homer in two games.

1943
In St. Louis, the Cubs and Cards split a pair. Max Lanier is the victor in
the 10-9 opener, with a little help from Cubs 2B Eddie Stanky, who makes 3
errors in the 8th inning. The 3 Es ties the NL mark. Hi Bithorn gives the
Cubs a 2-1 win in game 2.

1946
The Cards remain a game and a half behind the Dodgers by beating the Braves,
9-1. The Birds break up a pitching duel between Dickson and Wright by
scoring 8 runs in the 8th inning. Musial has a pair of doubles in the big

A Fortune magazine story gives some rare details of baseball finances,
showing the 1945 Yankees revenue of $1.6 million and profit of $306,000,
cut to $201,000 after minor league losses. Of the gross income, $896,000
is from home ticket sales.

1947
Yale bests Clemson 7-3 in the first game of the NCAA East Regional. Eli 1B
George Bush has a single in 4 at-bats and steals a base. Winning pitcher Frank
Quinn will sign a $50,000 bonus with the Red Sox but never win a ML game. Yale
will lose, 8-7, to the University of California in the College World Series.

The Browns sell P Denny Galehouse to the Red Sox, the team that traded him
to St. Louis in 1938. Galehouse, 1-3 with the Browns this year, will go
11-7 with the Sox.

1948
Joe DiMaggio smashes three homers to lead the Yanks to a 4-2 and 6-2 sweep
of the Browns. Vic Raschi wins his 8th in a row in the opener, besting Fred
Sanford. DiMag's two homers in the nitecap, a solo shot in the 8th and a
3-run homer in the 9th, give Red Embree the win. The double victory puts
the Yanks in 2nd place 3 1/2 games behind Cleveland.

Cleveland draws 82,781 for a doubleheader win over the A's, a ML record for
a regular season game that will be broken by the same club in 1954. The
Indians will attract 2.6 million for the season, surpassing the Yankees'
1947 attendance. The two losses, 4-3 to Feller (6-7) and 10-0 to Lemon
(10-5), drop the faltering A's into 3rd place.

After being shut out, 9-0, by the Phillies' Dutch Leonard, the Pirates
come back to win the nitecap, 7-5, behind Ralph Kiner's 18th and 19th
homers. Kiner will hit HRs every Sunday for 8 successive weeks in May and
June. For the year he will hit 17 round trippers in 38 Sunday games. The
Phils are paced in the opener by Miller who drives in 5 runs on 3 singles,
and Ashburn who makes 4 hits, then adds 3 more in the nitecap.

Luke Appling, in the his first game at 3B, breaks a 47-year-old AL record
by making 10 assists in an 8-5 Sox win over Washington. Before the game,

complained that his arm was stiff and he couldn't possibly throw from
third. Appling also makes 3 hits. Next year, Luke will return to SS.

1950
After stroking a RBI single in the third inning, Joe DiMaggio strikes again
in the seventh with another run-scoring safety to collect his 2,000th career
hit. The Yankee Clipper reaches the milestone in an 8-2 victory in Cleveland,
the 1537th contest he has played in the major leagues.

1951
Bobby Avila's five hits, including three homeruns, helps the Indians beat
the Red Sox at Fenway, 14-8.

Cleveland IF Bobby Avila hits 3 HRs going 5 for 6 against the Red Sox. His 15
total bases will stand as a team record until surpassed by Rocky Colavito in
1959. Before today, Avila had hit just one homer against the Bosox. Cleveland
outslugs Boston to win 14-8, as Early Wynn earns the complete game win.

Tommy Holmes' first win as Braves manager is a breeze as Warren Spahn shuts
out the Cubs, 9-0, and is 3 for 4 at the plate, including a HR.

1952
The A's nip the visiting Tigers, 8-7, in the first of 2, then stall their
way to a 3-3 tie in the nitecap. Joe Astroth's single in the 9th drives
home the winner. For the fourth time as an Athletic (and the 2nd this year),
Billy Hitchcock pulls a successful hidden ball trick, nabbing Fred Hatfield
after a triple. In game 2, the Bengals score a pair in the top of the 10th
to go ahead, but the A's stall until the 6:59 PM curfew and the game reverts
to its 9th inning score.

Dodgers. The clouts by Hofman and Rhodes are pinch homers. For the 2nd day
in a row, Repulski belts a triple and homer for the Birds ... yesterday's
was inside-the-park. The Cards strand 17 runners, one short of the ML record.

hit pinch homeruns for the Giants.

1956
In the 7th and 8th innings at Detroit's Briggs Stadium, Mickey Mantle poles
2 Billy Hoeft pitches into the right CF bleachers, something no other player
had done since the bleachers were added in the late 1930s. New York wins,
4-1. Mantle is now leading in the Triple Crown race. Johnny Kucks (9-3)
is the winner with Whitey Ford in relief.

1957
In a 4-1 loss to the Orioles, the first place White Sox lose C Sherm Lollar

3rd player in history to hit a walkoff HR in their debut, joining Josh Bard
(8/23/02) and Billy Parker (9/9/71).

At San Diego, the home team Padres enter the bottom of the 9th down 3-0 to the

at the age of 51.
