1901
Boston arrives in Philadelphia for an expected game against the A's,
unaware that the schedule had been changed and they are supposed to be in
Baltimore. The Orioles squad and 4500 fans wait for an hour and a half in
90-degree heat for Boston to arrive. The AL umpire assigned to the game
showed up in Philley as well. The Athletics read the revised schedule and
play in Washington, losing 5-4.

At Brooklyn, the Pirates lose 16-3. Tommy Daly has 5 hits including 4 long
hits for Brooklyn - 3 doubles and a triple. He adds a stolen base, one of
7 in the game. In September he'll have another 5-hit game.

1902
The Giants uses a triple play - 6-4-3-2 - against the Phils but still lose
4-1. The Phillies use a courtesy runner when their catcher is hit in the
head. Feeling better he returns to play.

1903
Before the start of the Giants-Pirates showdown, Giants catcher Frank
Bowerman starts a fight with Pirates player-manager Fred Clarke in the
Giants' office. While the cause of the brawl is unclear, Pirates owner Barney
Dreyfuss reports it to the NL offices and Bowerman is fined $100. Clarke
gets no fine, but does take home a black eye. Mathewson then pitches his 5th
victory over Pittsburgh, defeating them 8-2, and beating Sam Leever. Sam
Mertes, who jumped from the AL and will lead the NL in doubles and RBIs,
doubles home 3 runs in the 5th. Veteran SS George Davis, 1900-1901 Giants
manager who played for the White Stockings in 1902 and was awarded to them as
part of the peace treaty, gets the approval of NL president Harry Pulliam to
play for the Giants. After Davis plays in 4 games, including today, for the
Giants, Chicago's owner Charles Comiskey gets an injunction preventing Davis
from playing. On July 20th the NL directors vote that Davis cannot play for
any team except the White Stockings. Davis sits out the rest of the season
but rejoins Chicago in 1904 and finishes a 20-year career with them in 1909.

1906
Herbert M. Whitney, a catcher for the Burlington Pathfinders, becomes the
first professional baseball player to die as a result of being hit by a
pitch, from Fred Evans. The beaning occurred two days ago in an Iowa State
League contest against the Waterloo Microbes.

At South End Grounds, the Giants roast the Beaneaters, 6-4, as Mathewson wins
his 8th game. The game is interrupted when fans charge onto the field after
2 spectators are arrested for gambling. The players "watch the exertions
of the police who had to beat off many would be rescuers" (Chicago Tribune).

Cub Orval Overall allows 3 hits and K's 11 in beating the Cardinals, 1-0.

1908
At Baltimore, Rube Waddell loses his first game as a Philadelphia Athletic,
7-3. The recently signed Rube will finish the year at 24-7 for the A's,
and lead the AL in strikeouts with 210.

1909
In Detroit, the Tigers bid a fond goodbye to the Browns by whipping them
and Rube Waddell, 6-2. It is the 8th straight game between the two teams,
in St. Louis and Detroit, and the Tigers win all eight.

1911
In Philadelphia, Grover Alexander shuts out the Boston Rustlers, 5-0. Phillies
catcher/manager Red Dooin suffers a broken leg in a collision at home. Dooin
will play in only 74 games that season. The speedy catcher had broken his
knee the year before.

1912
Boston's Smoky Joe Wood outguns the Senators' ace Walter Johnson to win,
3-0. Wood allows 3 hits to Big Train's 4. Johnson fans 10 batters in the loss.

The Yankees send future star Hippo Vaughn (2-8), winner of last year's
opener, to the Senators for the waiver price. In late August, Washington
will compound the mistake by selling him to Kansas City (AA).

1913
After failing in Cincinnati and moving across the Ohio River to Covington,
Kentucky, the Federal League team decides to relocate again. The franchise
shift to Kansas City, which is American Association territory, will cause
organized baseball to 'declare war' on the upstart league.

In the A's double header pasting of the host Senators, 11-2 and 10-3,
Nats catcher Eddie Ainsmith swipes 2B, 3B and home in the opener. In the
second game, the Senators attempt to change their luck by batting first
... it doesn't work.

The Giants sweep two from the Braves, winning 5-4 and 11-3. Mathewson
preserves the 1st win with 2 innings of relief, then starts the 2nd
contest. Led by Larry Doyle's grand slam off Otto Hess, the Giants forge
into a 9-0 lead after 6 innings and Matty exits. Mathewson now has throw
21 innings without a walk.

Brooklyn sees Alexander for a second day in a row, this time beating the
Phillies' righty, 4-2, in a doubleheader sweep by the Superbas. The Phils
win the opener, 5-2, and now lead the Giants by a half-game.

1914
In Boston, the Giants hammer the Braves for 27 hits, winning 8-4 and
10-4, and put Boston back in the cellar. Boston had moved into 7th with
yesterday's win over New York. Mathewson wins the opener over Lefty Tyler,
and Art Fromme wraps up the nitecap.

1915
Phillie ace Pete Alexander continues his masterful pitching, topping
Brooklyn's Jack Coombs, 4-0. Zack Wheat's 8th-inning single is the only
Dodger safety.

1916
The Indians became the first major league club to field a team with numbered
uniforms when they take on Chicago at Cleveland's League Park. Jack Graney,
leading off for the Tribe, is the first batter to wear a number in the 20th
century. Cleveland also puts up the numbers to win, 2-0. The use of large
numerals on the players' left sleeve and corresponding scorecards lasts
just a few weeks and, after a brief trial next season, the concept will be
totally abandoned.

The Dodgers split with the Giants, losing 11-8 before winning the nitecap,
2-1. New York takes a 6-0 lead in the opener, but the Dodgers score 5 in
the 5th off starter Bill Perritt, then put two on against reliever Rube
Schauer. Mathewson then takes over and George Cutshaw cranks a 3-run homer
to give the Dodgers an 8-6 lead. Matty allows just one other hit and New
York comes back against Duster Mails to win. It is Mathewson's last major
league victory. During the game, police at the Polo Grounds arrest three
fans for not throwing back baseballs hit into the stands.

1918
No mercy rule as the Cubs roll over the Cardinals, 14-0. The Cubs pile on
in the 4th inning when they pull off a triple steal against the battery of
Sherdel and Gonzales. Three ex-American Leaguers, Charley Deal, Zeider and
Killifer, do the wholesale thievery. After Lefty Tyler walks to reload the
bases, Max Flack clears them with a grand slam.

The Yankees top the Red Sox, 3-1, as Babe Ruth scores the only Sox run
following a double. Babe injures his wrist sliding into second base and
will repeat the injury tomorrow on the same play.

The Senators edge the St. Louis Browns, 3-2. And now we know why Frank
Shulte is called wildfire as Jimmy Austin of the Browns nabs him with a
successful hidden ball trick.

1920
In Cincinnati, Reds P Dolf Luque swings at umpire Bill Klem, accusing
the arbiter of "vicious language." Fans chip in with several thrown pop
bottles, protesting an earlier Klem call at home plate. The Cardinals win
the battle, 5-0.

In Philadelphia, Clyde Milan lines a 9th inning single to give Washington a
4-3 win over the Athletics. For the Quakers, it is their 17th straight defeat.

Behind the one-hit pitching of Warren "Rip" Collins, making his 3rd ML start,
the Yankees roll over the Red Sox, 14-0. Eddie Foster has the only safety
for Boston.

Lou Gehrig gets his first national mention when, as a high school junior
for New York City's School of Commerce, he steals the show in a high school
championship game against Lane Tech in Chicago. His grand-slam HR in the
8th gives the NY team a 12-8 victory. Scouts sit with open mouths as the
ball sails out of Cubs Park (later known as Wrigley Field).

1924
President and Mrs. Coolidge are on hand in Washington as Walter Johnson
shuts out the A's, 5-0. For the front-running Senators, it is their 10th
straight win.

In the first pitching matchup of brothers in ML history, Jesse Barnes of the
Boston Braves opposes his younger brother Virgil of the New York Giants at
the Polo Grounds. Virgil receives a no-decision while Jesse takes the loss
as the Giants win, 8-1. The Barnes will match up four more times during
their careers, including three days from now.

1925
Before 30,000 fans in Philadelphia, Walter Johnson and rookie Lefty Grove
square off in a battle of the AL leaders. Grove, a winner of 108 games
in 5 years at Baltimore, was Mack's high-priced purchase last October. Al
Simmons slams a 2-run HR in the 3rd for the A's, but Goose Goslin rips a
3-run HR off Grove in the 7th to give Washington a 5-3 win.

1926
The Cardinals move into 2nd with an 8-7 win over the Cubs at Wrigley. Bill
Hallahan is victorious over Charlie Root.

1927
In Washington, the Senators make it 3 straight over Boston, winning 8-7,
scoring all of their runs in the 4th inning. Former Senator Buddy Myer belts
a homer off Walter Johnson, who lasts 5 innings and gets credit for the
win. Johnson will serve up six gopher balls to the Red Sox in his career,
all in Washington. Goose Goslin homers off Tony Welzer.

1934

takes the loss. Newly acquired Bob Seeds, up from Newark, leads the way with
a 470-foot inside the park homer to the Eddie Grant memorial in dead center.

In the Phils-Reds split, Reds leadoff hitter Lonnie Frey bangs out 8 hits,
just the 3rd Red player to collect 8 hits in a twinbill (Miller - 10/9/98
and Cuyler - 7/30/36). Frey is 5 for 5 in game 2 as the Reds win 8-5 behind
Derringer. Claude Passeau wins the opener, 10-3 for the Phils. Jordan has
4 hits, and Weintraub and Klein hit homers.

1939

1941
Yankee P Mario Russo loses a no-hitter in the 7th inning when the Browns'
George McQuillan - a future Yankee - homers. Henrich homers for New York
to extend New York's consecutive homer streak to 21 games. Then in the
8th, Henrich bunts Red Rolfe to 2B to give the hitless DiMaggio another
at-bat. Joe doubles on the first pitch off Eldon Auker to run his streak
to 38 games. New York wins, 4-1, and takes over first place.

Sox, 11-8.

Harland Clift has a 3-run HR and Chet Laabs a 3-run double as the Browns
beat the Senators, 6-5. Nats P Buck Newsom bats lefty in his 2nd AB against
Auker and singles. He resumes his natural righty at-bat on his next turn
and makes an out.

1944
More than 50,000 pack the Polo Grounds to watch the Yankees, Dodgers

then sits out an inning. The final score is Dodgers 5, Yankees 1, Giants 0.

1945

Giants to an 11-0 win over the Cubs. Hooks allows 2 hits while striking
out 8. The Giants collect 13 hits including 2 homers.

Carl DeRose, Kansas City (AA) righthander, tosses the first perfect game in
AA history, beating Minneapolis, 5-0. DeRose, who has been out a month with
a sore arm and still pitches with pain, throws just 93 pitches in retiring
all 27 batters. He'll pitch just twice more this year.

1948
Yale wins the second game of the College World Series, 8-3, behind the
pitching of Frank Quinn, as Southern Cal strands 14 runners. George Bush
has a single and two RBIs for the Eli. In the second game, USC jumps to a
6-0 lead and coasts home, 9-2. Southern Cal's Gail Henley signs with the

1958

1959
The "Emperor's game," the greatest in Japanese baseball history, is played
by the Yomiuri Giants and the Hanshin Tigers, with Emperor Hirohito and
his wife attending at Tokyo's Korakuen Stadium. The game is tied 4-4 in
the 7th on Giants rookie Sadaharu Oh's 2-run HR, then won 5-4 in the last
of the 9th on a HR by the Giant's Shigeo Nagashima. This starts the famed
"O-N cannon," the hitting combination of Oh and Nagashima, that will bring
the Giants 9 pennants between 1965 and 1973. In all, the O-N cannon hits
dual HRs in 106 games.

1960
With the help of Ron Santo, making his major league debut, the Cubs sweep
a doubleheader from first-place Pittsburgh, 7-5 and 7-6. The rookie third
baseman goes 3 for 7, driving in five runs during the twin bill at Forbes
Field.

Hoping to speed up the election process, the Hall of Fame changes its
voting procedures. The new rules allow the Special Veterans Committee to
vote annually, rather than every other year, and to induct up to 2 players
a year. The BBWAA is authorized to hold a runoff election of the top 30
vote getters if no one is elected in the first ballot.

1961
The Yankees beat the Angels, 8-6, and Yogi Berra collects his 2000th career
hit, all as a Bronx Bomber. To celebrate the achievement a huge cake is
rolled out in Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. Angel reliever Art Fowler, who
has allowed just one hit in his last 12 innings, serves up a 9th-inning HR
to Bill Skowron. Mantle adds an earlier homer, off Ken McBride, and Ford

the team has scored in the last 70 innings.

At New York, the Cubs break a 4-4 tie in the 14th when Billy Williams lines
a 2-run inside-the-park homerun. The 6-4 lead dissolves in the bottom of the
inning when the Mets' Tim Harkness hits a grand slam on a 3-2 pitch with two
outs off Cub reliever Jim Brewer. Brewer, in to relieve Paul Toth, walks Sammy

date ($200,000) as he signs with Angels.

consecutive 9-inning appearances on his way to a 2-1 win in Atlanta.

the face by a Jack Fisher pitch that fractures his cheek. Before Santo's
at-bat, the Mets Ron Hunt and the Cubs Adolfo Phillips had both been hit by
pitches. Santo will be operated on tomorrow but will return to action in a
week. The injury ends his consecutive game streak at 390, but his 27-game
hitting streak (one shy of the franchise mark) continues.

1968
Cardinals right-hander Bob Gibson tosses his fifth consecutive shutout as
he blanks the Pirates, 3-0, in the first game of a doubleheader played at

Dodgers. Pittsburgh wins the 2nd game 3-1, although the Cardinals stop
Maury Wills' 24-game hitting streak.

schedules in 1969 and operate two 6-team divisions.

1970
Frank Robinson belts two successive grand slams during a 12-2 Oriole romp over
the Senators, just the 7th major leaguer to ever accomplish the feat. Dave
McNally, the winning pitcher, Don Buford and Paul Blair trot home ahead of
him on each blow. They will be Robby's only grand slams for the O's. The
Orioles will lose C Clay Dalrymple tomorrow when he breaks his ankle in a
home plate collision with the Nats' Mike Epstein.

Trailing 2-1 in the 5th, the Angels' Steve Kealey comes in and induces
Amos Otis to hit into a triple play (he hit into a double play in the

will hit another slam on July 4. Teammate Glenn Adams drives in eight as
the Twins beat the White Sox 19-12.

In front of 55,039 fans, the Yankees complete a 3-game sweep of the Red Sox,
avenging the three losses last week to the Sox at Fenway. New York takes a

Paul Blair bounces a bases-loaded ball over the head of Butch Hobson at 3B
to pin the loss on reliever Bill Campbell.

In a sweep of Texas, both by 4-3 scores, Angels 2B Jerry Remy has 26 chances,
an AL record (game 1 - 4 PO, 12 A in 11 innings; game 2 - 5 PO, 5 A). This
comes 2 days after 2B Don Money ties the AL mark with 12 assists.

1978
Toronto's Dave McKay and Otto Velez each hit 2 doubles in one inning during
a 24-10 rout of Baltimore. With the score 19-6 following a homer by Lee
May, Earl Weaver tosses OF Larry Harlow at the Blue Jays. Harlow gets 2
batters out in the 5th, then walks 3 in a row and hurls a wild pitch. He
then allows a single, a walk and a three-run HR by John Mayberry to make the
score 24-6. Mayberry comes off the bench to hit a 3-run homer, a 2-run homer
and a 2-run double good for 7 RBIs. The last non-starter to have 7 RBIs was
Roy Sievers in June of 1961. Bullpen catcher Ellie Hendricks then relieves
Harlow and gives up just a walk and no runs in 2 1/3 innings. Closer Don
Stanhouse takes over in the 8th.

1979
The Yankees re-acquire the popular Bobby Murcer from the Cubs in exchange
for P Paul Semall and cash. Murcer will once again thrive in Yankee Stadium
hitting .273 with 8 HRs.

1980
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn voids the Yankees' drafting of highly touted high
school shortstop Billy Cannon Jr Four teams had complained that Billy
Cannon Sr, college football's Heisman Trophy winner in 1959, misled them
with telegrams saying that his son would go to college, in the hopes that
he would then be drafted by the Yankees. In a special draft, the Indians
will pick Cannon but he chooses to attend Texas A & M instead. The young
Cannon will be drafted number one by the Dallas Cowboys in 1984.

1982
Despite managing just one hit in each game, the Appleton Foxes (Midwest
League) sweep a doubleheader from the Wisconsin Rapids, 2-1 and 1-0.

hit. The 'Le Grand Orange' equals the 1958 mark established by Dave Philley

snapped by Cards Bruce Sutter 3 days from now.

Baltimore's Storm Davis holds the Tigers hitless for 8 innings, then needs
help from reliever Tippy Martinez to complete a 3-1 victory. Pinch hitter

At Jack Russell Stadium, the organist, is ejected by umpire Keith O'Connor
from a Class A Florida League game for playing Three Blind Mice following
a close call at first base which goes against the Clearwater Phillies. The

Three Blind Mice organist" as the incident is reported by NBC's Today
show weatherman Willard Scott and is heard on Paul Harvey's syndicated
radio program.

Tony LaRussa.

1987
Although the Red Sox have a 9-0 second-inning lead over the Yankees, Roger
Clemens is unable to hold the lead with the Yankees winning 12-11 in ten
innings. Boston's third baseman Wade Boggs sees his 25-game hitting streak
come to an end. The 9-run comeback ties a Yankee team record. Boston, alas,
has blown bigger leads.

You gotta give him credit for trying. Paul Noce of the Cubs ties a ML record
(tied 11 days ago) in the 3rd inning by twice being thrown out trying to
steal. A dropped ball leaves him safe at 2B after he is caught, then he is
thrown out trying to steal 3B. Pittsburgh beats Greg Maddux and the Cubs,
5-2. Maddux will finish 6-14, his last losing season.

1991

of Tiger Stadium in an 8-7 win over the Brewers. The Tigers break a 7-7
tie with 2 outs in the 9th.

Cory Davis' 434-foot homer off San Diego's Craig Lefferts keeps the Giants
from being shut out three straight times.

1992
The Padres top the Giants, 6-2, scoring 4 runs in the 4th. The Pads might've
scored more but Tony Fernandez is thrown out twice in the inning, matching

be successful on just half ... this is the worst percentage for anyone with
20 steals since Jack Fournier in 1923.

1993
Knoxville Smokies pitcher Travis Baptist is the first pitcher to be ejected
and fined for using snuff. The rule banning smoking and chewing tobacco in the
