1905
At Brooklyn, the Giants tally 7 runs in the first 3 innings off Mal Eason to
coast to an 11-1 victory. Mathewson leaves after 5 innings of shutout ball,
and Claude Eason tosses the last 4 innings. Dan McGann paces the offense with
a triple and homer, while Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham, in his only game in
the majors, takes over in right field as a late inning replacement. Graham
will have no at-bats but will be made famous in W.P. Kinsella's book
"Shoeless Joe" and the movie based on the author's work, "Field of Dreams."

1907
The Pirates top the Cubs, 2-1, as CF Tommy Leach cuts down Harry Steinfeldt at
the plate in the 9th inning. Deacon Phillipe is the winner over Ed Reulbach,
who loses his first to stop a winning streak of 17 games over 2 seasons,
5 of them this year. The 17 straight wins is a NL record for the 20th
century that will be topped by Rube Marquard in 1912.

At Cincinnati, the Reds edge the Cardinals, 4-3, in 14 innings. The Cards'
versatile Art Hoelskoetter hits his first ML homer, off Jake Weimer, but it
is not enough. In 4 seasons in St. Louis, Hoelskoetter plays at least 15 games
at every infield position, including pitcher, and another 20 in the outfield.

In a 12-2 win over Cleveland, Ty Cobb steals home in the 6th on the front end
of a double steal. Heinie Berger and Howard Wakefield are the battery. It

on July 5.

1909
Pitching against the Highlanders, Johnson gives up a solo homer to Ray
Demmitt in the 7th, the first homerun he's allowed since his debut in 1907,

the 2nd time in 10 days.

Playing their last game in Exposition Park in front of 5,545 fans, the
Pirates score 4 runs in the first inning off Mordecai Brown and sail to an
8-1 win over Chicago. Lefty Leifield is the winner. Tomorrow, the Pirates

captured Ft. Duquesne during the French and Indian Wars. Forbes Field is
baseball's first stadium to be constructed with concrete and steel.

1910
At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson relieves in the 9th with the Giants ahead

with the game winner.

1912
Rube Marquard's NL-record consecutive game winning streak (20th century)
goes to an amazing 18-0 as he tops Boston, 8-6, for New York's 12th straight

At Fenway, the Red Sox sweep two from the Yankees, winning 13-6 and 6-0. Smoky
Joe Wood wins the nitecap, his 2nd shutout in a row, allowing just one hit, in
winning 6-0 in 7 innings. Sterrett's single is the lone hit. In the nitecap,
Hick Cady makes two hits in one at-bat. His single scores Jake Stahl from 3B,
but umpire Frank O' Loughlin rules that Stahl was balked home. In Cady's
2nd chance, he doubles. Yankee infielder Birdie Cree has his wrist broken
when he is hit by a pitch from Buck O'Brien. He will be out for the season.

1913
The Reds defeat the Cubs, 9-6, at Redlands Field using only one ball.
There are no homeruns or foul balls which land in the stands during the
contest. The Enquirer reports the ball was pretty battered. Joe Tinker
pockets it as a souvenir.

At Philadelphia, New York's thrilling 11-10 win over the Phils puts the
Giants on top to stay and ends the dream of an all-Philadelphia World
Series. Hooks Wiltse pitches the first 9 innings for New York before wilting,
and Mathewson relieves. In the 10th, Buck Herzog singles off Pete Alexander
and Matty wins his 14th. The fireworks continue after the game when McGraw,
walking to the clubhouse with several Phillies, is belted and then jumped by
several Philley fans. McGraw is cut up and Phils P Ad Brennan is identified
as the instigator of the fight. After investigating, NL Prexy Thomas Lynch
will suspend both McGraw and Brennan for 5 days, with Brennan also fined $100.

Behind the pitching of Eddie Plank, the Athletics beat New York, 6-0,
and maintain a lead of 8 1/2 games in the AL.

1914
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Dodgers battle to a split. Brooklyn
lurches to an 8-7 win in the opener. In game 2, Giants starter Jeff Tesreau
is tossed in the 3rd inning for disputing a call, and Mathewson rushes in
to relieve with the score 1-1. New York scores 4 in the 3rd off Frank Allen
and goes on to win, 8-6.

With attendance down in the Federal League, Robert Ward, president of the
Brooklyn Tip Tops, announces that ticket prices at Washington Park will

hits for him in the 10th.

In the 7th inning of game 1, Cards LF Cozy Dolan's single hits his own glove
in the grass behind third. Buc LF Max Carey hustles in and throws Dolan out
trying for a double (as noted by Clem Comly). Pittsburgh wins the opener,
8-6 and the Cards rebound in the nitcap, 6-4.

1916

Ryan, and will be announced by Bob Figg. Other features include autographed
balls by President Wilson to be auctioned off by Judge Cermak, as well as
a grenade-throwing contest between the two teams. The grenades are duds.

1919
With Babe Ruth at 1B for the injured Stuffy McInnis, Carl Mays shuts out

In the second inning of St. Louis' 7-3 victory over New York, Ethan Allen
races around the bases for an inside-the-park homerun at the Polo Grounds,
but is called out for batting out of turn costing Joe Medwick his turn at the
plate. Then the Cardinal outfielder bats for himself in the correct order,
but grounds out.

1934
On the hottest June 29th in New York history (101 degrees), the first-place
Giants hand the visiting Dodgers their 8th straight defeat, 7-2. Travis
Jackson lines a 3-run homer in the first off Mungo. The ball rattles
under the bullpen bench in RF allowing Jackson to circle the bases. Fred
Fitzsimmons scatters 11 hits for the win.

score to back Lon Warneke's win over Red Lucas. Chicago moves into 2nd
place with the victory.

1937
The Cubs nip St. Louis 11-9, as Rip Collins has no putouts or assists at 1B,
a NL record. He is the only NL 1B this century to have such an easy day
at the office, while catcher Gabby Hartnett and LF Augie Galan each have
8. This is just the third occurrence of a first baseman not having a PO, and
the second time for Collins, who also didn't make a put out playing first
for the Cardinals in a game played against the Braves two seasons ago. The
next first baseman to match today's rare feat will be Norm Cash in 1963.

1940
Bob Feller fans 11 White Sox in gaining his 12th win of the year, 7-3. Lee

in the 6th inning, and in the nightcap 'the Yankee Clipper' tops the record
with a seventh inning single against Walt Masterson. In the first game,

the Philadelphia Phillies. The club recently lost a team-record 16
straight. Chapman was acquired as a pitcher from the Dodgers for Johnny
Peacock on June 15th, but is better known as the Yankee outfielder
and base-stealing star. Chapman will be the NL's first player-manager
since Jimmy Wilson (1934-39) when he appears in three games. Fitzsimmons'
final game is a 9-1 loss to the Cards at Shibe Park. Del Rice has three
hits, three runs and three RBIs to pace the Birds. During his tenure, the
Tennessean tactician will compile a 196-276 record (.415) finishing in the
second division each of the four seasons he manages.

The Senators jump on Stubby Overmire for 5 runs in the first inning and topple
the first-place Tigers, 8-3. The Tigers lead the Yankees by a half-game.

line drive. The Yanks will give the 42-year-old his release in late September
and he will sign with the White Sox for the '47 season.

1947
In game 2 at Philadelphia, Ferris Fain lines an inside-the-park grand slam

drives in 5 runs with a grand slam and a double to lead the Bucs to a 7-3
win over the Reds. Lombardi gets the win. Virgil Stallcup's 3-run homer is
the scoring for Cincy.

1950
In an effort to thwart the ML's signing of black players, Dr. J. B. Martin,
the president of the Chicago Giants of the Negro American League, instructs
manager, Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe to sign white players. Radcliffe
inks three white players, teenagers Lou Chirban, Lou Clarizio and Al
Dubetts. Later in the year he will sign at least two others (Stanley Miarka
and Frank Dyall). However, their Negro League careers will be brief.

In what looks like a football score, the Red Sox overpower the A's 22-14 in
Philadelphia, the 3rd time this month they've scored 20 or more runs. The 36
runs establishes an AL mark for runs scored by 2 teams. Both teams match a ML
record they set in 1901 for most players scoring two or more runs (Boston -
9, Phila - 4). Overall, pitchers give up 21 walks in the debacle. Despite
the high score, only one HR was hit - by Ted Williams - in a game one
newspaper calls "a 2 hour and 50 minute marathon." The previous record of
35 runs was set by the same 2 clubs in 1901 ... Boston 23, A's 12. The ML
mark is 49 by the Cubs and Phillies on August 25, 1922.

with a double, then scoring what will be the winning run as the Brewers win,
5-4 (as noted by historian Bob O'Neal).

1951
Richard J. Conway, 19, catcher of the Twin Falls (Pioneer) club, dies at
John Affleck Park in Ogden, Utah after being struck over the heart by a

The NL suspends manager Leo Durocher for 4 days for misconduct.

The Kansas City Blues slam 10 homers against St. Paul to set an American
Association record for most HRs by one team and tie the record for most by

both AA marks, enroute to a 17-4 win. Roy Partee has 3 homers, including two
in the big inning. Vic Power, Kal Segrist and Bill Renna have two apiece,
and Andy Carey hits one. St. Paul hits none.

The Dodgers' Tommy Holmes, fired as Braves manager a month ago, hits a pinch
single in the 7th against his old club to help Brooklyn to a 6-5 win over
the Braves. The Dodgers have now whipped the Braves 11 straight in 1952.

Down 8-2 with 2 outs and no one on in the 9th inning of game 1, the Cubs
rally for 7 runs and beat the Reds 9-8. Ex-Red Johnny Pramesa knocks home the
winning run, as the Cubs set an NL record with the biggest two-out none-on 9th
inning rally in history (since tied NL record - in 2001 - for most runs in the
9th with 2 out). The effort exhausts the Cubs as they drop the nitecap, 9-1.

1954

they are swept by the Dodgers at Connie Mack Stadium, 6-3 and 5-2. The 24
K's ties a major league record for strike outs in a twin bill.

1961
With 3 round-trippers at Philadelphia - one a 10th-inning shot to win 8-7
- Willie Mays becomes the 4th ML player with 3 or more HRs twice in one
season. Manager Gene Mauch's efforts to conceal his starting pitcher and
force Al Dark's hand has a Phillie lineup including hurlers Don Ferrarese
(batting leadoff, playing CF), Jim Owens (3rd, RF), Chris Short (7th, C)
and Ken Lehman (9th, P) against San Francisco. When Dark sends lefty Billy
O'Dell to the mound for one batter, Mauch replaces Ferrarese, Short and
Owen. Dark then replaces Billy O'Dell with Sam Jones. Mauch replaces Lehman
with Dallas Green after 2 batters. All the maneuvering takes 3 hours 20
minutes. The Giants then take the nitecap, 4-1, as Mays triples and doubles
home 2 runs and completes a DP with a throw home.

shot, then sandwiches a homer between round trippers by Bobby Richardson
and Joe Pepitone in the 3rd inning in New York's 6-5 win. The consecutive
trifecta was last done for the Yankees in 1947, when Keller, DiMaggio and
Lindell connected. Richardson is 5 for 5 in the game. Mantle's two homers
today, his 37th and 38th at Fenway, will be his last in Boston, and ties
him with Babe Ruth for most homers by a Sox opponent.

1967
The Reds jump on Don Drysdale on their way to a 14-0 pasting of the Dodgers.

1968
Jim Northrup's 3rd grand slam ties the ML record for slams in a month

the Royals. Kansas City takes the opener, 7-2, behind homers by Fiore and
Oliver. Oliva flied out his first time up, then stroked 3 singles. In the
Twins' 12-2 win in game two, Oliva hits 2 homers, a double and two singles,

shoulder in 1990, and Sutcliffe will not lose again in the regular season.

1986

at the end of the season. Toliver will get in 9 games with no decisions.

1990
Oakland's Dave Stewart and the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela both throw
no-hitters today, the first time this has happened since Hippo Vaughan and
Fred Toney's double no-hitter in 1917. Stewart blanks the Blue Jays 5-0,
and a few hours later Valenzuela beats the Cardinals, 6-0. The only threat
to Stewart is a fly ball by Fred McGriff that Dave Henderson catches with
his back pinned to the wall. Fernando almost loses his no-hitter with 1

and is now 0-4 since the Padres acquired him for Fernando Valenzuela.

Justice will take over in LF. Justice, with 58 RBI, will knock in another
60 with the Yankees, the first player to collect 50 RBIs in a season with
two teams. Mike Piazza in 1998 with LA-FLA-NY is the only player to have

records his 4,000 career strikeout whiffing Padres third baseman Jeff
Cirillo, a fellow USC Trojan, to become the fourth player in major league
baseball history to reach the plateau. The 'Big Unit' (3,237 1/3) needs less

major leagues, ironically is told of the decision when Florida is playing
a series in Puerto Rico, five minutes away from his home.

In the Twins' 11-4 victory over Detroit at Target Field, Denard Span ties

John Baker becomes the first position player to earn a victory since Oriole
first baseman Chris Davis accomplished the feat in 2012. In the six-hour

scoreless 16th inning and then scores the winning run in the bottom of the
frame, giving Chicago a 4-3 victory over Colorado.

2019
The Orioles became the first team in Major League history to score at
least 13 runs each in consecutive shutout games. Both games were against
the Cleveland Indians.

2021
Kyle Schwarber of Washington with his leadoff homerun against Rich Hill of
the Tampa Bay Rays, tied the Major League record for most homeruns in any
ten-game stretch with 12 homeruns. He tied the record set by the Indians'
Albert Belle in 1995. The homerun also tied the Major League record for most
homeruns in an 18-game stretch with 16. He joins the Giants' Barry Bonds
(2001) and Cubs' Sammy Sosa (1998) with this feat.
