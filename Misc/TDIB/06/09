Jun 9

1901
Overflow crowds ringing the outfields of small parks is a frequent
occurrence. At Cincinnati on this Sunday afternoon, the first-place Giants
lead 15-4 after 6 innings before 17,000 fans. Ground-rule doubles multiply,
and 19 more runs score in the next 2 1/2 innings. When the crowd edges
onto the infield with two outs in the 9th and the Giants leading 25-13,
umpire Bob Emslie forfeits the game to New York, the 2nd of 2 forfeits this
year. The Reds make 18 hits. The Giants register a 20th century record 31
hits, led by the outfield:  Kip Selbach is 6 for 7, and "Piano Legs" Hickman
and George Van Haltren have 5 hits apiece for a NL record 16. Hickman and
Van Haltren score 5 runs apiece. The Giants also set a ML record for most
runs without a HR, a mark that will be tied by Cleveland in 1930. The two
teams combine for a NL record 36 singles, 22 by New York. Only one Giant
will return to the team in 1902 ... 5 will go to the AL, and 3 will retire.

1903
At St. Louis, the Giants win easily, 11-2, over the Cards. With the game
in hand, Mathewson (12-2) is lifted in the 7th for Roscoe Miller.

Kaiser Wilhelm, the 29-year-old rookie for Pittsburgh, holds the Phils
scoreless for 3 innings before they score a run in the 4th breaking the
Pirates' record run of 6 straight shutouts and 56 scoreless innings. The
Pirates score 6 runs in the 1st three innings off Bill Duggleby and win, 7-3.

1905
The A's Rube Waddell loses after 10 wins in a row as the White Sox beat
him 3-2 in 14 innings. Waddell will be 26-11 for the Athletics this year.
His 1.48 ERA will be the AL's best.

The Giants score 5 runs in the top of the first against Sam Leever, but
the Pirates come back with 6 runs off Joe McGinnity in the bottom of the
inning. Mathewson relieves in the 2nd but 6 Giant errors help sink the
visiting New Yorkers. Pitt wins, 12-6.

1906
A NL record 19-game losing streak ends for the Boston Beaneaters (NL)
with a 6-3 win over the Cardinals.

Under threatening skies, the host Phillies take the field in the 8th
inning holding a 1-0 lead over the Pirates. As the Pirates rally the Phils
stop trying for outs, hoping that umpire Bill Klem will call the game and
declare them 1-0 winners. But after 7 runs cross the plate, Klem declares
a forfeit and the fans erupt. In two weeks the NL will instruct all clubs
to provide dressing areas for visiting teams, so they do not have to change
in their hotel.

1907
Throwing the only perfect game of his career, Weiser (Idaho) P Walter Johnson
beats Emmett, 11-0. He strikes out 14, and the game helps bring him to the
attention of the Washington Nationals.

1909
Benjamin Shibe, of Bala, Pennsylvania, obtains a patent for a cork-center
baseball. Spalding will license the idea and manufacturer a ball.

The Red Sox edge the Browns, 3-2, scoring the winning run in the 8th
inning. Ed Cicotte, relieving for Jack Ryan, pitches the last 3 innings
for the victory. (In most record books, Cicotte is erroneously listed
as pitching just one inning and is credited with a save. Researcher Dix
Tourangeau noted the error).

1911
Pete Alexander tosses 4 innings of relief to preserve a 4-3 Phillie win
over the Reds.

At Forbes Field, the Giants keep their hold on 1st place with a 6-3 win
against Pittsburgh's Lefty Leifield. Christy Mathewson is the winner.

1912
In St. Louis, Red Sox rookie Hugh Bedient coasts to a 9-2 win over the
Browns. Tris Speaker, the AL's leading hitter, is 4 for 5 off Roy Mitchell,
hitting for the cycle to pace the Boston attack.

1913
In Chicago, the Giants score 6 runs in the 3rd inning, against Lou Richie
and Lefty Leifield, and roll to an 11-3 win. Mathewson goes 8 innings before
Jim Thorpe pinch hits for him.

At Philadelphia, the Phillies' Beals Becker, acquired 4 days ago from the
Reds, lines two inside-the-park homers, one short of the record set in the
19th century. His new team beats his old team, 10-1.

The Red Sox finally stop Cleveland's Cy Falkenberg, who was 10-0 going into
today's game. The Sox win, 4-1.

1914
At the Baker Bowl, Honus Wagner joins Cap Anson as the only members of
the 3,000 hit club when he collects a 9th-inning double off the Phillies'
Erskine Mayer, and scores the Bucs lone run in a 3-1 loss. It comes in
Wagner's 2,332nd game. Lajoie will join the club in September. (Later
calculations put the date at June 30th or July 4th). Wagner shows skills by
tricking Beals Becker to try and take 3B and then tagging him out ... with
the Phils up 3-0, in the 8th he nabs Becker at 2B with a hidden ball trick.

With Bob Shawkey on the mound, the A's top the Tigers, 7-1. Detroit's only
score comes in the 4th when Ty Cobb steals home.

1915
The Phils move into first place, as Alexander flirts again with a no-hitter,
holding the Cubs hitless until the 7th. The Phils win, 4-3, in the 11th,
beating Larry Cheney. Alexander will be 31-10 and lead the NL with a 1.55
ERA, 36 CG, 376 IP, 241 strikeouts and 12 shutouts.

In St. Louis, the Cardinals collect 7 runs in the 7th inning as they hold
off the Giants to win, 11-10. It is not the only loss ... Owen Wilson has
his wallet and $700 stolen from the clubhouse during the game. The trainer
reports that he had fallen asleep there and when he awoke he saw a stranger
who said he was getting a drink of water.

The 2nd-place Tigers paste the Red Sox, 15-0. With lefty Ray Collins on
the mound in the 3rd, Ty Cobb swipes home, one of his 3 steals on the
day. His steal attempt in the first inning cuts up SS Ev Scott, forcing
him to retire. The Tigers manage 17 hits, including 4 by Veach. Dauss,
with 6 IP, is the winner.

At New York, the White Sox pound the Yankees, 13-0, as Eddie Cicotte allows
just 2 hits. Braggo Roth leads the attack with a homer, triple and single.

1916
Walter Johnson beats Cleveland, 7-4, for a Washington win.

In Detroit, consecutive doubles by Bobby Veach and George Burns stop Ruth's
scoreless innings at 25. Ruth evens the score with the longest drive ever
seen at Navin Field, into the RF bleachers. When Ruth tires in the 9th,
Carl Mays relieves and loses, 6-5. Ruth is 3 for 3 at-bat.

1917
The White Sox move into first place in the AL. They will swap the top spot
with the Red Sox until August 18th when they will pull away to a final
9-game margin.

1918
Washington's Walter Johnson allows one hit - a single by Oscar Vitt -
in beating the Tigers, 2-0.

1919
Against the Reds in Cincinnati, Rube Marquard breaks a leg when he stumbles
rounding 2B in the 5th, limiting him to a 3-3 record for the Dodgers. The
hurler will end his 18-year Hall of Fame career in 1925 after compiling a
201-177 record along with an ERA of 3.08. The Reds win today, 7-3.

Browns 1B George Sisler beats Washington, 2-1, with 2 hits off Walter Johnson,
driving in one run and scoring the other. He also makes an assist and putout
when he gets a glove on a ground ball hit wide of 1B. The ball bounds toward
2B, and Sisler gets back to 1B to take the throw in time.

1920
Former Chicago OF Lee Magee loses his suit against the Cubs. He had charged
that he was released without just cause last February. While on the witness
stand, Magee admitted to having bet on the first game of a doubleheader
with Cincinnati on July 25, 1918, while a member of the Reds. He said he
bet $500 along with Hal Chase. He said he found out after the game that
the money had been bet on Boston and stopped payment on the check to the
bookmaker. Chase's check went through. The Reds won the game in the 13th
on Roush's HR. Christy Mathewson testifies that as the Reds' manager he
was suspicious that all was not right in the game.

The Yankees come from behind to club the host Tigers, 13-6. Pacing the Yanks
are Bob Meusel, with a double and two singles, and George Mogridge with a
bases-loaded double before the Tigers knock him out. Ruth has a single,
two walks and is hit with a pitch. The Tigers are playing without Cobb,
out ten days with an injured knee.

1922
James C. Dunn, who brought Cleveland its first pennant as Indians president
in 1920, dies. He is succeeded by former newspaperman Ernest S. Barnard,
who will later become AL president.

At Chicago, the Yankees use a courtesy runner against the White Sox (as noted
by Retrosheet). On a 2-out single to SS, Wally Schang is injured in the 6th
inning when he slides into 1B, and is replaced by Al De Vormer. After the
3rd out, Schang returns to catching. When Schang reaches base in the 8th,
De Vormer again runs for him, this time staying in to catch.

1927
Walter Johnson (1-2) loses his 2nd game in a row as the Indians pound
him, 7-1, knocking him out in 5 innings. Johnson allows 6 hits and has
2 strikeouts.

At New York, the Yanks win the 3rd straight over Chicago, winning 8-3. New
York knocks Blankenship out of the box in the 7th and Ray Morehart hits
reliever Cole's 1st pitch for a 3-run homer. Babe Ruth follows with a triple
and then steals home. The Yanks score 6 in the frame.

1928
Outfielder Charlie Jamieson starts his 2nd triple play in 3 weeks, this
time against the Yanks in the 2nd inning. Ben Paschal is on 3B and Lazzeri
on 1st, when Jamieson snags a line drive hit by Joe Dugan. Charlie's quick
throw to 1B Lew Fonseca nabs Lazzeri, and Paschal is out at home when he
tries to score. Again, Cleveland is on the losing end, as New York wins 7-3.

1929
Babe Herman's bases-loaded 2B in the 8th pushes the lowly Dodgers past the
league-leading Pirates, 9-6. Jess Petty is the loser, giving up 14 hits. The
Waner brothers each hit a homer off starter McWeeny, but the win goes to
Dudley in relief. It is the 2nd time the Waners have homered in the same game.

1930
A game at old Washington Park in Indianapolis is the first night game in the
American Association. The Indians will open Perry Field next year to replace
Washington Park. In 1937, Minneapolis will be the last AA team to light up.

1932
Hack Wilson avenges an April humiliation as he clouts a first inning grand
slam off Chicago's Pat Malone to lead the Robins to a 5-2 win. Hack also
drives home the 5th run. Weeks ago in Chicago, the Cubs had walked a man
to load the bases for Wilson, who then grounded into a DP. The fans heaped
scorn on Hack and showered lemons onto the field. Wilson's five RBIs is
a birthday present for the 21-year-old Van Lingle Mungo, who finishes the
win in an hour and 37 minutes. His only mistake is a two-run homer to Gabby
Hartnett in the 2nd.

Mel Ott duplicates his effort of two days ago by clouting a pair of homers
in the Giants' 3-2 win over the Reds at the Polo Grounds. The clouts help
Mooney best Carroll. The southpaw allows just three hits after Larry Grantham
connect for a homer in the 2nd. The win moves the Giants to 22-29.

St. Louis veteran Jess Haines allows just five hits - three in the 9th -
to beat the Braves' 20-year-old Bob Brown, 2-1. It is Brown's first loss of
the year. The 4th place Cards score twice in the 6th on doubles by Pepper
Martin and Frisch, and singles by Rip Collins and Ernie Orsatti.

The Indians outhit the A's 16 to 15 and beat Philadelphia 9-8, dropping
the A's from 3rd to 5th place. The Tribe is paced by George Myatt, who has
a homer and 5 RBIs, and Burnett with four hits. Al Simmons homers for the
A's while Foxx, the triple crown leader, is 1 for 5.

The Browns send P Dick Coffman (5-3) to the Senators for lefty Carl Fischer
(3-1). Neither will pitch well for their new teams and will be traded back
for each other on December 13.

1933
In Philadelphia, Foxx ties a ML record with another HR, his 5th in 3 games
and his 12th of the year, but the A's bow to the Yankees, 7-6. Lou Gehrig
hits his 12th of the year and Tony Lazzeri hits a 3-run homer in the 8th
to ice it. The sweltering heat in the east (NYC sets a heat record for this
date with 97 degrees) causes both starters to end early; Jim Peterson leaves
after walking the leadoff batter and after 5 innings Jumbo Brown collapses
in the Yankees dugout and has to be carried away.

Luke Appling hits a HR in the 14th inning to give the White Sox a 10-9 win
over the Tigers.

1934
In the eighth inning of the Senators' 8-1 victory over the Red Sox, Boston
hurler Lefty Grove becomes the first pitcher in major league history to
yield six doubles in one frame (8th inning). The future Hall of Famer,
ailing from a sore arm, gives up a ML-record five consecutive two-baggers
during Washington's barrage.

1935
The Cardinals become the 10th team in history to score in every inning (8),
beating the Cubs 13-2 at St. Louis.

1936
Browns manager Rogers Hornsby makes his 2nd and last appearance of the
season as he replaces the injured Jim Bottomley at 1B. The Browns beat the
league-leading Yankees, 5-3, when The Rajah draws a walk to force in the
winning run and Beau Bell follows with another walk.

1937
Mickey Cochrane is taken off Detroit's active-player roster. 3B Marv Owen
is sidelined with a broken bone in his hand, and Rudy York is recalled from
Toledo to replace him.

Dizzy Dean outpitches Carl Hubbell as the Cards top the Giants, 8-1. The
2 will match up again on June 27.

1941
At Crosley Field, the Reds spot the Dodgers 4 runs after 7 innings, then
win 9-7 on Lonnie Frey's game-tying 2-run homer and game-winning 2-run double.

1945
Following an 8-7 win over the Phils, Brooklyn manager Leo Durocher is
arrested on a complaint by a fan that Durocher, allegedly using brass
knuckles, slugged him after an Ebbets Field cop hit him and broke his jaw,
then pinned back his arms. The fan, John Christian, had been loudly berating
the Dodgers and, after the 6th inning, the policeman was escorting the
fan beneath the stands when the incident occurred. The case will come to
trial next April and the all-male jury will take just 38 minutes to find
the policeman and Durocher not guilty. In a separate settlement of a civil
suit before the trial, Durocher paid Christian $6,750.

1946
Enroute to becoming the first team to draw two million fans at home, the
Yankees reach the one million mark at the earliest date in major league
history while drawing 66,545 for a doubleheader with the Indians. The Bronx
Bombers, the first team to attract one million patrons when 1,289,422 go
through the Polo Grounds turnstiles in 1920, will average 29,422 fans
this season, 14,000 more a game than for any previous season at Yankee
Stadium. Cleveland spoils the party with a 9-5 win in the opener, but the
Yankees salvage the nitecap, 7-4.

In a doubleheader loss in Pittsburgh 2-1 and 5-1, the usually mild mannered
Giants manager Mel Ott is thrown out of each game for protesting calls,
a major league first. Umps Dunn and Magerkurth do the tossing.

Boston sweeps two from Detroit, winning 7-1 and 11-6, to run their win streak
to 11 games. Joe Dobson and Mickey Harriss are the winning hurlers. Ted
Williams hits a homer in each game, including a 502-foot shot off Fred
Hutchinson that lands on a fan's straw hat in Section 42, Row 37, Seat 21 in
RF. The fan, Joseph A. Boucher, is later quoted, "How far away must one sit
to be safe in this park? They say it bounced a dozen rows higher. But after
it hit my head, I was no longer interested." The homerun will be commemorated
by having the seat (first, on the bleacher bench, then later on the seat)
painted red. This will remain the longest homerun hit at Fenway Park. Manny
Ramirez will knock one into the LF netting around the Coke bottle in June
of 2001 and it will "measure out" at 501 feet.

1947
Walker Cooper hits a 2-run HR in the 8th inning and a 3-run HR in the 9th to
help give the Giants a 13-10 win over Pittsburgh. Pinch hitter Sid Gordon
adds a single and double in the 8-run 8th inning. Kerr, Lohrke and Witak
also hit for the circuit. Larry Jansen pitches one inning for the win.

At Philadelphia, the Phils and Cards split a doubleheader, St. Louis taking
the opener 4-2 and losing the nightcap in 15 innings 2-1. Del Ennis drives in
the winner in the 15th. Schanz, the Phils' 5th pitcher is the winner. Starter
Schoolboy Rowe pitches 6 innings but leaves after being hit on the elbow
by a piece of flying wood from Stan Musial's broken bat. Red Schoendienst
sets a doubleheader record (24 innings) for futility by going 0 for 12.

At Boston, Red Barrett tosses a one hitter, winning 1-0 over the Cubs. Cubs
pitcher Hank Borowy has the only hit, a 6th inning single. Barrett hands
out one walk, his first in 3 games.

Good timing. The Reds' Benny Zientara belts his first ML homer - a 3-run
clout in the 8th - to beat the Dodgers, 9-6.

The 2nd place Yankees drop a 9-8 decision to the woeful White Sox. Allie
Reynolds issues 8 passes, and Bill Bevens adds 3 more. Joe Page walks none
in the 9th but Aaron Robinson lets a pop up drop in front of the plate for
a single, and two hits later, the Sox score the winner. Johnny Lindell and
Luke Appling match homers.

1949
The Phillies tip the Pirates 4-3 in 18 innings in Philadelphia. No Phillies
reach base via a walk in the game and each team has the same line:  68
at-bats; 16 hits; 21 assists and three errors.

Athletics P Dick Fowler records 9 putouts in a 12-inning 1-0 win over the
White Sox. Bill Wight allows just 6 hits, including 2 by 1B Chuck Kress,
acquired from the Reds yesterday. Luke Appling's 2-base error paves the
way for the winning run.

1950
Commissioner Happy Chandler orders the Cardinals to cancel their Sunday
night game with the Dodgers. On the advice of NL President Ford Frick,
the Cards comply and reschedule it as a July 17th day/night doubleheader.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

Ernie Banks hits 100th career homerun helping the Chicago Cubs beat the
Philadelphia Phillies, 7-3.

1952
A week after being traded from the Red Sox, Don Lenhardt hits another grand
slam and drives home 5 but Detroit loses to Boston, 9-8. Dropo and Piersall
homer for the Hubmen.

1953
The refusal of the NL owners to allow the Pirates to remove Greenberg Gardens
after the trade of Ralph Kiner proves a boon to the Bucs in their 7-4 win over
the Cards. Eddie Pellagrini belts a 3-run pinch HR into the shortened gardens
in the 8th, and P Dick Hall lofts a solo shot in the 4th into the same spot.

1954
Cards P Harvey Haddix defeats the Dodgers 3-0, the first lefty to shut them
out since 1950. The Dodgers drop into a tie with the Giants for 1st place.

In the 2nd game of two against the Phils, Cubs Joe Garagiola and Bill
Serena each hit pinch homers, but it is not enough as the Phils win 14-6
for a sweep of the doubleheader.

At Cincinnati, the Reds hit 4 solo HRs, one by winning pitcher Joe Nuxhall,
to top Max Surkont and the Pirates 4-3. Greengrass hits one while Gus Bell
rings twice.

1955
The Redlegs trade OF Bob Borkowski and cash to the Dodgers for 1952 Rookie
of the Year pitcher Joe Black.

1959
Joan Payson, a wealthy investor, is identified as the principal backer of
a New York franchise in the proposed 3rd league.

At the Stadium, the Yanks edge Kansas City, 9-8 in 13 innings. Mantle homers
in the 4th, off Murry Dickson, but it is Hector Lopez' single that wins it
in the 13th.

1960
George Strickland's 2-run homer in the 6th is the winning margin in
Cleveland's 3-2 win over the Red Sox. With the Orioles losing a pair to
Detroit, Cleveland stretches its AL lead to 1 1/2 games. After the game,
the Red Sox send outfielder Gene Stephens to the Orioles for OF Willie Tasby.

1961
Ryne Duren sets an AL record with 7 straight strikeouts against the Red
Sox. He fans 11 batters in a 5-1 win for the Angels.

In a rain-interrupted game in New York, Mantle's 3-run homer in the 3rd
is the difference in an 8-6 win over Kansas City. Maris also homers, the
third time this year the two have gone deep in the same game.

1963
In the first major league game ever played on a Sunday night, the Colt 45's
extend the Giants' losing streak to seven games blanking the visiting team,
3-0. Due to the extreme heat during the days of the Texan summer months,
baseball grants permission for games to be played in the evening at Colt
Stadium.

Catcher Tim McCarver of the Cards hits an inside-the-park grand slam against
the Mets to give St. Louis an 8-7 win.

The Phils score 5 runs in the 9th inning on homers by Don Demeter, Jim Lemon
and Johnny Callison to tie the Reds, 7-7. Philadelphia scores again in the
10th inning to win 8-7.

Ernie Banks bangs solo homers off Sandy Koufax, in the 2nd and the 5th at
Wrigley, and the Cubs kayo the ace with 6 earned runs in 5 2/3 innings. But
Sandy gets no decision as the Dodgers outslug the Cubs, 11-8. Larry Sherry is
the winner over Cubs ace Dick Ellsworth, who has his worst outing of the year.

1966
Trailing 4-3 in the bottom of the seventh at Metropolitan Stadium, the Twins
erupt for the first five-homerun inning in American League history. Rich
Rollins, Zoilo Versalles (off Catfish Hunter), Tony Oliva, Don Mincher
(off Paul Lindblad) and Harmon Killebrew (off John Wyatt) all go deep to
give the Twins a 9-4 victory over the A's.

1967
Cal Ermer, who played only one game in the majors, replaces Sam Mele (25-25)
as manager of the Twins. The Twins are in 6th place.

At Fenway, Yaz earns standing ovations as he makes 2 great catches and
poles 2 HRs in the Red Sox' 8-7 win over the Senators.

1968
Unlike its decision in April to delay the start of the season after Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr was assassinated in Memphis, Major League Baseball lets
individual teams decide if they will postpone games when Robert F. Kennedy
is killed two months later by an assassin's bullet. When Houston decides
to continue playing their scheduled home contests, Rusty Staub and Bob
Aspromonte, both who will be traded at the end of the season, protest by
benching themselves in today's 3-1 loss to Pittsburgh at the Astrodome.

1969
After President Johnson declares this a national day of mourning in memory
of the assassinated Robert Kennedy, the Reds' players threaten to boycott
today's doubleheader with the Cardinals. Led by Milt Pappas and Vada Pinson,
the team, by a slim majority, votes not to play. A very upset GM Bob Howsam
and manager David Bristol call for 9 volunteers to play. Pete Rose, Tommy
Helms and Jim Maloney leave the clubhouse and shortly afterwards the rest
of the team follows. The Reds take an 8-0 lead after 4 innings before the
Birds lay 10 runs in the 5th to complete the scoring. It's a reverse in
the nitecap as the Cards take a 6-1 lead, and the Reds score 5 in the 5th
to tie, and once in the 12th inning to win, 7-6.

Mickey Lolich's 16 strikeouts in 9 innings ties the Detroit record he set May
23rd, but the Tigers drop a 3-2 10-inning decision to Seattle. Pat Dobson
is the loser. The only run off Lolich is a leadoff HR by Dick Simpson on
the first pitch of the game.

1970
Detroit's Willie Horton clubs 3 HRs, including a grand slam, knocking in
7 runs in an 8-3 win over Milwaukee.

1971
Expo Steve Renko pitches the first of 2 one-hitters of the season. He beats
the Giants 4-0 exactly a month before he will top the Phillies 3-0. Dick
Dietz' single is the only hit.

1973
Rightfielder Rusty Staub becomes the pivot man in a very unusual double
play during a 4-2 Mets victory against the Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Racing
in from the outfield, the 'Le Grand Orange' gets a throw near second base
from first baseman John Milner and tags Davey Lopes, who was picked-off
from first and then throws home to nail Tom Paciorek trying to score from
second during the P-1B-SS-1B-2B-1B-2B-RF-C rundown.

The Mets retire Gil Hodges' number 14 in tribute to their late manager, who
died of a heart attack just prior to the start of the season. In addition
to leading his underdog club to a World Championship in 1969, the quiet
leader also hit the first homerun in franchise history, a 1962 solo shot
at Busch Stadium off St. Louis right-hander Larry Jackson.

At KC, the Yankees rally for 5 runs in the 9th to stop the Royals,
6-4. Newcomer Pat Dobson pitches 5 innings and allows one hit to win in
relief. New York moves into first with the win.

After the old timers' game at Shea, Willie Mays puts on his own show
with a homer and circus catch and the Mets top the Dodgers, 4-2. Willie,
older than a half dozen of the old Mets, hits #655 of his career. Rusty
Staub drives in two runs to back Jon Matlack. In the old timers' game,
the Brooklyn Dodgers/Yankees lose to the Mets, 1-0, in two innings.

At Wrigley, the Reds turn a 4-1 deficit into an 8-4 win over the Cubs,
by scoring 7 runs in the 9th inning. Dan Driessen, in his ML debut, has a
double and walk in the 9th.

1974
Ritchie Zisk of Pittsburgh hits for the cycle and the Pirates roll over
the Giants, 14-1. Jerry Reuss is the winner.

1975
The Dodgers beat the Expos, 4-0, and go over the one million mark in home
attendance in only their 27th date. This breaks the ML record of 28 days
set by the 1948 Indians.

In a 12-4 loss to Texas at Fenway, Yaz hits his 500th double. Jackie Brown
is the wining pitcher.

1979
Nolan Ryan strikes out 16 batters in a 4-hit 9-1 Angels victory over
the Tigers.

Tom Seaver fires a 3-hitter, retiring the last 24 batters, in the Reds'
7-1 win over the Expos. As noted by Rhodes and Snyder in their Reds history,
Dave Concepcion hits a red seat homer off Bill Lee.

Charlie Manuel, playing for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, is critically injured
when a brushback pitch fractures his jaw in 7 places. Hitting .371 with 24
HRs and 60 RBI at the time, Manuel will earn the respect of the fans for
his determined comeback effort.

1980
At Cincinnati, three rain delays and a 4-run 9th for the Reds adds up to
a 6-6 tie with the Padres. The game is called at 2:30 a.m.

1982
Steve Carlton strikes out 16 while handing the Cubs their 10th consecutive
loss, 4-2. Carlton is now 7-6 after an 0-4 start.

1984
Greg Luzinski becomes the 10th player in ML history to hit grand slams in
consecutive games when he connects off the Twins' Mike Walters in the 7th
inning of an 8-4 White Sox victory. The previous day, Luzinski sparked the
Sox to a 6-1 win with a first-inning grand slam off Frank Viola.

Pete O'Brien's bizarre sacrifice fly gives Texas a 4-3 12-inning win over
Oakland. With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the 12th, A's left
fielder Garry Hancock catches O'Brien's deep fly ball, then intentionally
drops it when he realizes he is in foul territory. The umpires rule that
the catch had been made, however, and Wayne Tolleson trots home from 3B
