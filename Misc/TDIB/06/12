record. The Browns collect 9 hits including 2 homers off Bullet Joe Bush -
a 2-run homer in the 1st by Williams and a solo by John Tobin - in pinning

8-7. Cleveland scores 7 in the first 2 innings to rout Waite Hoyt. His
replacement, George Pipgras, homers and pitches well. It is Joe Hornung
Day at the Stadium, as the veteran from the 1880s celebrates his 72nd
birthday. He receives a testimonial and money from his friends.

For the 2nd day in a row, Brooklyn and Pittsburgh play an 11-10 game,
with the Pirates losing again, but this time at Brooklyn. Reliever Norm
Petty wins the game with a single in the 8th, while Paul Waner collects
another 3 hits for the Bucs. The Robins are in the midst of a 7-game streak
of one-run games, which will conclude on June 15. The seven one-run games
ties a NL mark of the 1920 Cardinals and 1910 Giants. The Reds in 1967 will
reel off 11 one-run games in a row.

University where he receives his diploma. After graduation, Schumacher
pitches the first 2 innings in a game against his old college teammates. He
gives up one hit, as the Giants win 12-4.

1935
After manager Grimm blasts the team in a pre-game clubhouse meeting - and bans
poker games, the Cubs go out and throw a full house at the Phillies, winning
15-0. Larry French is the winner as Cavarretta has 3 hits, including a HR and
4 RBIs, and Chuck Klein adds a 3-run homer. The Cubs lose the nitecap, 11-8.

in game 1. Foxx has a homer in each game.

1938
The A's beat the Browns 8-3, as Bob Johnson bats in all the runs with 3 HRs,
one a grand slam, and a single. This tied a ML mark set by George Kelly in
1924. It's Johnson's 2nd grand slam this month. Before today's performance,
Johnson had hit 8 homers in his last 14 games, and had gone 7 for 9 in the
first two games of the series with St. Louis. By knocking in all 8 runs
for his team, "Indian Bob" ties a ML record of George Kelly (1924). Buck
Ross is the winning pitcher.

The Yankees spot the Indians six runs, then score 7 runs in the 6th inning
to win, 7-6.

The Senators jump in front of the Tigers, 11-1, a seemingly insurmountable
lead with Wes Ferrell on the mound. But after a long rain delay, Gehringer

The greatest gathering of members and future inductees of the Baseball
Hall of Fame assembles in Cooperstown, NY, for the dedication of the
museum. Much of its funding was provided by the Clark Foundation, a
charitable organization established by the Singer Sewing Machine Company.
The shrine's location was determined due an erroneous report made by the
Mills Commission in 1905 that claimed US Civil War Hero Abner Doubleday
invented baseball in the small town in upstate New York. A 6-inning game
at Doubleday Field showcases lineups studded with players who will be
elected in the future. Honus Wagner's lineup defeats Eddie Collins' squad,
4-2. Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Walter Johnson, Grover Alexander,
Nap Lajoie, George Sisler, Eddie Collins, Tris Speaker, Cy Young and Connie
Mack accept their plaques. Cobb, angry at Commissioner Landis, shows up
after the ceremony and photo-taking to accept his plaque. Other inductees,
all deceased, include Cap Anson, Charles Comiskey, Candy Cummings, Buck
Ewing, Hoss Radbourn, Al Spalding and Wee Willie Keeler.

1940

obtains Ducky Medwick (batting .338) and pitcher Curt Davis (22-game winner
last season) from the Cardinals for outfielder Ernie Koy, pitcher Carl Doyle,
minor leaguers Bert Haas and Sam Nahem, and $125,000. The deal signals the
emergence of Brooklyn as a serious contender.

The first place Red Sox club veteran Indian P Mel Harder for a 9-5 win,
handing the Tribe their 8th loss in 13 games. Cleveland's Ossie Vitt,
in lifting Harder, snarls, "It's about time you won one, the money you're
making." The criticism, plus the same type of remarks made earlier about
Feller, will prompt Harder to request a meeting with Cleveland owner Alva
Bradley tomorrow morning in Cleveland.

1941
A month after joining them, the Braves break up the Waner brothers sending
Lloyd (.412), known as 'Little Poison', to the Reds for pitcher Johnny
Hutchings. 'Big Poison' Paul, the older sibling will stay in Boston.

Babe Phelps, who skipped spring training, misses the Dodger train to
St. Louis and returns to New York claiming he's "ill." A furious Durocher

to Maryland and will not play the rest of the season.

1943
In a 14-5 New York win over the A's, Roy Weatherly of the Yankees, who

in the 7th makes his 5th theft of home this season.

hitting a two-run homer in the first game, and belting two more round-trippers
in the nitecap. Allie Reynolds and Spec Shea take the losses.

At St. Louis, the Giants overcome the Cards, 7-5, by scoring five runs
in the 7th, and regaining first place. The Cards make 13 hits and rout
Larry Jansen, but John Mize, with a homer, double and single, leads the
New Yorkers. Sheldon Jones is brilliant in relief.

1949
The Cubs (19-31) split a doubleheader with the Braves, winning the opener 6-2,
then losing 2-0, to teenager Johnny Antonelli. 39-year-old Dutch Leonard is
the loser to the 19-year-old bonus chucker. After managing the Braves for 13
seasons, Charlie Grimm ends his tenure as by splitting a doubleheader with the
Cubs. The 19,802 fans in attendance at Braves Field give the skipper, who will
stay in the organization as Boston's vice-president, a long standing ovation
as he takes up his position in the third base coaching box for the last time.

Red hot Andy Seminick clubs 3 homers to help the Phils split a pair with
the Cards. Seminick is 7 for 8 in the 2 games and in the middle of a streak
that will produce 9 homers and 25 RBIs in 14 games.

The Dodgers run roughshod over the Reds, winning 20-7. Brooklyn's Gil Hodges

an average of more than six batters a game. The Tribe proceeds to win their
next 9 games.

Jim Wilson, 32, no-hits the Phillies 2-0 before 28,218 in Milwaukee. Future
Hall of Famer Robin Roberts takes the loss, his first after 9 straight
wins over the Braves. It is Wilson's first start after pitching just 8 2/3
innings of relief, giving up 7 runs. Ironically, the Braves asked waivers
on Wilson 2 weeks earlier, with no takers. Today's one-hour forty-three
minute contest will be the major league's only hitless game this season.

1959
Despite giving up a hit in the bottom of the sixth in the Giants' 3-0 victory
over Philadelphia, Mike McCormick is credited with a no-hitter when the
game is rained out and the inning is never completed statistically erasing
the hit. The right-hander's five-inning rain-shortened no-no will be taken
out of the record book due to a rule change in 1991 that mandates a game
must last for at least nine innings for the hitless effort to be called an
official no-hitter.

nitecap for Detroit and winning pitcher Frank Lary also goes deep.

hit HRs in the same game for the first time. They'll do it twice more this
year. Hank has three hits and drives in three runs before retiring in the

history. Washington wins 6-5 when Paul Casanova, who has caught the entire
game, singles in the winning run in the bottom of the 22nd. The Nats lose
Bernie Allen for 10 days when he fractures his thumb in a collision in
the 17th inning. The game ends at 2:43 in the morning causing the American
League to adopt a curfew stating that no inning may begin after 1:00 a.m.

Bertaina in the 6th, and visiting New York wins, 2-0.

as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 1-0. It is Briggs' first homer of the year.

1970
Doc Ellis throws a 2-0 no-hitter against the Padres in San Diego during

After beating Oklahoma State in the CWS opener, 1-0, while striking out 14,
Minnesota's Dave Winfield makes his final start as a pitcher, facing 3-time
defending champ Southern Cal. Through 8 innings Winfield allows an infield
single while striking out 15 as the Gophers take a 7-0 lead. After a single
and a FC, which results in coach Dick Siebert being ejected, Winfield gives

asked to come back in. But Gordon Peterson pitches instead and gives up 2
runs as the Trojans come back with an incredible 8-7 win.

Stadium. The highlight of the double-digit deluge is Doug Flynn's three-run
inside-the-park homerun. The 15 runs in the 6th is a NL record.

1980
Mike Easler hits for the cycle to lead Pittsburgh to a 10-6 win over

triple, including the game winner for Rick Langford.

1983

Before the game against the Giants, Dale Murphy visits with a six-year old in
the stands who recently lost both arms and a leg due a power line accident

In the first complete game of his career in which he does not walk at least
one batter, Nolan Ryan strikes out 11 Padres in a 2-0 shutout to move back
