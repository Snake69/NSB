1902
At least he keeps the score in single digits. Jim Jones, Giants LF, throws
3 base runners out at home in an 8-0 loss to Boston. His three assists ties
the ML record set by Dummy Hoy on June 19, 1889. It'll be tied again in 1905.

Cleveland is the first AL team to hit 3 consecutive HRs in one inning as
Nap Lajoie, Piano Legs Hickman and Bill Bradley connect in the sixth off
St. Louis, with all the hits ending in the LF bleachers. The last 2 come
on the first pitch thrown. Jack Harper tees up the gopher balls in the
17-2 loss. It was last done on May 10, 1894. Game 2 ends in a 3-3 tie in
15 innings. Neither team scores after the 8th.

1903
The Cards bunch 3 hits and a George Davis error in the 6th for 3 runs and
beat Christy Mathewson, 4-2. Davis will appear in just 4 games in 1903,
all for the Giants, before White Sox owner Charles Comiskey secures an
injunction to keep him off the field. He'll be back with the Sox next season.

At Chicago, the White Sox jump on Boston starter Nick Altrock for 8 runs in
the 1st inning. Chicago has 7 hits and 3 walks. Altrock finishes the game,
a 10-3 Chicago win, for his only complete game in a Boston uniform. Chicago
must like what they see:  they purchase Altrock on July 2nd.

1904
Mathewson blanks Boston, 3-0, despite allowing 8 hits. The Giants have now
won 14 in a row.

1905
Nap Lajoie is sidelined by blood poisoning from neglect of a spike wound. He
will play in only 65 games, losing a chance to lead the AL in batting for
the 5th straight year.

At New York, Eddie Plank is removed with no outs in the 9th inning and the
A's leading 7-4. Rube Waddell comes in and retires the side to preserve
the A's victory.

1906
At the Polo Grounds, the Beaneaters score 4 runs in 7 innings off Mathewson
to beat the Giants 4-3.

1908
Cy Young's 3rd career no-hitter is an 8-0 Boston win over host New York. Cy
almost duplicates his perfect game of 1904, walking just one batter -
leadoff hitter Harry Niles. Niles is then caught stealing and the next 26
batters make out. Cy also tallies 3 hits and drives in half the Americans'
runs off Rube Manning. At 41 years and 3 months, he is the oldest pitcher
to turn the no-hit trick. Nolan Ryan will beat him in 1990 at the age of
43. Young had a near-perfect game exactly a month ago.

1909
Chicago's Ed Reulbach spoils Pittsburgh's dedication of Forbes Field before
30,338, allowing 3 hits and beating Vic Willis, 3-2. A parade of old-time
players precedes the game. The Pirates will draw 98,000 fans, including 41,000
on July 5, in their first five home games. The new state-of-the-art ballpark,
named for General John Forbes who was an officer in the French and Indian
War, is the first stadium to be made completely of steel and poured concrete.

At Washington Park, the Superbas gaff the Giants, 7-2 beating Hooks Wiltse in
the opener. The Giants come back in the nitecap, 3-0, behind Mathewson. Matty
strikes out 9 and allows 4 hits.

1911
Brooklyn's Baron Knetzer lords it over Grover Alexander, handing Pete and
the Phils a 5-0 shutout. Alexander's record is now 15-3 and the Phils are
tied for 2nd with the Cubs, two games behind New York.

At St. Louis, the Cards hand the Pirates a 5-3 defeat. St. Louis 2B Miller
Huggins puts the capper on the win by nabbing Max Carey in the 9th inning
with a hidden ball trick.

1912
In game 2 of a DH at St Louis, Joe Jackson ties the ML record with 3 triples
to pace Cleveland to a 15-1 pasting of the Browns. The Browns take the
opener, 6-4.

1914
Cleveland's Terry Turner ends a long dry spell by hitting a three-run
homer off the Browns' Earl Hamilton. Turner's last HR was back in 1906.
He had gone 3186 at-bats without a round tripper.

1917
Pirates manager Jimmy Callahan is fired after his team goes 20-40. Popular
star Honus Wagner is named field manager with Hugo Bezdek to take over the
team's business affairs. As his first order of business, Wagner guides to
Bucs to a 5-4 win over the Reds, contributing a 2-run double as well.

The Tigers split with the host Browns, losing the opener before winning,
5-3. Cobb warms up in the first game with 2 hits, then clocks an opposite
field grand slam and a triple in the 2nd game. The slam clears the LF
bleachers.

1918
In the 10th inning in Washington, Babe Ruth, playing CF, hits his 11th HR to
beat Walter Johnson, 3-1, and boost the Red Sox back into first place. Ruth
also cracked a HR off Johnson on May 7, the only homeruns the Washington ace
gives up between September of 1917 and May of 1920. Carl Mays is the winner,
striking out 6, while Johnson K's one. Ruth will hit no more homers this
year, but his 11 - in just 95 games - will be good enough to share the ML
lead with the A's Tilly Walker.

The Reds slow the Cubs' pennant drive in Cincinnati by taking the first game
of a doubleheader, 7-0, behind Jimmy Ring. Cincy gets all the runs it needs
when Cubs starter Claude Hendrix walks four of the first 5 batters. The
nitecap ends in a 7-7 tie, called at 7 o'clock by prior agreement to allow
the Cubs to catch a train for St. Louis.

Detroit takes a pair from Cleveland, winning 10-2 and 2-0. Ty Cobb is 7 for
9 in the two games. Tris Speaker helps the Bengals in game one with 3 errors.

In Washington, Ty Cobb's brother starts a 4-run 9th inning rally as the
Quantico Marines beat Army Operations, 6-5, at Georgetown Field.

Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Steele allows just one hit against his former
teammates, but his wild throw in the 4th inning accounts for two runs,
and the Cardinals win, 2-1. Red Ames is the victor while Jeff Heathcote's
double is the only St. Louis hit. Pittsburgh takes the nitecap, 5-4, scoring
the winning run on a triple by Buster Caton and double by Carson Bigbee in
the 11th inning. Starter Wilber Cooper goes all the way for the victory.

In London, Red Cross workers complete work on 800 baseball uniforms to be
sent to American camps around Great Britain. The uniforms are completed in
time for July 4th games.

1919
The Yanks sweep two from the Red Sox, winning 7-4 in the opener behind Bob
Shawkey. Boston gets all its runs on a 6th inning grand slam by 1B Babe
Ruth. New York takes the 2nd game, 4-2.

1920
Cubs ace Hippo Vaughn stops the Pirates on one hit to beat Elmer Ponder,
1-0. Possum Whitted has the lone hit.

The White Sox swamp the Tigers, 14-0, on 18 hits. Detroit tosses in the
towel after 4 innings and pitching coach Jack Coombs, who last toed a rubber
two years ago, tosses the last five innings. He allows just 2 runs. Red
Faber allows five hits in the shut out, while Eddie Collins has four hits,
three runs and two steals.

1921
Detroit drives Jim Bagby from the mound and beats Cleveland, 6-3. But Ty
Cobb spikes himself in the left knee sliding into 2B and will be sidelined
for two weeks.

1922
Brooklyn and Boston play 9 innings in 1 hour 12 minutes, with Boston winning
3-2. Neither pitcher, Leon Cadore or Dana Fillingim, record a strikeout or
walk a man, and neither catcher, DeBerry and Gowdy, have a putout or assist,
though each have passed balls.

1923
Led by Jimmy Johnston, Brooklyn splits a pair with the Phils, winning 10-4
before losing 6-2. Johnston makes an out his first time up, then goes 4 for
4 with a walk in game 1 and follows it with a 4 for 4 performance in game 2
to finish with a remarkable hitting and on base streak (as noted by Trent
McCotter). He is the first player since Sam Thompson in 1895 to record 3
or more hits in six straight games (George Brett will do it in 1976). He
has the most hits in 5 games (19) and 6 games (23) since Cal McVey in
1876. His 25 times on base for 30 plate appearances will be topped only
by Barry Bonds. And he has the most times on base in 4, 5, 6 and 7 games
since Billy Hamilton in 1894.

1924
2B Max Bishop and 3B Sammy Hale, the first 2 men in the A's batting order,
draw 8 of the 9 walks issued by New York pitchers in the A's 10-3 win. A .271
hitter for 12 years, "Camera Eye" Bishop will draw 1,153 bases on balls,
giving him a walk percentage of .204, which is higher than Ruth's and just
behind Ted Williams' .207.

The White Sox defeat the Tigers, 14-4, as Johnny Mostil scores 5 runs.

1925
Walter Johnson blanks the A's, 7-0, allowing just 2 scratch singles and no
walks, to knock the A's out of the lead. The A's take just one of 5 games
in the series. Philadelphia drops out of 1st place for the first time since
May 7th, but will soon be back on top.

1926
With player-manager Ty Cobb coaching 3B, base runner Harry Heilmann falls
for the hidden ball trick pulled by Browns 3B Marty McManus. The Tigers
still win 4-1.

1927
Alphonse "Tommy" Thomas pitches a 5-1 win over the Browns, the 6th time this
season that the White Sox pitcher has beaten St. Louis. He last beat them
on June 22. Lefty Stewart, who gives up a homer to Earl Sheely in the 6th,
takes the loss.

Pirates SS Glenn Wright, heading home from St. Louis after a beaning in a
game with the Cards, is slightly injured when the train he is riding is
wrecked near Dennison, Ohio. Pitcher Lee Meadows, accompanying Wright,
is also shook up.

A crowd of 3,000 at Yankee Stadium sees the Yanks hand the Red Sox their
12th straight loss, beating the visitors, 13-6, on 19 safeties. Gehrig takes
over the homerun lead when he clouts his 25th in the first inning, a bounce
homerun off Slim Harriss, but Babe Ruth, back in the lineup, golfs his 25th
in the 4th, also off Slim. Gehrig has 3 hits and also swipes home. New York
(49-20) wins its 5th straight.

The Tigers edge the Indians, 6-5, beating George Uhle for the 5th time
this year.

1928
At Boston, the Yankees win 2 from the Red Sox, 11-4 and 7-6, and close out
the month 11 1/2 games in front of the A's. Attendance lags, as the race
appears over.

1930
Brooklyn, in need of an OF, buys Ike Boone from the San Francisco Missions
(PCL) where he was hitting .448 through 83 games. In 1929 Boone compiled
an all-time record of 553 total bases while hitting 55 homers and batting
.407. Boone wasn't even Brooklyn's first choice; the Robins preferred another
PCL batting star, Buzz Arlett, but he had his eye injured in a postgame
fight when umpire Chet Chadbourne slugged the Oakland OF with his mask.

The Cubs move into first place ahead of Brooklyn by defeating the Giants,
10-3, at home. Sheriff Blake beats Joe Genewich for the victory.

1931
The Cubs roll over the Phillies, 14-3, as Rogers Hornsby clouts a grand
slam off the loser, Clise Dudley. Pat Malone is the winner.

At the Polo Grounds, St. Louis infielder Sparky Adams leads off with a
homerun, his first four bagger since 1925. He had been at-bat 3,104 times
since without a homer. Adams adds a double and Frisch has a HR and 2 singles
to drive in 4 runs. New York's Ethan Allen answers with a 5th-inning pinch
grand slam, off Paul Derringer, to tie the game. But the Cards hold on for
an 11-10 win.

1932
At Philadelphia, the Phils top Brooklyn, 9-3, behind Chuck Klein's 23rd
and 24th homers of the season. Klein finishes June with more homers than
any NL hitter has racked up in that time.

At Wrigley, the Cubs take the field wearing numbers on their uniforms, the
last team in the majors to do so. The numbers follow the lineup and SS Woodie
English sports #1. Guy Bush, #14, has the Reds' number, tossing a 7-0 shutout.

1934
Gehrig plays and has 3 triples at Washington. However, the game is rained
out after 4 1/2 innings, depriving Gehrig of a record.

Led by pinch hitter Harlan Pool's 2 hits and 2 runs in one inning, the Reds
drop 9 runs on the visiting Cardinals in the 8th inning and win, 11-4.

In a 4-3, 10-inning loss to the Browns, Tiger CF Gee Walker is picked
off base twice on the same play, earning him a 10-day suspension for his
ineptitude. After Hank Greenberg singles, Walker reaches base on an error,
but then gets caught off base when C Rollie Hemsley fires to 1B. Greenberg
attempts to draw a throw by running to 3B and is thrown out, with Walker
taking 2B. Moments later, with Walker standing 6 feet off the bag "as brave
as a boy on a burning deck" (writer Charles P. Ward's description), pitcher
Jack Knott's throw to SS Alan Strange nabs him. Cochrane is so furious he
suspends Walker and fines him $20 - the 6th time this season that he has
earned a $20 fine. Gee's next appearance won't come until July 16 when he
pinch hits for Cochrane.

On the 25th anniversary of Forbes Field, a granite monument to Barney
Dreyfuss is unveiled to the left of the exit gate before the start of the
Cubs-Pirates match. The Windy City squad wins, 4-2, behind Bill Lee, the
8th straight win for the Cubs.

1935
At St. Louis, leadoff hitter Pete Fox leads the Tigers to a twinbill drubbing
of the Browns, as Detroit rolls 18-1 and 11-6. Fox drives in 10 runs, 6 in
the opener when he hits his 2nd grand slam of the month. Fox has 8 hits,
5 in the nitecap, and scores 4 runs in each game. Rowe coasts in the opener
and Alvin Crowder is the nitecap winner.

At Boston, the Phils unload on the Braves winning, 15-5, to give Syl Johnson
his 8th straight win.

1937
Lefty Gomez has his no-hit bid spoiled by a 5th inning homerun by the A's
Bob Johnson, but Gomez finishes with a 5-1 one-hit victory. The Yanks now
lead the AL by four games.

Wes Ferrell and the Senators top the Red Sox and Bobo Newsom, 6-4. In the
first meeting since the two righties swapped uniforms three weeks ago,
Ferrell drives in the tying and winning runs in the 8th with the bases
loaded. Jimmy Foxx has a homer for Boston, while Cecil Travis has a single
and a pair of triples for the Nats. A Washington crowd of 22,000 is on hand
for the prearranged match between the 2 pitchers.

1938
The Phillies play their final game in the Baker Bowl, losing 14-1 to the
Giants. They will play future games in A's-owned Shibe Park. Hank Lieber
hits the last homer in the park, while Slick Castleman is the last winning
pitcher in the 51-year-old park.

1941
The Browns score 9 runs in the 7th to drive Bob Feller out of the box and
beat the Indians, 12-6. Joe Grace has a double and homer in the big inning.

The Giants score 3 runs in the 12th to break up a scoreless pitching duel
between the Braves' Manuel Salvo and New York's Cliff Melton. Salvo loses
his 10th in a row.

Pete Reiser triples on the 1st pitch of the game and the next time up hits
the 1st pitch for a HR as the Dodgers whip the Phillies, 9-2. Whit Wyatt
wins his 12th, allowing 6 hits. The win gives the Dodgers a first-place
tie with the Cards.

1947
At Cincinnati, Ewell Blackwell strikes out 11 Cubs enroute to a 6-4
win. Blackwell has now won 10 in a row.

1948
In his first full season as a pitcher, Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians
pitches a no-hitter, beating the Detroit Tigers, 2-0, in front of 49,628 at
Briggs Stadium. Lemon has only two scares:  Dale Mitchell makes a miraculous
catch of a George Kell drive in the 4th and Ken Keltner makes a great
stop behind 3B in the 5th. This is the first no-hitter pitched at night.
The Tigers' home was the last park in the Junior Circuit to use lights,
installing illumination only two weeks ago.

An 18-year-old lefthander from Rochester, NY, Johnny Antonelli, gets a
$75,000 contract from the Braves. Shortly afterward, the Tigers will pay
a similar sum to another teenager, catcher Frank House.

1949
DiMaggio's 4th HR in 3 games, a 3-run shot off the LF light tower, gives
the Yankees a 6-3 win, and a sweep of 5th place Boston. Vic Raschi (12-2)
picks up the win over Mel Parnell (10-4). The Yanks leave Boston with a 5
1/2 game lead over the A's.

Behind Hank Edwards' offense, the Cubs down the Cardinals, 11-2. Edwards
has 2 homers, 4 RBIs and scores 5 runs.

At the Polo Grounds, the Braves take 2 from the Giants, 3-0 and 6-2. In the
twi-nite game, Alvin Dark and Bob Elliott have inside-the-park-homers for
Boston. Lockman's muff of a fly ball with the sacks full allows 2 runs to
score. Bill Voiselle wins the opener and Glenn Elliott the nitecap.

In a National Girls Baseball League doubleheader in Chicago, Josephine Severs
sets league marks with 7 RBIs in game 1, 11 RBIs for the doubleheader, while
going 7 for 9 with 13 total bases, also a league mark for a doubleheader. Her
Bloomer Girls beat the Cardinals, 13-2 and 10-3.

In Chicago, Ruth Ann Steinhagen is arraigned for shooting Eddie
Waitkus. Waitkus, in a wheel chair, testifies at the hearing. A jury finds
her criminally insane and by early afternoon she is on her way to Kankakee
State mental hospital. She'll remain there till April 17, 1952.

1950
Joe and Dom DiMaggio both HR in the 10-2 Red Sox victory over New York in
the nightcap of a doubleheader. It has been 15 years since two brothers
homered in an American League game.

Brownie stalwart P Ned Garver loses the game because of his mental error
against the White Sox. In what would have been the winning run in regulation,
Garver is called out for his failure to touch 3B when rounding it. He loses
3-2 in 13 innings.

At the Polo Grounds, the Braves' Sibby Sisti hits a pinch grand slam to
provide the win as Boston is victorious over New York, 8-4.

1951
The Braves make it easy for new manager Tommy Holmes' first appearance
in front of the home crowd. Boston tallies 8 runs in the 7th inning and 7
runs in the 8th inning, to squash the Giants 19-7. Backing Vern Bickford's
pitching, Earl Torgeson racks up 7 RBIs in the 2 innings, including a grand
slam off Sal Maglie, the first time the Barber's been clipped for a slam.

1952
Satchel Paige is named to the All-Star team.

1953
Braves slugger Eddie Mathews has 5 straight hits in a 10-inning 6-4 win
over the Redlegs.

At New York, the Pirates get a leadoff inside-the-park homer from Cal
Abrams and go on to beat the Giants, 3-1. Murry Dickson wins the 6-hitter
over Preston Gomez.

1954
Tom Morgan of the Yankees hits 3 Red Sox - Billy Goodman (hand), Milt Bolling
(back) and Ted Lepcio (hand) - in the 3rd inning of a 6-1 loss. Mickey
Mantle's opposite field HR against Willard Nixon is the only Yankee
tally. Nixon beat the Yanks a month ago, giving up just a solo homer
to Mantle.

1955
At Washington, Joe Cronin declares his Red Sox are only playing today because
it is a Red Cross benefit game. In deference to the Sox, the Senators move
the game's start time from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. so it does not coincide with
the burial of Harry Agganis in Lynn, Massachusetts. Also, the Sox players
don't participate in the pre-game antics such as the egg-tossing contest,
the phantom infield practice and the blindfolded wheelbarrow race, won by
Camilo Pascual. Finishing off the day is a post-game dressage exhibition
by Arthur Godfrey:  his horse spends the game grazing by the vistors'
bullpen. After a 15-minute tribute to Agganis, the Senators beat the Red
Sox, 3-2. Frank Shea, who sung "You Gotta Have Heart," from "Damn Yankees,"
with Mickey McDermott before the game (Shea only sang the "heart") strikes
out Norm Zauchin with the bases loaded to end the game.

The Dodgers come back three times to beat the Giants, 6-5. On the front end
of a double steal with Dusty Rhodes in the 7th, Wayne Terwilliger scores to
put New York up, 3-2. Brooklyn scores in the 9th to tie it up. Mays hits a
2-run homer in the 10th and Brooklyn again comes back to tie, Durocher uses
4 pitchers to pitch to 4 batters in the 11th but Brooklyn scores to win,
6-5. The Dodgers press Dixie Howell into service when Rube Walker is injured
in the 8th in a collision with Mays. Campanella is out with a knee injury.

1957
The Braves sweep a doubleheader from Pittsburgh, 7-4 and 6-5, to take a
1/2 game lead over the 2nd-place Reds.

1958
In a 7-6 win against the A's, the Tigers execute a triple steal in the
2nd inning with Billy Martin on the front end of Red Wilson and Frank
Bolling. Martin did the same last year with the Yankees. Martin later gets
picked off 2B.

1959
At Wrigley, a bizarre play occurs in the 4th inning when two balls are put
into play. On a 3-1 count, Bob Anderson's pitch to Stan Musial is wild and
bounces back to the screen. Catcher Sammy Taylor ignores the ball, assuming
it ticked off Musial's bat, but Cubs 3B Alvin Dark rushes in to retrieve
the wild pitch/foul tip. The bat boy tosses the ball to field announcer
Pat Piper, and Dark finally retrieves it from him. Meanwhile home plate
ump Vic Delmore has handed a second ball to Anderson. Through all this,
Musial reaches first with what he thinks is ball four, and then streaks
for 2B. Simultaneously, Dark and Anderson fire to the bag. Anderson's throw
goes into CF, but Dark's to Banks catches the sliding Musial. Stan ignores
the tag and rambles to 3B as play is stopped. Delmore then rules Musial
is out at 2B, while Al Barlick rules Stan safe at 1B. Both managers play
the game under protest, but the Cards drop theirs after dropping the Cubs,
4-1. The NL will drop Vic Delmore at the end of the season.

The Giants' Sam Jones throws a 2-0 one-hitter against the Dodgers, allowing
only Jim Gilliam's controversial single in the 8th, a grounder SS Andre
Rodgers has difficulty picking up. Willie Mays' 2-run HR against Don Drysdale
accounts for all the scoring.

1960
Dick Stuart blasts 3 consecutive HRs, as the Pirates split with the
Giants. Stuart drives in 7 runs and joins Ralph Kiner as the 2nd Pirate to
hit 3 HRs in a game at Forbes Field. Jack Sanford pitches a 3-hit shutout
to give the Giants an 11-0 first-game win. With the 11-6 nitecap victory,
Pittsburgh is 3 games ahead of the 2nd-place Braves.

The Braves lose to the Cubs in Chicago, 11-5, as Cubs pitcher Don Cardwell
has 4 hits.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

At Fenway, SS Don Buddin pulls some fancy footwork to lead the Bosox to a
win against the Tigers. With the score tied in the 8th, Buddin is caught in
a rundown between 3B and home, but he eludes Detroit catcher Red Wilson to
score. Wilson argues that Buddin left the baseline, and earns a rejection
by Red Flaherty for his views. The Red Sox score 3 more runs and win,
11-7. Ted Williams has a HR, off Bunning, and Colavito answers with 2 homers.

1961
Whitey Ford (14-2) becomes the first pitcher in American League history to
win eight games in one month. 'Slick's' complete-game 5-1 victory over the
Senators is the Yankees' 22nd win in June. Maris drives in 3 runs and Mantle
lines a shot over CF Willie Tasby that rebounds for an inside-the-park HR.

1962
Due to an unusually thick fog at Colt Stadium, the game against the Reds
is called after seven innings giving the Colt .45's a 7-3 victory over
Cincinnati. The fog is so thick that the outfielders can't see home plate.
The shortened contest allows Houston's skipper Harry Craft to get to the
hospital in time for the birth of his first daughter.

With the aid of 13 strikeouts and a Frank Howard HR, Sandy Koufax no-hits
Bob Miller and the Mets 5-0 in Los Angeles. Sandy starts off the game by
fanning the side on 9 pitches in the first inning, the first NL pitcher to
strike out the side on 9 pitches since Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance, in 1924.

1964
At Wrigley Field, the Reds' Joey Jay allows just 2 hits but loses to the
Cubs, 1-0. Larry Jackson does him one better, allowing just one hit and
driving in the lone run with a single. Jackson's no hit bid is stopped in
the 7th when Pete Rose singles.

1967
Losing 12-3 in the 2nd game against the Giants, the Phils send in utility
man Cookie Rojas to pitch the 9th. Rojas throws a scoreless inning and has
now played all 9 positions since arriving in the big leagues in 1963.

1970
A sellout crowd of 51,050 is on hand for the dedication of Cincinnati's
Riverfront Stadium, rushed to completion so the Reds can host the All-Star
game. There is no electricity in the refreshments areas, and the scoreboard
occasionally misfires. But Hank Aaron doesn't misfire as he hits the park's
first homerun in the first inning, off Cincinnati's starter Jim McGlothin. The
Braves win, 8-2.

1972
Joe Pepitone rejoins the Cubs after a brief retirement, and is 1 for 4 in
the Cubs' 4-3 win over the Pirates. Rick Reuschel allows 2 hits in 7 1/3
innings before leaving with a twisted ankle, but picks up the win. Billy
Williams drives in 3 runs for the Cubs.

1973
The first-place Dodgers spot the Reds a 5-1 lead, before coming back to win,
8-7, in 13 innings. The Reds (39-37) are in 4th place.

The Cubs, leading by 7 games, lose to the Mets and Jon Matlack, 2-1.

1975
After losing to Boston, 5-2, in game 1, Baltimore C Dave Duncan ties the ML
record with 4 consecutive doubles (he'll total just 7 doubles for the year)
during an 8-2 win over first-place Boston in game 2. Compounding the loss,
Boston P Dick Pole suffers a broken cheek bone when he is hit by a line
drive off the bat of 1B Tony Muser.

The Brewers whip the Yanks, 5-4, by scoring 2 runs in the bottom of the
9th. Bobby Darwin's 8th homer of the year is the big blow. Bill Travers
(4-0) takes the win. Milwaukee, winners of 15 out of their last 21, is in
3rd place in the East.

For the 3rd time in 4 days, the Reds win on an extra-inning homerun. This
time, Johnny Bench belts a 3-run homer in the bottom of the 12th and the
Reds whip the Astros, 9-6. Clay Kirby gets the decision.

1976
Nolan Ryan makes a one-batter start, the shortest start of his career,
after his name is mistakingly put on the lineup. He retires Chet Lemon,
then gives way to Gary Ross, who gives up a run in 7 2/3 innings. California
pushes across a run in the 9th to win, 2-1, over Chicago.

1977
At Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, Cliff Johnson joins Joe DiMaggio and Joe
Pepitone as the only players in Yankee history to hit two homeruns in the
same inning (his 2nd and 3rd consecutive HRs). The designated hitter goes
deep twice in the eighth as the Bronx Bombers score eight runs in an 11-5
win over the Blue Jays. Johnson is the 2nd player in 3 days to hit a pair
of homers in an inning. New York (42-33) is a half-game behind the Red Sox.

The host Reds beat the Giants, 11-5, as Joe Morgan paces the scoring with
5 runs and 2 stolen bases, despite going 0 for 2 at the plate. Max Carey,
