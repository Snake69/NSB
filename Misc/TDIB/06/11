bat in the 5th.

1902
Chicago's Clark Griffith beats the Boston Americans, 3-2, snapping Cy

when Deacon Phillippe throws his 3rd straight whitewash, defeating Brooklyn,

Joe Elinich, Phils' manager Chief Zimmer calls Phelps, "the best catcher
in the game" and "a coming star."

1904
After pitching nine and a third innings of no-hit baseball, Cubs hurler Bob
Wicker settles for a 1-0 12-inning one-hit victory over the Giants. It's the
second time in Sam Mertes' career he breaks up an extra inning no-hitter
as the light-hitting outfielder playing for the White Sox started the
game-winning rally with a one-out tenth-inning single spoiling Indians'
righty Earl Moore's 1901 bid for a no-hitter.

Before a record-breaking crowd of 38,805 at New York's Polo Grounds, Iron
Joe McGinnity pitches 9 innings of scoreless ball against Chicago. The Colts'
Bob Wicker goes one better, tossing 9 innings without allowing a hit before
former Cub Sam Mertes singles with one out in the 10th to break up the no
hitter. Chicago wins it in the 12th, 1-0, when Johnny Evers' 2-out single
off McGinnity scores Chance. It is Iron Joe's first loss after 14 straight
wins. Wicker is near flawless, allowing one other hit and striking out 10.

At Detroit, the Tigers beat the Senators, 8-3, behind Wild Bill

1906
At Boston, the Boston Beaneaters' Dave Brain makes a ML record 5 errors at 3B,

his 4th of the year.

1909
At the West Side Grounds, Boston wins over Chicago, 4-2, for their only win

the plate drives in two Doves with a triple. Boston will go 1-21 against
the Cubs and 1-20 versus the Pirates.

1911
At Chicago's West Side Grounds, Heinie Zimmerman of the Cubs drives in nine
runs to set a team record. The Windy City infielder, whose record will be
tied by Sammy Sosa in 2002, hits two homeruns, a triple and two singles in
the 20-2 rout of the Braves. Jimmy Sheckard scores 5 runs.

1912
New York's Red Ames is the victor over the Cubs, 8-3. Mathewson relieves
Ames with a 4-3 lead, and K's 3 of the 6 batters he faces. Heinie Zimmerman
argues a strike call and gets an ejection and 3-day suspension.

1913
The Browns end the A's 15-game winning streak, 5-2, but Philadelphia's
5-game lead over Cleveland will be maintained to the end.

With the score tied 5-5, Ivy Olson of Cleveland steals home in the top of
the 15th for the winning run over the Red Sox. Jack Graney then steals home
for an insurance run, marking the only time teammates would steal home in
extra innings in the same game. Dutch Leonard watches on the mound for Boston.

1914
The Cubs score 5 runs in the 6th inning against the Giants to hand Mathewson
a 7-4 loss.

1915
At the Polo Grounds in a 10-9 victory over the White Sox, Ray Caldwell
becomes first major leaguer to hit a homerun in consecutive pinch hit
appearances. Nobody else in the AL repeats the feat until Joe Cronin in
1943. The Yankee pitcher, who will win 19 games this season, hit the first
of his two round trippers as a pinch hitter yesterday, also against Chicago,
in a 5-4 loss. Tomorrow Caldwell will hit another, but he is on the mound
in that game.

The Reds finally beat the Robins, 1-0, in 15 innings as Rube Benton pitches
a complete game shutout. Tommy Griffith's single drives in the winning
run. Yesterday, the two teams battled to a 2-2 tie in 14 innings.

Giants catcher Larry McLean, suspended by McGraw for 10 days, goes on a
rampage at Buckingham Hotel in St. Louis and picks a fight with McGraw
and scout Dick Kinsella. McGraw banishes the catcher saying he'll never
play for the Giants again. Mathewson, unperturbed, beats the Cards in
the afternoon. McLean will be shipped to the Cards, from whence he came,
on August 6th for Doc Crandall.

1916
In the 7th inning against the A's, Cleveland's Guy Morton ties a ML record
by striking out 4 batters. Cleveland wins, 7-2.

1917
The Reds edge Brooklyn, 3-2, helped by an inside-the-park homer by Greasy
Neale. He'll hit another on June 21st.

1918
The franchise owners in the Southern League vote to suspend operations on
June 28. Transportation difficulties, increasing rail rates and lack of
interest in some cities are the reasons cited. In 9 days the 6-team Texas
League will vote not to add New Orleans and Beaumont for the remainder of
the year. The stumbling block is New Orleans, which wanted the right to
pull out for next year in case the Southern League reorganizes.

Lefty Tyler allows 2 hits but the Giants win, 1-0, on a fluke homer in the
1st inning by George Burns. He hits a line single to Max Flack who falls
down and the ball skips by for an inside-the-park homer. The Cubs' 9-game
win streak ends.

The Pirates' Roy Sanders and Boston's Bunny Hearn battle for 16 innings
before the Bucs win, 3-2, on a bases-loaded squeeze play. Sanders allows

8-4. New York scores 3 in the 7th on a walk, 3 hits and a Williams throwing
error. Gene Robertson, a sub, adds the game's topper in the 7th when he lifts
a high fly behind the Browns' dugout and the ball strikes owner Phil Ball on
the cheek giving him a mild concussion and requiring 4 stitches. Following
the game, Shocker will miss 3 weeks in June and July because of a thigh
injury, but he still racks up 348 innings, 2nd in the AL.

1925
Four days after his average tops .400, Rogers Hornsby buys 1,167 shares in

retains the right to buy back the stock at 6% interest.

Ty Cobb drives in 2 runs in the 1st inning off Walter Johnson to lead the
Tigers to a 7-4 win.

1926
The Phils top Pittsburgh, 13-11, as Russ Wrightstone hits for the
cycle. Wrightstone adds a double as he goes 5 for 6 with 4 long hits.

1927
After 5 wins in a row, the A's lose to the Tigers, 5-4. Despite Lefty
Grove being lifted for a pinch hitter in the 8th, for the 9th inning the
Philadelphia Athletics field a team of seven Hall of Famers. The outfield
consists of Ty Cobb in right, Al Simmons in center and Zack Wheat in left. At
1B is Jimmie Foxx, while at 2B is Eddie Collins. Cy Perkins started as
catcher batting seventh, but when Mickey Cochrane pinch-hit for him in the
last inning, seven Cooperstown-bound players were in the lineup. On May
24th of next year, the A's will again field 7 HOFers and combine with the
Yanks to showcase 13 Hall of Famers.

In New York, Babe Ruth clouts two consecutive homeruns (numbers 19 and 20)
off Garland Buckeye, but in his next time up Ruth is set upon by Cleveland
C Luke Sewell who demands that the umpires inspect the Bambino's bat. The
umps find nothing illegal, but the crowd of 30,000 cheer the Babe, who
strikes out. Lazzeri adds a homer and New York wins, 6-4. Burns is 3 for
3 with 2 doubles for the Tribe.

The Dodgers spoil Paul Waner Day in Pittsburgh beating the Bucs, 11-10. Waner,
who's wedding was last night, collects 3 hits, including a double and
a 7-passenger car, and teammate Barnhart has 2 triples and a double, but
it's not enough. Brooklyn has 15 hits and scores 4 times in the 9th to give
Vance the win.

record by stealing 7 bases. The record will be equaled by Lee Mazzilli and
Rickey Henderson.

1928

Cubs as the Cards win, 13-2.

In game 1, White Sox vet Al Simmons belts a grand slam off Washington's
Bobby Burke, but his 5 RBIs are not enough as Washington wins, 9-8. The Sox
take the nitecap, 9-3. Showing he's in the groove, Simmons will repeat the
slam in three days off Nats hurler Belva Bean.

1937
In one of the Giants' worst trades, popular Fred Fitzsimmons is sent to
Brooklyn for rookie prospect Tom Baker.

It is Zeke Bonura Day at Comiskey Park. After receiving a car in pregame

in 5 runs with a HR, 2 doubles and a single.

1938
Cincinnati lefthander Johnny Vander Meer pitches a no-hitter against Boston,
winning 3-0. Vander Meer, in his first full season, strikes out 4 to increase
his league-leading total to 56. Danny MacFayden is the losing pitcher. It
is the first of two consecutive no-hitters Vander Meer will hurl.

Cardinals OF Terry Moore sustains a concussion after crashing into a wall
at Sportsman's Park. The game with the Giants ends in a rained out 8-inning
2-2 tie.

1939
In game 1 in Chicago, Ted Lyons wins another Sunday outing beating Boston,
7-5, and pitches the last 4 innings without allowing a walk. He will go

In the 2nd of two, Paul Dean debuts with the Giants and beats the Cubs, 3-1,
on 4 hits. Joe Moore runs his hitting streak to 14 games when he belts an
8th inning homer off Claude Passeau. The Giants win the opener 4-0 behind
Bill Lohrman to pull within 1 1/2 games of the Reds and Dodgers. Bill Lee
is the losing Cubs hurler in that one.

In Boston, the Indians chase Bob Feller, 9-2, on homers by Williams and
Cronin. Williams adds a triple, while Finney has four hits including a pair
of doubles. During the game, Tribe manager Oscar Vitt openly criticizes
Feller, saying "Look at him. He's supposed to be my ace. How am I supposed
to win a pennant with that kind of pitching." The Boston win keeps the Sox
a game ahead of Detroit and Cleveland.

1944
Gene Moore hits a pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom of the 7th off Joe
Heving of Cleveland to give the Browns a 4-2 win in a doubleheader split

Cards up their NL lead to 5 1/2 games. The Cards turn 4 double plays in game
1 and 5 in game 2 to up the NL mark from 7 in a DH. The 1943 Senators had
7 DPs in a double header. 2B Emil Verban is in 7 of the twin killings. In

off Clyde Shoun - by Walker Cooper, Whitey Kurowski and Danny Litwhiler.

Hall of Famer pops to short.

1948
The Indians hold on to beat the Yankees, 10-8, as reliever Bob Feller fans
Sherm Lollar with the bases full to end the game. DiMaggio had led off the
9th with a homer. Game highlites include Yogi Berra getting tossed by Cal
Hubbard and young Bobby Brown being replaced at 2B in the 8th by George
Stirnweiss, a move that will remain permanent for the season. Lou Boudreau
ends a Tribe rally in the 7th by striking out - his first K in 42 games. The
game - interrupted by rain and a fans' missile barrages - ends at 12:20 a.m.

1952
Hello, cuz. Hank Sauer hits 3 homers off Curt Simmons at Wrigley Field to
account for all the scoring as the Cubs, behind Turk Lown, beat the Phillies
3-2. It is Hammerin' Hank's 2nd three-homer game ... the first came in 1950,
also off Curt Simmons. Sauer is now leading the NL in HR (18), RBIs (58)
and batting average (.352), but he'll go hitless in his next 24 at-bats,
striking out 10 times, and his average will drop 32 points in a week.

At Fenway Park, Bosox catcher Sammy White clouts a 9th inning grand slam
with one out to defeat the Brown's Satchel Paige, 11-9. Paige (5-2) takes a
9-5 lead into the 9th. White completes his homerun trot by rounding 3B and
crawling from half way home and kissing the plate. Another rookie provides
entertainment to start the inning as Piersall, leading off, announces to
Paige that he is going to bunt. He does just that and beats Paige to 1B,
where upon he starts mirroring Satchel's moves and yelling "oink, oink,
oink." Evers beats out an infield hit and Piersall continues his antics
at 2B. A now distracted and annoyed Paige walks Kell, and one out later,
forces in a run by walking Goodman. A single by Lepcio sets up White's
slam. After the game, Browns C Clint Courtney opines, "I believe that man
is plumb crazy. Yeah, he's nuts altogether. I never saw a man do those
things. Anywhere."

1953
Behind the pitching of Jim McDonald and Allie Reynolds, first-place New
York beats Detroit, 6-3, to run their win streak to 14 games. New York
gets a game winner from Mantle off Art Houtteman that crowns the roof in
right center at Detroit. Mantle has now hit in 16 straight games, but will
go hitless tomorrow, when he pulls a thigh muscle. Hitting .353 at the end
of today, Mantle will hit just .255 the rest of the year. The Yankees get
another tape-measure blast when Joe Collins hits a 2-out 7th-inning homer
that lands on the 98-foot high press box over the 370-foot sign.

1954
The Tigers hit 6 HRs in a game against the Athletics, winning 16-5, to get

his career.

in the top of the 7th and the 5 homeruns in the inning ties a ML mark.

At Wrigley, the Giants get a 9th inning homer by Ray Kaat, his first in
the majors, to tie the Cubs at 4 apiece. But Eddie Miksis hits the first
pitch in the 10th for a catwalk HR to left to give the Cubs and Jim Davis
the 5-4 win. The loser is Davis' uncle Marv Grissom. The two teams combine
for 9 errors.

1955
The Dodgers win their 6th in a row to increase their lead to 10 1/2 games. The
lead will not dip below 10 games for the remainder of the season.

1956

have been 745 homers in the majors, hit by 192 players; at this point in the
1927 season, there were 320 homers, hit by 140 ball players. NL President
Warren Giles will retort that bigger players, not livelier balls, account
for the present-day hitting feats.

1957
In a 7-2 loss to the Braves, Dodger C Roy Campanella hits his 237th career
HR, surpassing career marks of Gabby Hartnett and Yogi Berra. The Braves

At Fenway, the White Sox set an AL record with just 7 assists in a twi-night
doubleheader split against the Red Sox, losing 5-4 and winning 8-4. With 2

for fewest assists in 2 consecutive games. Don Buddin hits a leadoff HR in
the day game off Early Wynn, who allows just one more hit till the 6th. After
a Runnels single, Wynn knocks down Williams with an inside pitch. Ted then
belts his 497th homer, a 450-foot shot. Wertz follows a walk to Williams
in the 8th with a HR.

1961
In game 1 of a twin bill at Tiger Stadium, Norm Cash becomes the first

Terry's 5-hitter. Yogi Berra clouts a pair of solo homers. In the nitecap,

pair of homeruns, his 19th and 20th, as New York wins 5-1. The Yanks have
won 10 of 11 games.

1962
With the bases loaded in the 3rd against the Indians, Boston pitcher Earl

the winner.

Yankees and 5 by the Tigers) in 1950.

Adolfo Phillips blasts 4 HRs in a doubleheader, 3 of them in consecutive
at-bats in the 2nd game, as the Cubs sweep the Mets at Wrigley Field,
5-3 and 18-10. The total of eleven HRs in the 2nd game sets a NL record
for 2 clubs in 9 innings and the 2 teams tie a NL mark when they total 40
extra bases on long hits (Chi - 26, NY - 14). The mark was set on July 31,
1954. Adolpho has 6 hits and 8 RBIs on the day.

Before the largest AL crowd of 1967 - 62,582 - at Yankee Stadium for Bat

1969
Maury Wills returns to Los Angeles with OF Manny Mota. IF Paul Popovich and OF

to set an AL record but he loses to California, 5-4. In the 4th inning,

to Frank Robinson. It is a tear in his rotator cuff. He'll throw just 2
more innings, his career over at 32. Dick Lange is the winning pitcher.

1976
Leading 4-3 in the last of the 11th, White Sox reliever Terry Forster

of brother combos. Five Murray brothers play pro ball.

1981
Attempting to break Stan Musial's National League record for hits, Pete
Rose hits a wicked infield grounder which the official scorer rules an error
rather than giving the Phillies first baseman his historic hit. Amidst the

as an anxious stadium engineer ignites the planned celebration prematurely
thinking he heard Bill Giles said 'go' into the walkie-talkie, when the
Phillies president had really said 'no'.

the last game played before the major league players go on strike. The work

to leave his team because of a substance-abuse problem this season.

1985
Von Hayes becomes the first ML player ever to hit 2 homeruns in the
first inning, leading off with a homerun, off Tom Gorman, and capping a
9-run outburst with a grand slam, as the Phillies go on to rout the Mets
26-7. Mets relievers Joe Sambito (3 innings) and Calvin Schiraldi (1 1/3
innings) both give up 10 runs apiece. The 26 runs in one game is a club
record and the most in the NL since 1944.

1987
Having traded for him last December, the Phillies deal Mike Easler back to
the Yankees for a pair of minor leaguers.

1988
Yankee skipper Billy Martin, due to a shortage of right-handed hitters to
face Orioles' southpaw Jeff Ballard, decides to use starting pitcher Rick
Rhoden as his designated hitter, making the right-hander the first hurler
ever start as the DH. In his lone plate appearance, Rhoden hits a sacrifice
fly before being pinch-hit for (by Jose Cruz) in the fifth inning of the
Yankees' 8-6 victory over Baltimore. Rhoden batted seventh in the Yankees'
lineup, ahead of Rafael Santana and Joel Skinner.

1990
At the age of 43, Nolan Ryan pitches his unprecedented 6th career no-hitter,
striking out 14 batters in a 5-0 win over the A's. He becomes the oldest
player to throw a no-hitter. Ryan is the first to pitch a no-hitter for
3 different teams, and the first to throw a no-hitter in 3 different
decades. The A's are missing McGwire, Canseco and Lansford in the lineup.

Phils Lenny Dykstra's hitting streaks stops at 23 games, as he goes 0 for

1993
Seattle P Erik Hanson allows 4 runs on a single in the 4th inning of the
Mariners' 8-2 loss to California. With the bases loaded, Greg Myers strokes
a single to left. Left fielder Henry Cotto boots the ball, then throws over
the head of C Bill Haselman as 2 runs score. Hanson, who is backing up home,
fires the ball over 3B Edgar Martinez' head allowing 2 more runners to score.

The Yankees-Brewers game at County Stadium is interrupted by some 100 sea
gulls who swoop down onto the field, apparently in search of moths hatching
in the infield and outfield grass. The Yankees eventually win the game
by a score of 5-4, winning in the 9th on a two-run pinch homer by Kevin
Maas. While no players or seagulls are hurt, Wade Boggs called the situation
"terribly dangerous." The seagulls will return for tomorrow night's game,
but the Brewers will be prepared for the birds. Gus the wonder dog, on loan
from the Wisconsin waterfowl association, will keep them away.

The Mets trade SS Tony Fernandez to the Blue Jays in exchange for OF
Darrin Jackson.

15 straight saves in 15 appearances with the Indians.

Oakland's Mark McGwire hits 3 consecutive HRs in an 8-1 win over the Red
Sox. McGwire hit 2 HRs yesterday, giving him a ML record-tying 5 HRs in 2
consecutive games. He is the 15th player to hit 5 homers in 2 games, and
only the 2nd to do so twice in his career. He also hit 5 homers on June 27
and 28, 1987. Ralph Kiner performed the feat twice in 1947.

Cincinnati defeats Houston, 3-2, in 10 innings on Ron Gant's HR. It is
Gant's 4th extra-inning homer of the season, tying him with Willie Mays
for the NL record. Charlie Maxwell hit 5 for the Tigers in 1960.

The Giants score 4 times in the bottom of the 9th inning in their game with
Montreal to tie the score at 8-8, but the Expos score twice in the 13th to
win, 10-8. Montreal OF Rondell White strokes 6 hits while becoming the 4th
Expo to ever hit for the cycle. White's hits include a single, 2 doubles,
a triple and a HR. He scores 5 runs, while picking up 3 ribbies.

1996
The Mariners make Rick Aguilera's 2nd start of the season a disaster by
rocking him for 10 runs and 10 hits in 3+ innings. Dan Wilson has five of
the M's 24 hits as Seattle wins over host Minnesota, 18-8. Joey Cora and
Alex Rodriguez each have 4 hits to back Wells (6-1).

The Brewers retire Paul Molitor's uniform before taking the field to lose
to the Twins, 9-7.

drives home 5 runs. He becomes just the 10th player to have a 3-homer game
while playing shortstop throughout.

The Orioles defeat the Braves, 6-2, as Albert Belle's streak of 392
consecutive games (the longest active streak) is ended. Belle is benched
by Baltimore manager Ray Miller for failing to run out a ground ball.

2001
Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy fires Cam Bonifay. Seven losing seasons and
several ill-fated free-agent signings do in the long-time GM. New GM Dave
Littlefield will start July 13 and wholesale housecleaning will start
soon thereafter.

2002
In the top of the ninth inning during the Indians and Phillies interleague
game at Jacobs Field, an explosive device thrown from the upper deck explodes
in a lower-level smoking area causing minor injuries to two people. Three
young men suspected of causing the blast, which is heard throughout the
ballpark, are held on suspicion of felonious assault and aggravated arson.

With Jared Sandberg hitting 2 homers in the frame, Tampa Bay scores 9 runs
in the 5th inning on its way to an 11-2 win over the Dodgers.

Two days after losing a 15-inning 4.5 hour marathon, the Braves waste no time
in doing in the Twins, 11-0. Andruw Jones, Vinny Castilla and Matt Franco
hit back-to-back-to-back homers in the 7-run 5th inning. The Braves last
hit 3 straight on April 18, 1994. Tommy Glavine (11-2) pitches 7 scoreless
innings for the win.

2003
The Astros shut out the Yankees, 8-0, as six Houston pitchers combine to
throw a no-hitter - the most ever to do so on a no-no. Starter Roy Oswalt
leaves the game in the 2nd inning with a strained groin. He is followed in
turn by Peter Munro, Kirk Saarloos, Brad Lidge, Octavio Dotel and Billy
Wagner, who combine to hold the Yankees hitless for the first time since
1958 when Orioles' knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm accomplished the feat with
a 1-0 victory in Baltimore. It is the longest streak without being no-hit
- 6,980 games - in ML history. Dotel ties a record by striking out 4 New
Yorkers in the 8th inning. The Yankees tie the AL record by striking out 8
consecutive times. It was the 4th time it's happened, the first since the
Mariners struck out 8 consecutive times off Roger Clemens in his first 20-K
game (April 29, 1986). The major league record for number of pitchers used
in a shutout is 8, by the Red Sox, in a 10 inning game on October 3, 1999.

2004

winning streak, the longest such streak since the advent of interleague play.

2005

in the 9th inning as the Mets match the Angels, 2-2. The Angels plate a
run in the top of the 10th but Cliff Floyd's 3-run homer in the bottom of
the frame ends it, 5-3.

2006
The Devil Rays beat the Royals, 8-2. In the process, Tampa Bay becomes the

the same game.

2008
With the score knotted at two at Dolphin Stadium, Marlins second baseman
Dan Uggla hits a walk-off grand slam to beat the first place Phillies,
6-2. It's the second time in franchise history a game has ended with a
bases loaded dinger with Bobby Bonilla accomplishing the feat against the
Rockies in 1997. The best play of the night is made in Section 253 as a fan
catches a foul ball in his beer cup. After removing the prized possession,
the happy patron continues to drink his adult beverage.

2010
Andy Pettitte joins Whitey Ford and Red Ruffing as the only Yankee hurlers
to notch 200 victories with the club. The 37-year-old southpaw, who also
reaches the 3,000 career inning plateau in the first frame of the game,
gets his historic victory when New York beats Houston, his former team,
in an interleague contest in the Bronx, 4-3.

2013
In a much-anticipated major league debut, Gerrit Cole throws six scoreless
innings in the Pirates' 8-2 victory over San Francisco at PNC Park. A
larger-than-average Tuesday night crowd of 30,614, which includes over
10,000 walk-ups, are on hand to watch the overall 2011 First-Year Player
Draft No. 1 selection earn his first big league career victory.
