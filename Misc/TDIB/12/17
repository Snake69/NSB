1910
John Harris sells the Boston National League team to a syndicate headed
by William Hepburn Russell, a New York lawyer and city official, for
$100,000. The team will be nicknamed the Rustlers after their new owner.

1914
Charlie Comiskey pulls a surprise, reaching down to Peoria and naming Clarence
"Pants" Rowland, scout and minor league executive, to manage his White Sox.

1920
The AL votes to allow pitchers who used the spitball in 1920 to continue
using it as long as they are in the league. The NL will do the same. There
will be 17 designated spitters in all, 8 in the NL and 9 in the AL. For the
NL, the spitball pitchers are:  Bill Doak, Phil Douglas, Dana Fillingim,
Ray Fisher, Marv Goodwin, Burleigh Grimes, Clarence Mitchell and Dick
Rudolph. For the AL:  Doc Ayers, Ray "Slim" Caldwell, Stan Coveleskie,
Red Faber, H.B. "Dutch" Leonard, Jack Quinn, Allan Russell, Urban Shocker
and Allen Sothoron. One story has the White Sox forgetting to name Frank
Shellenback as a spitball pitcher, forcing him to go the PCL to throw a
wet one, where he wins 296 games.

1924
The Yankees get 4-time 20-game winner Urban Shocker from the Browns for
pitchers Milt Gaston, Joe Giard and Joe Bush. Shocker led the Browns in wins
in each of the past 5 seasons and will be a mainstay on 2 pennant-winning
staffs for New York. Bush had beaten the Browns 17 straight times after
losing to them on June 12, 1922.

The Senators add another veteran pitcher to its staff by purchasing Dutch
Ruether from Brooklyn. Ruether will go 30-13 for his year and a half in
Washington.

1928
At a joint meeting, a rule is changed that ends the practice of minor
league teams selling star prospects to friendly ML clubs for high prices,
then getting the players back, forcing another ML club to pay the reputed
price for the player. Other changes ban the signing of players under the
age of 17 and set a $7,500 price tag on any first-year player.

NL President John Heydler's designated hitter idea gets the backing of John
McGraw, but the AL is against it.

1932
The Cardinals trade former National League Most Valuable Player Jim Bottomley
to the Reds. The Redbirds get Estel Crabtree (of Crabtree, Ohio), who will
only play in 23 games, and Ownie Carroll, who will be shipped to Brooklyn
before the start of the season, in a deal which appears to be a steal for
a nine-time .300 hitter and future Hall of Famer with productive years left.

1935
Heinie Manush is traded from Washington to the Boston Red Sox for Roy
Johnson and Carl Reynolds.

1942
The Yankees trade OF Roy Cullenbine and C Buddy Rosar to the Indians for
Roy Weatherly and IF Oscar Grimes. With the draft in mind, all four players
are married with one child each. As noted by historian Lyle Spatz, Rosar
had been in the doghouse with Joe McCarthy for leaving the team without
permission the weekend of July 18-19 to take a police examination in
Buffalo. The leave-taking prompted the Yankees to sign vet C Rollie Hemsley.

1949
The Yankees and Detroit swap Dicks, the Tigers getting 1B Dick Kryhoski
while New York takes 1B Dick Wakefield, signed by the Tigers in 1941 with
a $52,000 bonus.

1953
In a tax-avoidance scheme, the New York Yankees sell Yankee Stadium and
Kansas City properties for $6.5 million in a deal with Johnson Corp and
the Knights of Columbus, who immediately lease the property back to the Yanks.

1957
The Pasadena City Board confers with the Dodgers on the possible temporary
use of the Rose Bowl.

1959
In a child-payment hearing related to his divorce, Ted Williams alleges the
Red Sox paid him $60,000, not the reported $100,000. He claims his entire
yearly income was $83,000.

1964
The Yankees fire long time television and radio voice Mel Allen. This well
known broadcaster popularized the 'going, going, gone' homerun call and
often said 'how about that' to describe happenings on the ball field.

1968
The owners announce they will increase contributions to the players'
pension fund by $1 million to $5.1 million per year. Players vote down the
proposal 491-7.

to manage the White Sox. Chuck Tanner then accepts a 3-year contract to
manage Oakland.

1992
The Twins sign home-grown free-agent DH/outfielder Dave Winfield. Last
season for the World Champion Blue Jays, the St. Paul native hit .290 and
had 108 RBIs and 26 homeruns.

1993
Rickey Henderson returns to the A's signing a two-year $8.6 million dollar

The Red Sox sign P Chris Hammond, who went 5-8 last year with the Marlins.

1998
Orioles GM Frank Wren signs free agent P Xavier Hernandez to a 2-year $2.5
million contract, only to find out when Hernandez takes a physical that

a 2-year contract.

2000
City and club officials announce plans for the financing and construction
of a new, downtown Miami retractable roof ballpark for the Marlins. The
state-of-the-art $385 million stadium, which will be a 40,000-seat facility
with 60 luxury suites, includes a 40-year lease and an agreement to rename
the team the Miami Marlins.

2001
The Yankees sign free agent OF Rondell White, who played for the Cubs this
past year, to a 2-year contract.

The Indians sign free agent SS Ricky Gutierrez to a 3-year contract.

2002
After bringing the Giants to the brink of a world championship, Russ Ortiz
(14-10, 3.78) is traded by the Giants to the Braves for sophomore southpaw
Damian Moss (12-6, 4.11) and minor league prospect Manuel Mateo. The
27-year-old right hander left game 6 with a 5-0 margin, but the Giants
bullpen was unable to hold the lead and lost the series to the Diamondbacks
in seven games.

The Braves sign free agent P Paul Byrd to a 2-year contract.

The Cubs sign free agent OF Troy O'Leary to a one-year contract for $750,000.

2003
After agreeing to the basics weeks ago, the Yankees and 35-year-old Gary
Sheffield (.330, 39, 132) finalize a $39 million three-year deal which
includes $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for
2007. The seven-time All-Star outfielder played with the Braves last year
and has spent time with the Padres, Marlins and Dodgers after breaking in
with the Brewers in 1988.

The Mariners sign free agent IF Scott Spiezio to a 3-year contract.

The Braves sign free agent C Eddie Perez to a 2-year contract.

2004
Although the terms of the deal are not made public, Edgar Renteria (.287,
10, 72) inks a four-year contract believed to be worth $40 million with the
World Champion Red Sox. The former Cardinal shortstop, who made the last out
in the World Series ending Boston's 86-year drought, replaces fellow Colombian
Orlando Cabrera, the player obtained in July in the Nomar Garciaparra trade.

The last place Mariners continue to sign impact free-agents in hopes to
improve upon last season's poor performance (63-99) as the team signs
25-year-old Adrian Beltre (.334, 48, 121) to a $64 million five-year
deal. The former Dodger third baseman joins Richie Sexson, a free agent
Seattle signed to a four-year $50 million contract two days ago.

A tentative three-team deal which includes Diamondback southpaw Randy Johnson
and pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii being traded to the Yankees, Dodger outfielder
Shawn Green and pitcher Brad Penny being sent to the Diamondbacks, with
Jose Vazquez and prospects going to the Dodgers falls apart at the eleventh
hour. The blockbuster transaction is stopped when LA backs out.

The Marlins sign free agent P Antonio Alfonseca to a contract.

2006
The White Sox sign free agent C Toby Hall to a 2-year contract.

2007
The Yankees continue to sign their own free agents as the team finalizes a
$45 million three-year contract with their 38-year-old closer, Mariano Rivera
(3-4, 3.15). Earlier in the off-season, the Bronx Bombers also signed Jorge
Posada ($52.4 million, 4 years), Alex Rodriguez ($275, 10 years) and Andy
Pettitte ($16 million, 1 year).

2010
After losing the right-hander to free-agency two seasons ago, the Cubs sign
Kerry Wood, one of the franchise's most popular players of the recent past,
to a $1.5 million one-year deal that includes bonuses for appearances
and games finished. After attending Ron Santo's funeral last week, the
33-year-old free-agent reached out to Tom Ricketts, letting the club owner
know he would accept a modest offer to return to the northside of Chicago.

The Tigers announce coming to terms with Magglio Ordonez when the outfielder
agrees to a one-year $10 million dollar deal. Two months ago, the team
declined a $15 million option on their starting right-fielder who suffered
a broken ankle in July and appearing in only 84 games.

The Padres and Orlando Hudson have agreed to a two-year deal valued at $11.5
million. The former Minnesota second baseman is expected the fill the void
by the departure of David Eckstein to free agency.

The Padres acquire their former shortstop Jason Bartlett and a player to
be named later by trading relievers Adam Russell and Cesar Ramos, along
with minor leaguer right-hander Brandon Gomes and infielder prospect Cole
Figueroa to the Rays. At the end of the day, the Friars will finalize
their deal with second baseman Orlando Hudson completing the team's new
double-play combination for next season.

2011
The Reds obtain right-hander Mat Latos from the Padres for four players
that include two former first-round picks, infielder Yonder Alonso and
catcher Yasmani Granda, along with starting pitcher Edinson Volque and
minor leaguer Brad Boxberger. The deal fills a serious need by bolstering
Cincinnati's rotation, but many observers believe the team gave up too much
to acquire the quality starter.

2012
In a seven-player swap, the Mets acquire highly-regarded minor leaguers
Travis d'Arnaud, a catcher, and righthanded pitcher Noah Syndergaard, in
addition to backstop John Buck and outfielder Wuilmer Becerra from the Blue
Jays in exchange for righthanded pitcher R.A. Dickey and catchers Josh Thole
and Mike Nickeas. New York decided to deal their 38-year-old knuckleballer,
last season's NL Cy Young award winner who had a year remaining on his
contract, to procure two of Toronto's top prospects.
