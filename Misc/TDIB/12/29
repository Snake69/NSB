Sending a huge dust cloud down the Ohio River, Cinergy Field, formerly known
as Riverfront Stadium, is imploded with 1,275 pounds of explosives. The
former home of the Reds (opened in 1970) was the site where Hank Aaron
tied Ruth's career homerun record on Opening Day in 1974, and Pete Rose
broke Ty Cobb's all-time hits record in 1985. The site will become the
western concourse of Great American Ball Park and will include the Reds'
Hall of Fame when it opens in 2004.

Agreeing to a $60 million five-year contract, Indians free agent Kevin
Millwood (9-11, 2.86) joins the Rangers new and improved rotation as the
ace the team has been seeking. The 31-year-old right-hander, who had the
lowest ERA in the American League last season, will anchor a staff which
also includes newcomers Vicente Padilla (9-12, 4.71) and Adam Eaton (11-5,
4.27) acquired from the Phillies and Padres respectively.

In an attempt to permit Cuba to participate in the 16-team World Baseball
Classic, Venezuela offers to host the Group C teams in place of the
U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico and suggests the finals be played in
Canada rather than in San Diego's PETCO Park. The changes in venue would
mean Castro's charges would avoid playing on U.S. soil, and not be subject
to the U.S. Treasury Department regulations which bans the team due to
American trade and financial embargoes.

The Yankees sign free agent P Octavio Dotel to a 1-year $2 million
contract. Dotel had Tommy John surgery in May and pitched just 15+ innings

to the Cardinals at the end of June, will most likely play first or third
base and hit fifth behind cleanup batter, Pablo Sandoval.

The Mets and Jason Bay, a former farmhand, agree to a four-year deal worth
approximately $66 million that includes a vesting option for a fifth year for
an additional $14 million. The 31-year-old outfielder joined the organization
as a minor leaguer in 2002 when Omar Minaya, then the general manager of
the Expos, traded the Class A pull hitter to New York, who shipped him four
months later to San Diego as part of an undistinguished deal.
