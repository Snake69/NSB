1906
The Athletics sell P Andy Coakley to Cincinnati. A 20-game winner in 1905,
he had slipped to 7-8. He will be an effective but hard-luck pitcher for the
next 2 years before starting a 37-year career as baseball coach at Columbia
University. The right-hander pitched under the name of Jack McAllister as
a rookie in 1902.

1907
Friction between his catchers and the need to strengthen the Giants infield
prompt John McGraw to trade Frank Bowerman, along with Bill Dahlen, Dan
McGann, George Browne and George Ferguson to Boston for young SS Al Bridwell,
veteran 1B and recently fired manager Fred Tenney, and reserve C Tom Needham.

1910
Former New York Giant Dan McGann, 39, who ended his 13-year career in 1908,
shoots himself in a Louisville hotel.

1911
At the NL meetings at the Waldorf-Astoria, The Sporting Life reports
that "For the first time in history a woman sat in at a major league
meeting. Mrs. H. H. Britton, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, remained
throughout the entire session of the National League on the second
day. Mrs. Britton took no voice in the meeting. She allowed President
Steininger to do all the voting."

The Boston Rustlers (formerly the Doves) are bought by New York politician
James E. Gaffney and former player, now attorney, John Montgomery Ward. The
team will be called the Braves because of Gaffney's Tammany Hall connections.

1916
AL owners unanimously approve the sale of the Red Sox to Harry Frazee and
Hugh Ward.

1922
The Phils buy IF Heinie Sand from Salt Lake City (PCL) for 4 players and
cash. A competent SS, Sand will be the object of an alleged bribery scheme
that causes another scandal.

Alarmed at the increase in HR hitting (1,054 in the major leagues, up from
936), some AL owners back a zoning system setting a minimum of 300 feet for
a ball to be called a HR. The motion dies. In another action, the league
requires each club to furnish 2 home uniforms per player, plus extra caps and
stockings on the road, to improve the players' appearance. In NL meetings,
Charlie Ebbets proposes putting numbers on players' sleeves or caps. It's
left to each club to do as it wishes.

1923
The Braves acquire 2B Cotton Tierney from the Phils for SS Hod Ford and OF
Ray Powell. Powell is later replaced by OF Al Nixon.

1927
Senators president Clark Griffith gains approval to have Washington open the
AL season one day before the rest of the league, to celebrate a "National Day"
with the U.S. president throwing out the first ball. The AL also installs
Ernest S. Barnard as its president.

The Cards trade P Jimmy Ring to the Phils with C Johnny Schulte for C Bubber
Jonnard, SS Jimmy Cooney and OF John Mokan.

1930
The 15-year career of George Sisler ends as the Boston Braves release
him. A lifetime .340 hitter who twice led the AL with averages above .400,
Sisler would be among the first to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame,
enshrined in 1939.

1934
The Cardinals sell minor league prospect Johnny Mize to Cincinnati for
$55,000. He is later returned because of a suspect knee and does not make
his debut until 1936.

1938
Fred Frankhouse returns to the Boston Bees, and Joe Stripp goes to Brooklyn
in a player swap. In a separate transaction, the Dodgers send Buddy Hassett
and Jimmy Outlaw to the Bees for Gene Moore and Ira Hutchinson.

1940
Vet ump George Moriarty is removed from the active staff and transferred
to the AL promotional department.

1941
The Red Sox send P Jack Wilson and infielder Stan Spence to the Senators
for Ken Chase and Johnny Welaj.

1948
After a year in New York, Red Embree is traded, along with young C Sherm
Lollar, Dick Starr and $100,000, to the Browns. Embree will slump to 3-13
in St. Louis after having his only winning ML season in NY. Lollar is the
prize, and will catch in the majors through 1963. The Yankees receive Fred
Sanford and Roy Partee. Partee is ticketed for the minors, but Sanford will
help the Yanks as a starter/reliever in 1949.

1949
The Browns send star 3B Bob Dillinger (.324) and OF Paul Lehner to the A's
for a reported $100,000 and infielders Frankie Gustine, and Billy DeMars,
and outfielders Ray Coleman and Ray Ippolito. Dillinger will play just a
half-season in Philley before being swapped to Pittsburgh.

1954
The Dodgers shed part of an era, sending P Preacher Roe and 3B Billy Cox
to Baltimore for 2 unknowns and cash. The Orioles will complete this deal
next March by sending OF Frank Kellert to Brooklyn for P Erv Palica.

1956
The Dodgers trade Jackie Robinson to the cross-town rivals, the Giants, for
pitcher Dick Littlefield and $35,000. Jackie, according to some accounts had
already decided privately to leave the game to work for Chock Full of Nuts,
publicly retires from baseball rather than accept the trade.

1961
Mickey Mantle signs a 1962 contract for $82,000. Only Joe DiMaggio has been
paid more by the Yankees.

1966
The Giants trade pitcher Bob Priddy and outfielder Cap Peterson to the
Senators to reacquire Mike McCormick. In his second stint with the team,
the left-hander will win the Cy Young Award next season compiling a 22-10
record with an ERA of 2.85.

1969
Curt Flood attends the Players' Association executive board meeting to seek
financial assistance in his attempt to sue major league baseball on the
grounds that the reserve clause violates Federal antitrust laws. Although
skeptical about the outcome of the suit, the player reps vote 25-0 to support
the recently traded outfielder, who refuses to report to the Phillies after
being dealt by the Cardinals.

The Red Sox send 1B Syd O'Brien and pitcher Billy Farmer and cash to the
White Sox for P Gary Peters and C Don Pavletich. Boston also picks up 3B
Tommy Matchick from the Tigers for Dalton Jones. Farmer will announce his
retirement and in March the White Sox will replace him with P Gerry Janeski.

1982
Free-agent P Floyd Bannister, who led the AL with 209 strikeouts at Seattle
last season, signs a 5-year contract with the White Sox for a reported $4.5
million. As compensation, the M's will pick minor leaguer Danny Tartabull
from the player pool on January 20.

The Indians sign free agent P Mike Jackson to a 2-year contract.

The Blue Jays sign free agent P Roger Clemens (10-13) to a 3-year contract
worth $24.75 million. The Red Sox' last minute offer falls short and the
Rocket's flirtation with the Yankees comes to naught. Clemens was with
Boston for thirteen seasons and leaves the team tied with Cy Young for the
team record for wins (192) and shutouts (38) and the career leader in losses
with 112 (Cy lost 111). The Sox are successful in retaining Tim Naehring,
who was minutes away from signing with Cleveland.

Aaron Ledesma, the Devil Rays obtain 3B Vinny Castilla, the Brewers obtain
Ps Jamey Wright and Jimmy Haynes, and C Henry Blanco, and the Athletics
obtain P Justin Miller.

The Marlins obtain OF Brant Brown from the Pirates in exchange for OF
Bruce Aven.

Red Sox P Tom Gordon has ligament reconstruction surgery on his right elbow,
and will miss the 2000 season. According to the Red Sox, there is only a 15%
to 20% chance that he will ever pitch again.

2000
Outbidding the Indians, the Red Sox sign free-agent Manny Ramirez to a
reported eight-year $160 million contract. The very lucrative deal pales
in comparison to Alex Rodriguez' 252 million ten-year agreement with the
Rangers which is also announced today.

The Braves sign 1B Rico Brogna to a contract.

The Padres sign IF Alex Arias to a 2-year contract.

2001
The Yankees sign free-agent Jason Giambi to a seven-year deal worth $120

this season. In another move, New York acquired OF John Vander Wal from
San Francisco in exchange for P Jay Witasick.

The Red Sox trade frustrated flychaser Carl Everett (.257, 14, 58) to the

outfielder, who had his problems with players and managers in Boston,
says he is looking forward to joining the veteran players in Texas.

The Dodgers obtain P Paul Quantrill and IF Cesar Izturis from the Blue Jays

2002
The Cardinals sign free agent P Chris Carpenter to a contract.

2003

for one season.

Weaver, minor league P Yhency Brazoban, a player to be named and $2.6 million.

contract.

The Astros re-sign free agent C Brad Ausmus to a 2 year $7.5 million contract.

2007
The Mitchell Report, a document of 409 pages as well as a paper trial of
115,000 copies of receipts, canceled checks, telephone records and e-mail
messages, is released. The much anticipated investigative missive, the work
of former Senator George Mitchell and his committee, calls the steroid era
in the sport a collective failure and names 89 former and present big league
players who allegedly used illegal, performance-enhancing drugs, including
potential Hall of Famers Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds and Gary Sheffield.

Alex Rodriguez and the Yankees finalize a 10-year $275 million contract
making the deal the richest in baseball history. A-Rod, who surpasses the
all-time salary record he signed with the Rangers - $252 million in 2000,
chastises his agent, Scott Boras, and blames himself for the poor handling
of his opt-out clause with the team.

With the winning auction bid of approximately $100,000, a collection of
rare written documents, including personal letters and cancelled checks
concerning the Chicago Black Sox scandal, is procured by the Chicago History
Museum. The historical papers offer new details about the White Sox allegedly
fixing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.

Avoiding salary arbitration Brandon Duckworth agrees to a one-year $600,000
contract, including $155,000 in performance incentives, to pitch for the
Royals next season. The 31-year-old right-hander, who spent time on the
disabled list with a torn left oblique, posted a 3-5 record with a 4.63
ERA in 26 games both as a starter and in relief.

2008
After the oft-injured right-hander passes a physical taken earlier in the
week, the Indians sign free-agent Kerry Wood (5-4, 3.26) to a two-year
deal with a one-year option worth a reported $20 million. The former Cubs
fireballing phenom saved 34 games in 2008, his first season as a closer
for Chicago.

2009
The Blue Jays announce coming to terms with Jose Bautista on a one-year deal
worth $2.4 million. The utility player will establish a new franchise mark
of homeruns in a season when he goes deep 54 times, six more than George
Bell's total in 1987.

2010
The Mariners honor Dave Niehaus, the team's long-time broadcaster, who died
suddenly last month, with a Safeco Field ceremony that is attended by his
family, team officials, former players and thousands of fans. The Hall of
Fame announcer, who had been in the Seattle booth since the franchise's
first pitch in 1977, is remembered by Ken Griffey Jr, in a video message,
as a guy who was a class act that meant more to the city than the players.
