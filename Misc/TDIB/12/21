1911
In the New York Evening Journal, 80's player-manager Sam Crane picks
his all-time greatest list in response to a list that Charles Comiskey
compiled. Crane graciously faults Comiskey for not including himself, as
well as for not going back far enough. He lists 20 in chronological order:
G. Wright, R. Barnes, C. Anson, M. Kelly, C. Radbourn, F. Dunlap, Buck Ewing,
J. Ward, C. Comiskey, B. Lange, J. McGraw, L. Lajoie, F. Clarke, H. Wagner,
W. Keeler, J. Collins, C. Mathewson, H. Chase, T. Cobb and E. Collins.

1918
The Red Sox trade hurlers Ernie Shore and Dutch Leonard as well as outfielder
Duffy Lewis to the Yankees for relatively unknown players and $15,000. The
group includes Frank Gilhooley, Slim Love, Ray Caldwell and Roxy Walters.

1935
The Dodgers trade Ray Benge, Tony Cuccinello, Al Lopez and Bobby Reis to
the Braves for P Ed Brandt (5-19) and OF Randy Moore. Brandt will win 11
and be traded next December for Cookie Lavagetto and Ralph Birkofer.

Pittsburgh sends P Claude Passeau and C Earl Grace to the Phils for C Al
Todd. Passeau will have three decent seasons before blossoming with the Cubs.

1940
Chicago writers name Indians SS Lou Boudreau as the outstanding rookie in
the ML. He'll be honored at the January banquet.

1944
NL averages show Brooklyn's Dixie Walker at the top of the hitters with a .357
mark, ahead of Stan Musial at .347. In an even closer vote than occurred in
the AL, the NL MVP award goes to fielding wizard Marty Marion, who tallies
one more vote than Cubs slugger Bill Nicholson (189). The Cardinals commited
only 112 errors, for a fielding average of .982, both better than previous
records held by the 1940 Reds. Marion is the 3rd different Cardinal in 3
years to win the honor.

1959
After Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh rejects the A's offer to deal Roger
Maris for shortstop Dick Groat, Pittsburgh obtains Gino Cimoli along with Tom
Cheney from the Cardinals for right-hander Ron Kline. Maris, who is dealt
to the Yankees, will enjoy the first of his two consecutive MVP years in
New York, but Groat will play a key role for the World Champion Bucs next
season, and he also will be named the Most Valuable Player of his league.

1960
Cub owner P.K. Wrigley announces the club will not have a manager next
season, but will instead use a college of coaches. The 'faculty' for
the upcoming campaign will include El Tappe, Charlie Grimm, Goldie Holt,
Bobby Adams, Harry Craft, Verlon Walker, Ripper Collins and Vedie Himsl,
with each serving as "head coach" for part of the season.

1970
Jimmy Wynn of the Astros is injured during a domestic quarrel. He will undergo
abdominal surgery for a stab wound but will suffer no long-term effects.

1977
Free Agent Oriole pitcher Ross Grimsley signs with the Expos. Grimsley will
reward Montreal with a 20-win season in 1978.

1978
Sports cartoonist Willard Mullin, creator of the lovable caricature known
as the 'Brooklyn Bum', dies in Corpus Christi at the age of 76. The cartoon
featured a low-brow, working class character who would proudly represent
the borough of Brooklyn, quickly becoming a favorite of the Dodger fans.

1981
Twenty-two-year-old Royals pitcher Mike Jones, who was 6-3 with a 3.20 ERA
in the 2nd half of 1981 and was projected to be the club's 3rd starter next
year, is listed in guarded condition after crashing his car while driving
under the influence near Rochester, NY. Jones will not pitch in the majors
again until 1984.

1982
Free-agent 1B Steve Garvey signs a 5-year contract with the San Diego Padres.

1987
The A's sign free agent Dave Henderson, who played this past season with
the San Francisco Giants.

The Dodgers sign free agent Hubie Brooks.

1992
The Rockies sign free agent OF Daryl Boston.

1995
After considering an attractive offer from the Orioles, David Cone re-signs
with the Yankees as a free agent. The 'hired hand' inks a three-year deal
worth $18 million.

The Orioles sign Toronto free-agent Roberto Alomar to a three-year $18
million contract. The second baseman will be selected as an All-Star all
three seasons he is with the team, and the 27-year-old infielder will also
win two Gold Gloves and a Silver Slugger award during his stay in Baltimore.

The Royals send Wally Joyner and minor league P Aaron Dorlarque to the
Padres in exchange for IF Bip Roberts and minor league P Bryan Wolff

The Red Sox sign free agent P Tom Gordon to a 2-year contract.

1999

The Dodgers are fined $50,000 and banned from scouting any Dominican Republic
players for one year as a penalty for having signed 3B Adrian Beltre as a
15-year-old. Beltre is not given his free agency, according to Commissioner
Bud Selig, because he participated in the scheme, and because the claim for
free agency was made too late. The players' association is expected to file
a grievance in the matter.

2000
Hoping to pick it up where his success started, 41-year-old outfielder Tim
Raines agrees to a minor league contract with the Expos, the team he broke
in with in 1979. After retiring in Yankee camp during spring training with
.295 career batting average, he failed to make this year's U.S. Olympic team.

2001
The Red Sox sign free agent speedster OF Johnny Damon to a 4-year contract.

2002
After declining their club option, the Diamondbacks decide to retain veteran
first baseman Mark Grace (.252, 7, 48). The lifetime .305 hitter agrees to
a one-year deal which includes a club option for the 2004 season.

2003
The Cubs send C Damian Miller and cash to the Athletics to complete an
earlier trade.

The Marlins sign free agent P Armando Benitez to a contract.

2004
The Reds sign free agent 3B Joe Randa to a contract.

The Yankees sign free agent 2B Tony Womack to a 2-year contract.

2005
With the announcement Oakland will no longer sell tickets for the third
deck of McAfee Coliseum, the A's home becomes the smallest park in the
major leagues. The seating capacity, reduced from 44,073 to 34,179, is less
than Fenway Park, which has been recently increased to accommodate 38,805
denizens of Red Sox Nation.

After trying to sign the All-Star outfielder twice as a free agent, the
Giants finally acquire Steve Finley (.222, 12, 54) in a trade with the Dodgers
which sends third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo (.277, 2, 43) to Los Angeles. The
veteran infielder appeared in only 109 games last season due to injuries.

2006
The Reds acquire 1B Jeff Conine from the Phillies for INF Brad Key and OF
Javon Moran.

2007
In an effort to replace LaTroy Hawkins' role in the bullpen, the Rockies
sign free-agent Luis Vizcaino (8-2, 4.30) to a $7.5 million two-year
deal. The 33-year right-hander, who pitched for the Yankees last season,
will be used in middle-inning relief by the National League champs.

Josh Hamilton (.292, 19, 47) is traded by the Reds to the Rangers for
pitchers Edinson Volquez and Danny Herrera. The 26-year-old outfielder, who
became a fan favorite due to his overcoming a history of substance abuse,
played in 90 games for Cincinnati and was named the National League Rookie
of the Month for April.

2009
Although he left Turner Sports three weeks ago under a storm of criticism,
Chip Caray says he has been hired to be the Braves play-by-play announcer
on Fox Sports South and SportsSouth. The 44-year-old broadcaster, son of
the late Atlanta broadcaster Skip Caray and grandson of fabled Harry Caray,
is replacing ESPN-bound Jon Sciambi, and is expected to call approximately
105 games next season.

2010
The Yankees have been levied with a luxury tax of $25.69 million for
its spending in 2009. The World Series champion club is the only team to
be penalized this year for crossing the salary threshold, as it has in
all seven years since the tax was initiated by the collective bargaining
agreement in 2002.

The Red Sox and Bobby Jenks agree to a two-year $12 million deal bringing the
former White Sox closer to Boston as a set-up man for Jonathan Papelbon. The
two-time All-Star reliever, who did not pitch after saving both ends of
a doubleheader against his new team in early September, saved 27 games
for Chicago, but lost his job at the end of the season when he struggled
because of difficulties with his forearm.
