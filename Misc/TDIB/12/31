1914
Ban Johnson's efforts to strengthen the New York Yankees succeed when he
arranges the purchase of the team by Colonel Jacob Ruppert and Cap Huston for
$460,000 from Bill Devery and Frank Farrell. After Detroit owner Frank Navin
refuses to let Hughie Jennings go, the new Yankee owners will name longtime
Detroit pitcher Wild Bill Donovan as manager. Donovan was recently manager of
Providence (IL) and was rumored to be Jennings' eventual successor in Detroit.

1918
Kid Gleason replaces Pants Rowland as White Sox manager following the team's
skid to 5th.

Giants pitcher Fred Toney is sentenced to 4 months in jail after he pleads
guilty to violating the Mann Act, which prohibits taking a woman across
state lines for immoral purposes.

1949
The 1940s is the only decade in ML baseball history in which no new stadiums
are built. After Cleveland opened Municipal Stadium in 1932, no new ballpark
will be opened until County Stadium in Milwaukee is unveiled in 1953.

The 1940s will end with 8 blacks on ML rosters:  3 each on the Dodgers and
Indians, and 2 with the Giants. Although it will be another decade before
all ML teams would be integrated, most teams will be playing blacks in the
next 2 years. All but the Browns, Cubs and Reds set attendance records in
the 1940s. There were 81 scheduled night games in 1940 and 384 in 1949. The
change to playing under the lights is underscored by the release of the
1950 schedule. The Cardinals have permission to open the season with the
Pirates in a night game.

1962
The state of Ohio withdraws a suit against the Reds when owner Bill DeWitt
agrees in writing that the club will stay in Cincinnati for 10 years.

1966
After fifteen years with the Braves, Eddie Mathews along with Sandy Alomar
Sr and Arnie Umbach, is traded to the Astros in exchange for outfielder
Dave Nicholson and RHP Bob Bruce. The future Hall of Fame third baseman is
the only person to play for the Boston, Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves.

1972
A plane carrying Roberto Clemente to Nicaragua on a mercy mission for
earthquake victims crashes into the Atlantic Ocean. Clemente, who batted
.317 in 18 seasons with the Pirates, is presumed dead at age 38.

1974
Happy New Year. Free-agent Catfish Hunter signs with the Yankees ending
an unprecedented bidding war. The former A's ace inks a five-year $3.75
million dollar contract (three times more than any other player) to pitch
for the Bronx Bombers. Catfish will win 40 games over the next two seasons
before suffering arm trouble.

1979
The Basic Agreement between players and owners expires, precipitating more
than 19 months of bitter negotiations, culminating in the 1981 player strike.

1984
Despite 6 weeks of negotiations, the Basic Agreement between the players
and owners that was reached after the 1981 strike expires. The players are
now seeking increased contributions to their pension plan from the clubs'
additional television revenues, while the owners are hoping to slow the
rapid growth of player salaries.

1990
A's 3B Carney Lansford is severely injured in a New Year's Eve snowmobile
accident. He will undergo surgery on January 6th to reconstruct the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee as well as repair other ligament
damage. Lansford will play just 5 games in 1991, but return to the starting
lineup in 1992.

1993
Baseball's collective bargaining agreement runs out with no new agreement
yet signed.

2003
Let's celebrate the new year. The Padres sign free agent P David Wells to a
contract as Wells spurns the Yankees' offer. Supposedly, the Padre contract
does not contain a weight clause, which the Yankees insisted upon.

The Orioles sign free agent P Mike DeJean to a contract.

2004
After the Devil Rays decline his 2005 $8 million contract option, Tino
Martinez (.262, 23, 76) signs a one-year $3 million contract to rejoin the
Yankees. The popular 37-year-old first baseman, acquired as insurance in the
event Jason Giambi's (the player who replaced him) health continues to fail,
played in the Bronx from 1996-2001.

2008
The Angels agree to a two-year $17.5 million deal with free-agent Brian
Fuentes. The 33-year-old left-handed reliever, who had 30 saves for the
Rockies last season, will replace Francisco Rodriguez as the closer for
the American League West champions.

Deciding not to shift shortstop Jhonny Peralta to third with Asdrubal Cabrera
moving from second to short, the Indians acquire Mark DeRosa from the Cubs
to be their everyday third baseman. To get the 33-year-old infielder, the
Tribe sends minor league pitching prospects Jeff Stevens, Chris Archer and
John Gaub to Chicago.

2009
The Cubs agree to a $15 million three-year deal with Texas free-agent Marlon
Byrd (.283, 20, 89) to fill the void in the outfield created when an agitated
Milton Bradley was traded to Seattle. Chicago's new outfielder will parole
centerfield replacing Kosuke Fukudome, who will move over to right field.

The Red Sox, a team which has tried seven regular shortstops since trading
away Nomar Garciaparra in 2003, sign Marco Scutaro to a deal that guarantees
the 34-year-old infielder a $12.5 million two-year deal. The former utility
player with the Mets and A's had a career year last season for the Blue
Jays after becoming the everyday shortstop with Toronto in 2008.
