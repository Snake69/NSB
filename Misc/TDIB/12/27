1939
The New York Giants obtain infielder Mickey Witek from the Newark Bears
for $40,000 and infielder Alex Kampouris and catcher Tommy Padden. New York
has high hopes for Witek, the 1939 MVP in the International League.

The Cubs trade Gene Lillard, Steve Mesner and cash to the Cardinals for minor
league blue chipper Ken Raffensberger. Raffy won 15 games at Rochester in
each of the past 2 seasons.

1941
Braves mascot Chief Nokahoma is born.

1943
Future Yankee infielder Roy White is born. The Los Angeles native will play
15 years for the Bronx Bombers and compile a lifetime .271 batting average.

1984
Free-agent pitcher Ed Whitson, 14-8 for the Padres, begins a nightmarish
association with the Yankees by signing a 5-year $4.4 million contract.

1996
Gene Brabender, 55, dies. He was a pitcher and led the Seattle Pilots with
13 wins in their only season.

2001
After 21 years being heard on WABC, the Yankees will broadcast its spring
training, regular-season and postseason games on all-news station WCBS-AM
which is owned by Infinity Broadcasting. The five-year deal with the Yankees'
YES Network, created earlier this year, is worth approximately $50 million.

The Mets continue to stay busy this off-season acquiring first baseman
Mo Vaughn for 13-year veteran right hander Kevin Appier (11-10, 3.57) and
cash. The 1995 American League MVP will join Roberto Alomar, Roger Cedeno
and Shawn Estes as the newest members of the Shea Squad. Vaughn did not
play a game in 2001 due to injuries.

The Padres sign free agent P Alan Embree to a 1-year contract.

2002
The Mets sign free agent SS Rey Sanchez to a contract.

2003
The Rangers sign free agent OF Brian Jordan to a contract.

The Blue Jays sign free agent P Valerio De Los Santos to a contract.

2004
After the Cubs decline the contract option of Moises Alou (.293, 39, 106),
the Giants sign the free agent outfielder to a one-year contract with an
option for a second year. It will be the second time the All-Star will be
managed by his dad Felipe (first time with the Expos from 1992-96).

The Reds sign free agent P Eric Milton to a 3-year contract.

Three more umpires will be rehired by major league baseball and six more will
split $2.3 million in severance pay as part of a settlement of the dispute
that cost 22 umps their jobs in 1999. The umpires will be brought back as
part of a new five-year labor contract, a deal that also settles the nearly
two-year-old grievance umpires filed over a computer system baseball has
used to evaluate plate umps. Bob Davidson, an 18-year major league veteran,
will get the next big league opening. Davidson, 52, umpired last season
in the Class-A Midwest League. To resolve the grievance over the computer
system, baseball agrees that umpires whose ball-and-strike calls are rated
below standard by Questec will be evaluated by umpire supervisors based on
videotape and in-game inspection.

2005
The Diamondbacks trade 3B Troy Glaus and minor league SS Sergio Santos to
the Blue Jays for Gold Glove 2B Orlando Hudson and P Miguel Batista. The
high-priced Glaus hit 37 homers in 2005 while driving in 97 Diamondbacks,
and piles onto the logjam at 3B in Toronto.

2007
Hoping he will continue to be a hot hitter at Kauffman Stadium (.415), the
Royals sign free-agent Miguel Olivo (.237, 16, 60) to a one-year contract
with a mutual option for the following season. The 29-year-old backstop
was the Marlins' starting catcher for the past two seasons, but was not
tendered a contract after Florida acquired catching prospect Mike Rabelo
in the blockbuster trade with the Tigers during the Winter Meetings.

2008
Adding speed at the top of their order and a superior glove in centerfield,
the Reds sign Willy Taveras (.251, 1, 26) to a two-year contract. The
27-year-old speedster, who lead the major leagues with 68 stolen bases last
season, became a free agent earlier in the month when the Rockies declined
to offer him a contract after the oft-injured outfielder spent two seasons
with the team.

2013
The Rangers come to terms on a seven-year $130 million deal with free-agent
Shin-Soo Choo, who will join the recently acquired power-hitting first
baseman Prince Fielder to provide more offense for the club. The 31-year-old
outfielder, who compiled a .423 on-base percentage, hit .285 with 21 homeruns
and drove in 54 runs for the Reds last season.
