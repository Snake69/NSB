Dec 9

1902
The AL announces the purchase of grounds for a stadium in NY, and the
next day the NL declares its readiness to make peace. Led by Ban Johnson,
the AL decides that foul balls will be strikes, except for a 3rd strike.
This is to speed up the game.

1913
On the same day its owner Charles Ebbets is elected to the National League
Board of Directors, the Dodgers offer the Reds $35,000 for Joe Tinker. The
33-year-old shortstop will jump to the Federal League as a player-manager of
the Chicago Whales for $12,000 as Brooklyn delays meeting his salary demands
of being paid a 'commission' of $10,000 of his final sale price of $25,000.

John Tener, one-time pitcher and congressman, now governor of Pennsylvania,
is elected NL president for four years. John A. Heydler is elected secretary.

1923
Traveling to Chicago for the ML meetings, Wild Bill Donovan, New Haven
manager, is killed when the 20th Century limited train crashes. Donovan
was a pitcher for Detroit and respected ML manager for the Yankees and
Phillies. New Haven president George Weiss had swapped berths with Donovan
and he escapes with a minor injury. Phils owner William F. Baker is also
on the train, but he is unhurt. In all, nine die.

1925
The AL extends Ban Johnson's contract to 1935 and gives him a raise to
$40,000.

Cardinals player-manager Rogers Hornsby is named the MVP in the NL,
gathering 73 out of a possible 80 votes. Hornsby was runner-up in 1924 to
Dazzy Vance. Other strong contenders are Kiki Cuyler, the Pirates top hitter
at .357; the Giants' George Kelly; Pirate SS Glenn Wright; Brooklyn's Dazzy
Vance; and Dave Bancroft, who hit .319 and topped NL shortstops in fielding
average while managing the 5th-place Boston Braves.

The AL, which said no to night baseball 12 months ago, okays 7 night baseball
games for St. Louis. The NL adopts a new design for home plate. It will have
beveled edges, the first change in 50 years. The AL adopts a rule stating
that no batter can be batting champion unless he has 400 or more at-bats.

1930
At its annual meeting, the AL re-elects Ernest S. Barnard to a 5-year term
as president. Barnard will pass away next March at the Mayo clinic.

Rube Foster, one of the most prominent figures in black baseball history,
dies. The founder of the Negro National League excelled as a player,
manager and executive.

1931
Baseball owners, fearful of the effects of the Depression, vote to cut squads
from 25 players to 23. Both leagues will stop awarding MVP trophies. The NL
continues to prohibit uniform numbers. As noted by historian Doug Pappas,
the NL loans the Phillies $35,000 and loans Judge Emil Fuchs, owner of the
Braves, $20,000 secured by his stock. Fuchs' finances are such that he won't
even pay the interest from 1935-37, and will file for bankruptcy in 1938,
three years after retiring from the Braves.

1935
The Giants get 2B Burgess Whitehead from the Cardinals for Roy Parmelee,
Phil Weintraub and cash.

1936
The Red Sox trade Bill Werber to Philadelphia for Pinky Higgins.

1939
Wally Moses is traded by the Philadelphia Athletics to Detroit for Benny
McCoy and Slick Coffman. The deal will later be voided by Judge Landis,
who declares McCoy a free agent because of a Tigers cover-up. He gets a
$10,000 bonus to sign with the A's.

1940
The Reds trade 3B Lew Riggs to Brooklyn for 2B Pep Young.

1941
Although having a 3-C draft deferment due to being the sole support of
his family, Bob Feller, last year's American League leading pitcher with
27 victories for the Indians, becomes the first major leaguer to enlist
after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 23-year-old navy recruit
has already won 107 major league games.

1946
The Senators sell veteran knuckleballer Dutch Leonard to the Phillies where
he'll go 17-12 in 1947 and 12-17 the next year.

1947
The Indians pick up Johnny Berardino from the Browns for Catfish Metkovich and
$50,000. Because of a broken finger, Metkovich will be returned to Cleveland,
and the Indians will add another $15,000 to complete the deal. At the end
of 1952, Berardino will drop baseball as well as the 2nd "r" in his name,
and start a successful acting career in Hollywood.

1953
The leagues meet and adopt a resolution to set up a committee to weigh ending
the pension fund in November of 1955. Hank Greenberg and John Galbreath are on
the committee. Broadcast revenues from WS and All-Star games are in dispute.

The leagues raise the minimum salary to $6,000.

1955
The Dodgers send P Russ Meyer to the Cubs for P Don Elston and cash. Meyer
has the best record in history against the Cubs, at one point going 22-1
against them.

The Phillies purchase veteran Frankie Baumholtz from the Cubs. Frankie
will play in 76 games next year without an extra base hit, a NL record that
will be topped. Red Sox Mike McNally, in 1916, played in 87 games without
an long hit, a record Luis Gomez will break in 1989 (as noted by Lee Sinins).

The Reds trade pitcher Frank Smith to the Cardinals for 3B Ray Jablonski.

1965
The Reds deal Frank Robinson to the Orioles for Milt Pappas, Jack Baldschun
and Dick Simpson. The trade, now considered among the worst in baseball
history, was defended by Cincinnati's general manager Bill DeWitt who
claimed the outfield slugger was "an old 30", prior to the future Hall of
Famer winning the American League triple crown and MVP in his first year
in Baltimore.

Former Cardinals, Dodgers and Pirates executive Wesley Branch Rickey collapses
and dies while giving a speech to an audience in Columbia, Missouri 11 days
shy of his 84th birthday. 'The Mahatma', who is responsible for breaking the
color barrier in 1947 with the signing of Jackie Robinson and implementing
the concept of farm systems for the major leagues, is named by ESPN in 1999
as the most influential sports figure of the twentieth century.

1974
Bobby Tolan, traded by Cincinnati for P Clay Kirby on November 9, 1973,
finally signs a 1974 contract with the Padres, leading to a withdrawal of
the grievance initiated by the Players' Association on his behalf.

1975
The colorful Bill Veeck returns. A group headed by him buys 80 percent of
the White Sox from John Allyn.

1976
The Rangers trade Jeff Burroughs to the Braves for five players and an
estimated $250,000.

1977
The Mariners trade outfielder Dave Collins to the Reds for rookie left-hander
Shane Rawley. The southpaw will post a 20-31 during his four seasons in
Seattle, and Cincinnati's new fly chaser will hit .284 in his seven years
in the Queen City.

The Brewers trade pitchers Jim Slaton and Rich Folkers to the Tigers for
OF Ben Oglivie.

The A's and Reds announce a deal that will send P Vida Blue to Cincinnati for
OF Dave Revering and $1.75 million cash. Commissioner Kuhn will invalidate
the deal on January 30, contending that too much money is involved and
there would be a competitive imbalance created. He later sets a limit of
$400,000 as the maximum that can be exchanged between teams.

1980
Giants manager Dave Bristol is fired.

The Cubs trade reliever Bruce Sutter, the 1979 NL Cy Young Award winner,
to the Cardinals for 3B Ken Reitz, OF-1B Leon Durham and a player to be
named. The future Hall of Fame closer will lead the league in saves in
three of the four seasons he is with St. Louis.

The Pirates trade P Bert Blyleven and C Manny Sanguillen to the Indians
for P Bob Owchinko, P Victor Cruz, C Gary Alexander and minor league P
Rafael Vasquez.

1981
One day after announcing that manager Bob Lemon will return in 1982, the
Yankees announce that former manager Gene Michael, whom Lemon replaced on
September 6th, will return as manager for the 1983 season. They won't wait
that long.

The Dodgers trade 1979 Rookie of the Year Rick Sutcliffe, unhappy with his
exile to the Dodger bullpen, and infielder Jack Perconte to the Indians
for OF Jorge Orta. Orta will hit just .217 for the Dodgers next season,
while Sutcliffe will lead the AL in ERA.

The Giants trade OF Larry Herndon to the Tigers for pitcher Dan Schatzeder
and minor leaguer Mike Chris.

1982
The Phillies trade 2B Manny Trillo, OF George Vukovich, SS Julio Franco,
catcher Jerry Willard and pitcher Jay Baller to the Indians for 24-year-old
OF Von Hayes. Hayes hit .250 with 14 HRs and 32 SBs for Cleveland last
season and is considered a potential star.

In what will turn out to be a pair of unwise deals, the Yankees sign
free-agent OF Steve Kemp to a 5-year contract, and trade OF Dave Collins,
pitcher Mike Morgan, and minor leaguer Fred McGriff to the Blue Jays for
P Dale Murray and minor leaguer Tom Dodd.

Fletcher and cash.

1992

Louisville and apologizes for insensitive remarks.

Florida Marlins president Carl Barger dies from a heart attack at age
62. Despite the pall cast over the gathering by the death, the players'
agents scoop up $228 million dollars worth of contracts in the five days
of the winter meetings. Pirates GM Ted Simmons selects lefty Dave Otto
from the Indians in the Rule 5 draft, neglecting to notice that Otto had
a $500,000 guaranteed contract. Because of the auction-like atmosphere,
the owners will terminate the winter meetings for the next six years.

The Red Sox sign free agent OF Andre Dawson to a 2-year contract.

The Braves sign free agent Cy Young and Gold Glove winner Greg Maddux to a
5-year contract, and then trade pitchers Charlie Leibrandt and Pat Gomez to
the Rangers in exchange for 3B Jose Oliva. Leibrandt (15-7) saw his star
fall in Atlanta when he gave up 11th-inning extra base hits in the 1992
WS and the 1991 NLCS. Maddux, who turned down a $28.5 million contract
extension in mid-season with the Cubs, signs for $28 million, $6 million
less than the Yankees offered.

his closer role with San Diego for a month after giving up a game-tying HR

will only spend one season with San Francisco before moving on to the Mets
the following season.

baseman Wade Boggs. The future Hall of Fame infielder will play the final

in 2003.

2003
Kazuo Matsui, a Japanese seven-time All-Star shortstop, agrees to a

The Angels sign free agent P Bartolo Colon to a 4-year contract.

The Mariners sign free agent P Eddie Guardado to a 3-year contract.

million one-year contract. The former free-agent Padres outfielder will be
used as a designated hitter when not chasing fly balls.

2008
Tony Kubek becomes the first analyst to be a recipient of the Ford C. Frick
Award, an honor reserved for broadcasters by the Hall of Fame. Known for
his outstanding work on the NBC Game of the Week telecasts, the former
Yankee and Blue Jay broadcaster has not watched a single baseball game on
television since he signed off the air in 1994.

2009
Andy Pettitte (14-8, 4.16) agrees to a $11.75 million one-year deal to
return to the Yankees next season. The 37-year-old southpaw played a key
role in the team capturing its 27th World Championship going 4-0 in his
five postseason starts, including victories in the clincher in all three
postseason rounds against the Twins, Angels and Phillies.

The Astros trade minor league prospects right-hander Robert Bono, infielder
Luis Bryan and and a player to be named later to the Marlins in exchange
for Matt Lindstrom, who had 15 saves with 17 chances last season. Houston
hopes the 29-year-old right-handed hard-throwing reliever, whose fastball
has been clocked over a 100 mph, can help fill the role of a late-inning
stopper in their bullpen.

The Rangers, in budget mode, deal $12-million starting pitcher Kevin Millwood
(13-10, 3.67) and $3 million to the Orioles for reliever Chris Ray and a

Texas reaches a preliminary agreement for less money with free-agent Rich
Harden, who posted a 9-9 record with the Cubs last season.

2010
The Cubs sign free-agent Carlos Pena to a $10 million one-year deal. The
former Tampa Bay slugger, spurning several multi-year offers from other
clubs, is optimistic of having a big season in Chicago allowing his agent
Scott Boras to negotiate a long-term contract for similar money being made
by fellow first basemen Ryan Howard ($125 million over 5 years) and Mark
Teixeira ($180 million over 8 years).

2013
The Mets sign Curtis Granderson to a four-year $60 million contract,
the team's richest free-agent deal since Sandy Alderson became the GM in
2010. The 32-year-old outfielder, who hit 84 homers in two seasons for
the Yankees before being limited to 61 games last year due to injuries,
is expected to provide some much needed power for the team that ranked 25th
in the long ball in 2013.

At the start of the annual Winter Meetings, Hall of Fame chairman Jane
Forbes Clark announces managers Bobby Cox, Joe Torre and Tony LaRussa will
be inducted into Cooperstown next summer. The trio of skippers, who have
accumulated 7,558 regular-season wins, 17 pennants and eight World Series
titles among them, were elected unanimously by the 16-member Expansion
Era Committee.
