1905
Lave Cross, 38-year-old 3B, is sold to Washington by the Athletics. Cross
set a ML record in 1902 by driving in 108 runs without hitting a homerun.
Cross will appear in 171 games for Washington over the next two seasons
before ending his 21-year career in the big leagues.

1913
The Sporting News reports that 15 men died from baseball injuries during
the 1913 season, according to a list compiled by J.R. Vickery of Chicago
(as noted by R. J. Lesch). The only name given is that of J. Whetstone of
New Orleans, who suffered "a broken spine sustained in sliding to a base";
all other fatalities were the result of foul tips or pitched balls. The list
"does not include a major league player or even a minor league athlete of
sufficient experience in baseball to be widely known."

1953
Jim 'Junior' Gilliam (.278, 6, 63) wins the National League Rookie of the
Year Award. The Dodger second baseman easily beats out Harvey Haddix and
Ray Jablonski for the freshman honor.

Meanwhile, Satchel Paige remains unclaimed on the AL waiver list.

1958
The Dodgers trade minor league infielder George Lee Anderson to the Phillies
for OF Rip Repulski and pitchers Gene Snyder and Jim Golden. Sparky will be
the Phils' regular 2B in 1959, his only big league season as a player. His
152 games is the most for a one-season career and his 119 total bases is
the fewest ever for a player with 500 at-bats. 'Sparky', better known as
a major league manager than for being a 'good field, no-hit' infielder,
becomes the first skipper to win a World Series in both the American (1984
Tigers) and National (1975-76 Reds) Leagues.

1960
Ripper Collins joins the Cubs' college of coaches. The original 'faculty'
will include El Tappe, Goldie Holt, Bobby Adams, Harry Craft, Verlon Walker,
Vedie Himsl and Charlie Grimm.

1975
Arbitrator Peter Seitz announces a landmark decision in favor of the Players'
Association, making pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally the first true
free agents in baseball history. Seitz is immediately fired by John Gaherin,
chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee. After Messersmith and
McNally each played for their team, the Dodgers and Expos respectively,
without signing a contract during their option year, they challenged the
owners assumption that the reserve clause meant one-year contracts were
automatically renewed. McNally, who retired June 8th, will not return to
the ML, finishing with a 184-119 career record.

1980
The Orioles sign free agent OF Jim Dwyer.

1981
The Yankees sign free-agent OF Dave Collins for a reported $750,000 a year
for at least 3 years. Collins hit .272 for the Reds in 1981 and stole 79
bases in 1979.

1985
Thousands of fans, including former President Richard Nixon and Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth, attend a memorial mass conducted by John Cardinal O'Connor
at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral held for Roger Maris. The moving
service for the recently deceased ballplayer is arranged by Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner.

1992
The Mariners sign free agent C Mackey Sasser to a 2-year contract.

1994
Major league owners implement a salary cap and revenue sharing on striking
players. The new provisions never take effect because a ruling by a judge,
which ends the protracted labor dispute, orders that the next two seasons
must be played under previously existing labor conditions.

1995
The Cardinals sign free agent P Andy Benes to a 2-year contract, and free
agent OF Ron Gant to a 5-year contract.

The Brewers sign free agent OF Jeffrey Hammonds to a 3-year contract.

The Cardinals sign free agent OF Quinton McCracken to a contract.

2003
The Diamondbacks sign free agent pitchers Shane Reynolds and knuckleballer
Steve Sparks to contracts.

Three hours before Texas' deadline on Alex Rodriguez, the Red Sox get their
infielder, signing free agent 2B Pokey Reese to a one year contract. GM
Epstein says they'll give up a bit on offense but that Reese is a defensive
improvement over 2B Todd Walker. At 5 p.m., Texas owner Tom Hicks declares
any deal with Boston is dead and that A-Rod is a Ranger for the next year.

The Cubs sign free agent 2B Todd Walker to a contract.

The Yankees sign free agent OF Kenny Lofton and free agent P Tom Gordon to
2-year contracts.

The Pirates sign free agent 3B Chris Stynes to a contract.

2004
Free-agent J.D. Drew (.305, 31, 118), former flycatcher of the Braves,
signs a five-year $55 million deal with the Dodgers. After being traded
by the Cardinals to Atlanta last season, the left-hand hitting outfielder,
known to be injury prone, played in a career-high 145 games.

The Cardinals ink former Angel infielder David Eckstein (.276, 2, 35) to a
three-year contract. The 29-year-old free agent shortstop will replace Gold
Glover Edgar Renteria, who sign with the Red Sox, making the Boston shortstop,
Orlando Cabrera, available to Anaheim, the team Eckstein is leaving.

The Red Sox sign free agent P Wade Miller to a contract.

The Cardinals sign free agent SS David Eckstein to a 3-year contract.

2005
The Yankees introduce their new 32-year-old clean shaven outfielder to the
media. Johnny Damon, one of the shaggy hair heroes of the 2004 Boston World
Championship, signs a $52 million four-year deal to play center field and bat
lead-off with his former arch rivals much to the chagrin of Red Sox nation.

2006
The Rangers acquire P Brandon McCarthy and OF David Paisano from the White
Sox in exchange for Ps John Danks, Nick Masset and Jacob Rasner.

2007
The Phillies sign 38-year-old outfielder So Taguchi (.290) to a one-year
$1 million deal which also includes performance bonuses and a 2009 club
option. The 'So Man', a Hyogo Prefecture, Japan native, batted .406 (13-32)
as a pinch-hitter for the Cardinals to lead the National League last season.

2008
The Yankees reach a preliminary agreement on a $180 million eight-year
contract with Mark Teixeira (.308, 33, 121). The 28-year-old first baseman
joins CC Sabathia ($161 million, seven years) and A.J. Burnett ($82.5
million, five years) becoming the third free-agent to be signed to a big
contract by the Bronx Bombers this month.

The Yankees announce prices for some of the seats at their new stadium for
the exhibition games against the Cubs on April 3 and 4 will match the prices
for the opener of the original Yankee Stadium against Boston in 1923. Bleacher
seats can be purchased for 25 cents with grandstand tickets going for $1.10.

2009
Nick Johnson, finalizing a $5.75 million one-year deal, returns to the
Yankees to become the team's designated hitter, a void created by the
departure of Hideki Matsui. Prior to the start of the 2004 season, the Bronx
Bombers dealt the 31-year-old first baseman to the Expos in exchange for
right-handed starter Javier Vazquez, who was recently reacquired by the
club in a trade with Atlanta.

Verstatile outfielder Coco Crisp (.228, 3, 14) signs a $5.25 million one-year
contract with the A's. The 30-year-old flychaser, who can play all three
spots in the outfield, underwent surgery on both shoulders limiting his
playing time to only 49 games with the Royals last season, who declined an
$8 million option on the Californian speedy switch-hitter.

Darren Oliver inks a $3.5 million one-year pact that includes a 2011
option making the 39-year-old southpaw a Ranger for the third time in his
16-year major league career. The left-handed reliever retired in 2005, but
resurrected his career with the Mets the following year, before becoming
a fixture in the Angels bullpen the past three seasons.
