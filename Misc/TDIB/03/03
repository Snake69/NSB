1940
The Boston Bees sell Debs Garms to the Pirates. Garms will get only 358
at-bats for the Bucs but, nevertheless, will lead the NL in hitting with a
.355 average. Unlike the AL's 400 at-bats, the NL rules state that a player
must appear in at least a hundred games:  Garms will play in 103. Ford Frick,
NL prexy, will clarify this in September when it is clear that Garms will
not reach the 400 ABs. (Pirate teammate Virgil Davis will be the nominal
runnerup at .326, but play just 99 games.) Garms will drop to .264 in 1941
and he will be out of baseball in 1942.

Hulan Jack makes plans for a new 110,000-seat stadium over the New York
Central railroad tracks, on a 470,000-foot site stretching from 60th to
72nd streets on Manhattan's West Side. The estimated cost of $75 million
for the stadium eventually dooms the project and will be a major factor in
Horace Stoneham's decision to move to San Francisco.

The Giants and Indians cancel an exhibition game in Meridian, Mississippi
because of racial violence in neighboring Alabama.

1959
The winning entry in the Giants' Name-the-Park contest is Candlestick Park,

of only 5,193 fans at Tokyo Dome.

2008
Noah Lowry throws 24 pitches before a batter takes a swing in the Giants'
6-4 loss to Texas. The 28-year-old right-hander, who goes through the order

innings start more punctually.
