1901
Phillies owner John Rogers files for an injunction prohibiting Nap Lajoie,
Bill Bernhard and Chick Fraser from playing for any other team - the most
serious legal test of the reserve clause to date.

1907
Popular Boston Americans OF Chick Stahl, who replaced his best friend Jimmy
Collins as manager of the now named Red Sox at the end of the 1906 season,
commits suicide in West Baden Springs, Indiana as the team is barnstorming
their way back from Little Rock, Arkansas. After breakfast he returns to his
room, which he shared with Collins, and drinks 4 oz. of carbolic acid. There
are various accounts for the reason he committed the suicide ranging from
suggestions of a homosexual relationship, Stahl's fragile personality given
to depressions, and a blackmailing pregnant girlfriend of the recently wed
Stahl. Cy Young reluctantly agrees to start the season as Boston's manager,
but there will be three others during the year.

1913
St. Louis Browns infielder Buzzy Wares is "traded" to the Montgomery,
Alabama team in exchange for use of the minor league stadium by the Browns
for spring training. Wares led the PCL shortstops in errors in 1911-12 with
a total of 199.

1927
In a final exhibition match between last year's series opponents, the Yanks
score 4 in the first off the Cards Grover Cleveland Alexander. Then Alex
shuts down the Yanks until leaving in the 8th, and the Cards score 2 in the
9th to win 6-4. Both teams use their regular lineups, the only teams to make
no starting changes from last year's teams. The 4 runs off Alexander are
the first the 40-year-old veteran has allowed in 15 innings of spring work.

1934
In a collision with C Norman Kies, forty-two-year-old Rabbit Maranville breaks
his left leg sliding home on a double steal in an exhibition game against
the Yankees. The Braves veteran is out for the season and will play just 23
games next year. He had broken his right leg during spring training in 1926.

1937
Trying to see if a new "dead ball" is better than the existing one, the
new sphere is tried in a game between the Red Sox and the Senators. The Sox
outslug the Nats, 13-12, as Cronin drives in 6 runs. Last week the ball was
used in a game between the Giants and Bees with much the same result. On
April 12, the White Sox and Pirates will test the new ball, with the Sox
winning 9-6, though the longest hit is a double.

1940
During a 10-1 loss to the Athletics in Los Angeles, White Sox vet 2B Jackie
Hayes catches a cinder in his eye. The eye will become infected and though
he finishes the season, he loses the sight in the eye. In 1943 he will lose
the sight in both eyes.

1954
The Braves manage 5 hits in losing to their Atlanta farm team, 2-1. Joey
Jay wild pitches in the winner in the 9th. Hank Aaron's 7th inning homer
is the only score for the Braves.

1969
The Cubs purchase Charley Smith from the Giants, which had acquired the
well-traveled third sacker last December 6. Smith will reinjure his knee
and retire after a few at-bats.

1970
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announces the return of the All-Star selection
to the fans. The over-exposure of the Mid-summer Classic, two games each
season between 1959-1962, and the lack of fan input prompts the MLB Promotion
Corporation to modernize the marketing of the game by restoring fan balloting
for the starting eight position players.

1976
A nearly completed Mets-Dodgers trade, involving ace pitchers Tom Seaver
and Don Sutton, is leaked by the New York press. The subsequent public
furor causes the Mets to abandon the deal.

1977
The Rangers' Lenny Randle, angry for having been benched during spring
training, attacks 50-year-old manager Frank Lucchesi, sending him to the
hospital with a shattered cheekbone. Lucchesi helped precipitate the incident
by calling the good-natured Randle "a punk." Randle's days are numbered.

The Reds swap Joel Youngblood to the Cardinals for P Bill Caudill. Tomorrow,
they'll send Pat Darcy to the Cards for Mike Caldwell.

1978
The A's release Wampum, Pennsylvania native, Dick Allen, ending his stormy
15-year career which produced 351 HRs, 1,119 RBI, a .292 batting average,
and a .534 slugging mark.

1985
Sports Illustrated's April 1st edition tricks the nation as author George
Plimpton weaves a fictitious tale of Sidd Finch, a Mets rookie phenom who
throws a 168 mph fastball. Staged photographs and quotes from Mets in real
life help to give the story a realistic edge.

1986
The Red Sox trade designated hitter Mike Easler to the Yankees for designated
hitter Don Baylor.

Four days before his 47th birthday, the Yankees waive pitcher Phil Niekro. He
will be signed by the Indians on April 3rd.

1989
AL umpire Nick Bremigan, 43, dies of a heart attack.

1990
A plan to allow starting pitchers to earn victories with only 3 innings
pitched (because of the abbreviated spring training period) is scrapped,
but teams will be allowed to open the regular season with 27-man rosters
instead of the allowed maximum of 25.

1991
Methodist College defeats Maryville, 43-0, to set an NCAA record for
runs in a game. The previous record of 42 had been set by King College in
1902. Methodist scores 15 runs in the 1st inning, and strokes 34 hits in
the contest, including 7 by Brandon Bridgers.

1996
Kirby Puckett is taken to the Ft. Myers Hospital after he awakes with his
vision blurred by what is later diagnosed as glaucoma. He has a black dot
in front of his left eye and his vision is diagnosed as 20/200. Puckett,
who hit .360 in spring training, will undergo surgery on April 17. He will
never again appear in a major league game.

1999
The Baltimore Orioles make the 1st visit to Cuba by major leaguers since
1959, and defeat the Cuban National team, 3-2 in 11 innings. P Jose Contreras
hurls 8 innings of 2-hit, 10-K ball in relief for the Cubans, while C Charles
Johnson hits a 2-run homer and DH Harold Baines drives in the winning run for
the Orioles. The two teams will play a rematch at Camden Yards in Baltimore
on May 3. As part of the arrangement with the Cubans, ML ships a reported
7,500 wooden bats to Cuba, and the Cuban League immediately switches from
metal bats.

2000
The Phillies obtain 2B Mickey Morandini from the Expos in exchange for cash.

2001
The Yankees trade 36-year-old Glenallen Hill, who hit .297 with 29 homers
last season, to the Angels for minor-league OF Darren Blakely. Hill, taking
the place of the just-released Canseco, will go 9 for 66, spend 5 weeks on
the DL, and get his release June 1.

The Pirates acquire P Omar Olivares from the A's for a player to be
named. It's Omar's 8th team in 8 years.

The Padres give up on P Matt Clement sending him to the Marlins for OF Mark
Kotsay. The Padres also throw in righty Omar Ortiz, a 1999 first round pick.

2002
The Cubs, in desperate need of a closer due to Tom Gordon's muscle tear,
trade pitcher Julian Tavarez (10-9, 4.52) and three minor leaguers to the
Marlins for Antonio Alfonseca (4-4, 28 saves) and right-hander Matt Clement
(9-10, 5.05).

2003
The commissioner's office announces teams will pay tribute to the U.S. Armed
forces during the seventh-inning stretch of all home openers by having
'God Bless America' performed. Although the song has been part of all games
since the September 11th terrorist attacks, it will only be heard in major
league ballparks at the home openers, Sunday and holiday games.

Three days prior to Opening Day, the YES Network claims Cablevision pulls
out of a proposed deal signed 17 days ago that would have provided televised
Yankee games nearly three million cable subscribers in the NYC metropolitan
area. According to a YES Network press release, the giant cable company
failed to sign a finalized version of the hand-written document that both
parties exchanged on March 12, but James L. Dolan, Cablevision president,
said the typewritten draft contained unacceptable alterations.

The Tigers released 2B Damian Easley, setting a major league record for
the most expensive player to be released. He has $14.3 million left on his
contract and he breaks the record set earlier in the month by Greg Vaughn,
who had $9.3 million left on his deal. Easley will ink a deal in 5 days to
play for the Marlins.

The Orioles claimed INF Jose Morban off waivers from the Twins and released
INFs Jeff Reboulet and John Valentin.

2005
The Astros get C Humberto Quintero from the Padres in exchange for P Tim
Redding and cash.

2006
The insurance claim filed by the Astros in January to get back approximately
$15.6 million of Jeff Bagwell's $17 million guaranteed contract is denied
by the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. The insurers cite no
adverse change in the 37-year-old first baseman's condition between the
end of last season and the January 31, 2006 policy.

2008
The decision to have manager Manny Acta catch the ceremonial first pitch
from President Bush at the Nationals' home opener is reported not to have
been made by the White House. Traditionally, the starting catcher is given
the honor, but Paul Lo Duca, whose name is cited in the Mitchell Report on
drug use in baseball, instead will watch his manager receive the toss from
the commander-in-chief.

The 24,663 fans at Chase Field give opposing Rockies left-hander Doug Davis
an ovation as he walks off the mound after appearing in an exhibition game
against the Diamondbacks. Prior to the game, Colorado announces the very
popular 32-year hurler will have his thyroid removed after the results of
a biopsy reveal a lump in his throat to be cancerous.

2013
Mets GM Sandy Alderson announces a MRI has revealed Johan Santana has re-torn
his surgically repaired left shoulder capsule, and indicates additional
surgery is a "strong possibility" for the left-hander. The 34-year-old
Venezuelan southpaw, who missed the entire 2011 season due to the injury,
will probably never pitch again for the team, finishing his six-year,
$137.5-million contract with the team, a deal he signed upon his trade to
the team in early 2008, on the disabled list.

2014
Mike Trout and the Angels come to terms on a $144.5-million, six-year deal,
keeping the 22 year-old outfielder on the team through 2020. The five-tool
phenom from Millville, N.J., the American League's MVP runner-up in his
first two seasons in the majors, was the unanimous choice for the AL Rookie
of the Year award in 2012.
