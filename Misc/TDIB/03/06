1906
Rookie owner Charles W. Murphy puts the last pieces of a Cubs dynasty in
place, trading rookie infielder Hans Lobert and lefthander Jake Weimer to

completes the Tinker-Evers-Chance infield.

1907

The Giants announce they will fly to Philadelphia for their opener. But

$16,000, is the second highest paid New York player.

1923

uniforms, and number them according to the batting order. It doesn't happen
this season.

1926
In the Pirates camp, Art Traynor, brother of Pie, and Phil Morrison, brother
of John, are trying to win a place on the team. Pie says that his brother, who
spent the last year in Europe, is a better player than he is. Neither stick.

1938
Brooklyn's Larry MacPhail buys Dolph Camilli, slugging Phillie 1B, for $45,000

arguing with the umps. The Dodgers win tomorrow and split a doubleheader
on the 8th.

1945
In some of the fiercest fighting of World War II, Harry O'Neill is killed
in the battle for Iwo Jima. In 1939, the fallen Marine played one game in
the major leagues appearing with the A's as a catcher.

1948
The Braves acquire All-Star second baseman Eddie Stanky from the Dodgers
for Bama Rowell, minor leaguer Ray Sanders and $60,000. The hard-nosed

1969
Two spring training games today use experimental rules. DPHers Ty Cline
(Expos) and George Spriggs (Royals) both bat ninth and go 0 for 4 in Fort
Myers. John Orsino (Yankees) bats 6th (1 for 4) and Jim French (Senators)
bats 9th (0 for 3) in Pompano Beach. Orsino has the first hit as a DPH. Five
of the nine games on March 7 use the DPH. The Angels' Dick Stuart reaches base
4 times against the Padres and the boxscore has 3 different pinch-runners for
him (none scored). Boog Powell is the Orioles' DPH (hit 9th) and doubles in
the 5th. The PR, Stanley Martin, scores, and Powell singles in the winning run
in the 7th to beat the Twins, 2-1. The DPH idea will be dropped on March 26.

1971
Joe Cronin, the AL president, gives into A's owner Charlie Finley's request
to allow three balls, rather than four, to constitute a base on balls
during an exhibition game against the Brewers. The experiment, designed
to add offense and speed up the game, proves to be tedious for both teams
when 19 walks are issued as well as six homers being drilled during the
13-9 spring training victory for Oakland.

1973
In a spring training game against the Pirates, Larry Hisle becomes the
first designated hitter in major league history. The contention that the

Special Veterans Committee.

1987
Free agent Andre Dawson signs a one-year contract with the Cubs for the
bargain-basement price of $650,000. Dawson, who had offered to sign a

natural grass at Wrigley Field and save his fragile knees, will hit 49
homeruns and win the NL MVP Award this season.

1992
Yankees P Pascual Perez is suspended for one year for violation of baseball's
drug policy.

1993

Smith, a pitching standout in the Negro League with the Kansas City Monarchs.

Making a comeback after sitting out a year with Lupus, Montreal OF Tim
Raines plays in the same exhibition game as his son, Tim Jr, an outfielder
with the Baltimore Orioles. Tim gets 2 hits, while Tim Jr gets one as the
Orioles win the game, 7-6. Each Raines drives in a run.

2005
Making her debut with John Sterling on WCBS-AM (880), the radio flagship of
the Yankees, Suzyn Waldman becomes the first woman to be a full-time color
commentator in big league history. The former radio-talk host on WFAN, the
first all-sports radio station in the country, was also the first female
to broadcast on a nationally shown baseball telecast as well as the first
to provide local TV (Yankees) major league play-by-play.

2006
The former Minnesota Twins outfielder and member of the Hall of Fame,
Kirby Puckett, suffered a massive brain hemorrhage the previous day,
and died after surgery to relieve the pressure in Phoenix, Arizona at 45
years of age. Puckett (5' 8" 210 lbs) was forced to retire in 1996 after
waking up one morning blind in one eye. At that time he said "I was told
I would never make it because I'm too short. Well, I'm still too short,
but I've got 10 All-Star Games, two World Series championships, and I'm a
very happy and contented guy. It doesn't matter what your height is, it's
what's in your heart." Born in Chicago, Puckett finished his 12-year career
with a lifetime .318 average, and despite a shortened career finished with
over 2,000 hits and 1,000 RBI's.
