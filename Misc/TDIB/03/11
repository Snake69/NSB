themselves from organized ball for a year to regain their eligibility. The six
are Bill Haeffner, Pittsburgh; Ray Demmitt, St. Louis Browns; D.J. Hickman,
Jim Caton, Norman Plitt, George Dumont, all of Brooklyn. All are taken to

returned to the eligibility list. Both were on the voluntarily retired list.
