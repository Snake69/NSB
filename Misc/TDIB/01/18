when the last strike occurred and it hurt the game." Bush, once managing
partner of the Texas Rangers left the job to run for governor in 1994. The
team was sold in 1998. "I can just say loud and clear, I hope there's not
a strike. But it's going to be up to the participants ... they shouldn't
be looking to me. They need to get this settled themselves." He suggests,
"Get rid of arbitration if possible and have, maybe, free agency occur at
an earlier time, and if there's three shortstops and two bidders the price
goes down, and vice versa, it goes up."

League MVP in 2006.

The Tigers avoid arbitration with their new third baseman when Miguel

winter meetings last month.

The A's sign Joe Blanton (14-10, 3.95) to a $3.7 million, one-year deal

the American League comeback player of the year signs a $24+ million,
three-year deal.

Hairston and the grandchildren of Sammy Hairston, who played in four games

on his contract, but he believes Kansas City has been fair to him and does
not want to take the club's money when he is unable to pitch effectively.

three-year deal. The all-star right-handed reliever, who led the AL in
