he'll retire next season.

$866,000 profit in 2 years.

streak for this honor which was first awarded in 1952.

1982
The Cubs trade Ivan DeJesus to the Phillies in exchange for Larry Bowa and a

a 4-6 record with 4.40 ERA.

1999

million contract making his salary $900,000 more than the right-hander would
have earned under the $3.3 million contract offer voided in November. The
fireballer's previous contract gave him the right to terminate the deal
once he became eligible for salary arbitration.

The multi-player deal between Boston and Cleveland, held up by Guillermo
Mota's physical results, caused the delay of another trade in which the
Indians was to get Jason Michaels from the Phillies, and Commissioner Bud
Selig's needed approval of any transaction worth at least $1 million, is
finally completed. Eight players are exchanged including Indians outfielder
Coco Crisp, reliever David Riske and backstop Josh Bard going to Red Sox for
recently acquired third base prospect Andy Marte, catcher Kelly Shoppach,
and cash considerations or a player to be named later.

Nobuhiko Matsunaka agrees to a seven-year contract making it the longest deal

in place of the circular logo used during the past few seasons.

The Phillies send OF Jason Michaels to the Indians for P Arthur Rhodes.

could be increased to $22 million if the Rockies exercise their options in
2013 and 2014. In his first full season, the 25-year-old Dominican right
hander led the pitching staff with 172 strikeouts while posting a 12-12
record with an ERA of 3.99.

John Updike, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and life-long Red Sox fan,
dies of lung cancer at the age of 76. After attending Ted Williams' last
game, the Massachusetts native was inspired to write, Hub Fans Bid Kid
Adieu, ending the famous 1960 essay with, "Gods do not answer letters,"
as an explanation of why the 41-year-old superstar did not acknowledge the
Fenway faithful after homering in his final major league game.

The Brewers sign Craig Counsell as free agent.

2010
Joining Honus Wagner, Willie Stargell, and former teammate Roberto Clemente,
former Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski will have a statue of himself
placed outside of PNC Park. The 12-foot statue, designed by Pittsburgh
sculptor Susan Wagner, will depict the Hall of Fame infielder rounding second
base, with his batting helmet raised high in his right hand, after hitting the
walk-off homer that beat the Yankees in the 1960 Fall Classic, commemorating
the only game 7 World Series-ending round-tripper in the history of the game.
