1953
The Hall of Fame passes over Joe DiMaggio in his first year of eligibility
and elects P Dizzy Dean and OF Al Simmons to Cooperstown. Dean gathers 209

(10th). All will eventually make it.

1958
In an effort to fill the void of Dodger and Giant baseball in the Big Apple,
the Phillies agree to televise 78 games in the New York City area which
is without National League baseball for the first time since the league's
inception in 1876.

1960
Stan Musial asks for, and receives, a pay cut from $100,000 to $80,000 a

their case of keeping the Braves in Milwaukee through the entire upcoming

The Commissioner's office announces life-time passes to any major or minor

returning from Viet Nam.

years with the Orioles, signs with the Atlanta Braves.

The National Labor Relations Board refuses to overturn the election which
removed Richie Phillips and the Major League Umpires Association from

Bill Pulsipher from the Brewers in exchange for IF Luis Lopez.

2001

will be turned on only for stadium events.

2002
In a complicated three-team deal, the Colorado Rockies trade Alex Ochoa and 2
prospects to the Mets for veterans Benny Agbayani and Todd Zeile. The Rocks
will pay $2 mil of Zeile's $6 million contract, while the Mets agree to pay
$3.25 million of it, plus a $500,000 buyout payment on the contract. The
3rd team in the deal, the Brewers, chip in $250,000 of Zeile's pay. The Mets
receive minor leaguers Ross Gload and Craig House from Colorado. The Brewers
then send slugger Jeremy Burnitz, starter Jeff D'Amico, INF Lou Collier,
and 2 prospects to the Mets. New York ships pinchhitter/IF Lenny Harris,
P Glendon Rusch, and Ochoa to Milwaukee. The Mets have now replaced half
of their 2001 roster.

2005
After asking for $22 million in salary arbitration, Roger Clemens agrees
to a one-year, 18 million deal with the Astros. The pact makes the 'Rocket'
the most expensive hurler in major league history.

The Orioles sign free agent P Steve Reed to a contract.

2006
The Orioles acquire a potential No. 1 starting pitcher as the team trades
right-handers Jorge Julio and John Maine to the Mets for Kris Benson (10-8,
4.13) and Kris' wife. (Anna will file for divorce in March, saying her
marriage to Kris is "irretrievably broken", then reverse her call a few
weeks later.) With Jae Seo being dealt to the Dodgers for relievers Duaner
Sanchez and Steve Schmoll, it's the second time this month, the Mets ship
a starter from their pitching rotation in an effort to bolster their bullpen.

2008
Yadier Molina (.275, 6, 40) agrees to a $15.5 million, four-year deal to
remain with the Cardinals. The Redbirds catcher, best known for his defensive
prowess, nailed 23 of 46 base runners trying to steal a base last season.

Brett Tomko and the Royals agree to a $3 million, one-year deal. Kansas
City believes the 34-year-old right-hander has overcome the problems which
plague him with the Dodgers (2-11, 5.80) last season.

2009
In an effort to increase attendance, Washington reduces individual ticket
prices on 14,000 seats and does not raise prices on any of the 41,888 seats
at Nationals Park. Despite the debut of a brand new stadium in the nation's
captiol, the club ranked 13th in attendance in the 16-team National League
circuit.

The Orioles and Nick Markakis finalize a significant $66.1 million six-year
deal, which covers the span the right fielder would have been eligible for
arbitration and the first three years after he would be eligible to file for
free agency. The 25-year-old fly chaser, who had his best offensive season
with the team and led the American League in outfield assists last season,
was named the team's most valuable player by the local media last season.

Avoiding salary arbitration with the Mariners, Erik Bedard agrees to a
$7.75 million, one-year contract. The deal gives the left-hander, the
team's Opening day starter who was obtained last season from Baltimore,
a raise of $750,000 from last season.

Jon Lester becomes the 48th recipient of the Hutch Award, and the first
to be actually treated by a doctor from the renowned institution named for
Seattle baseball legend Fred Hutchinson. The Red Sox hurler, a survivor of
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, is honored with the annual award for best
exemplifying the spirit and competitive drive of the former major leaguer
and skipper, who died in 1964 at the age of 45 of cancer.

2010
Avoiding an arbitration hearing, Joe Blanton (2-8, 4.05) and the Phillies
come to terms on a $24 million, three-year deal. The 29-year-old right-hander
is expected to be the National League champion's number three starter in
a rotation which includes Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels, and J.A. Happ

In an effort to be a closer, Octavio Dotel (3-3, 3.32 ERA) agrees to a
$3.5 million, one-year deal with the Pirates, the only team that offered
the right-hander the opportunity to save games. The 36-old year reliever,
who hasn't been a closer since 2007 with the Kansas City, struck out 75
batters in 62.1 innings in a setup role for the White Sox last season,
but didn't record a save.

2012
After picking up his $6 million option in October, the Red Sox trade Marco
Scutaro (.299, 7, 54) to the Rockies for right-hander Clayton Mortensen
(2-4, 3.86). The unexpected move of the 36-year-old infielder to Colorado,
may be a signal that Boston is counting on prospect Jose Iglesias to be
the starting shortstop on Opening Day.

2015
The Nationals introduce Max Scherzer, the newest member of the team's
already very solid pitching staff. The 29-year-old right-hander, who inked
a seven-year $210 million contract to hurl for Washington, joins Stephen
Strasburg, Jordan Zimmermann, Doug Fister and Gio Gonzalez, a fivesome many
consider to be the best starting rotation in baseball history.
