1909
Minor leaguer Nicholas Mathewson, brother of Christy, commits suicide by
shooting himself at age 22.

1912
Former Brooklyn P Elmer Stricklett, said to be the inventor of the spitball,
is reinstated by the National Commission after playing outside organized
baseball for 3 years. But he does not make it back to the major leagues.

1927
Washington veteran SS Roger Peckinpaugh is traded to the White Sox for P
Sloppy Thurston and Leo Mangum.

1934
Babe Ruth accepts a cut of $17,000 and signs a 1934 contract for $35,000.

1936
Horace Stoneham becomes president of the New York Giants succeeding his dad,
Charles, who died nine days ago. The 32-year-old will hold the position
for the next 40 years before selling the team to Bob Lurie and Bud Herseth
in 1976.

IRS figures for 1934 show Branch Rickey as the highest paid man in baseball
at $49,470. Commissioner Landis had voluntarily taken a cut in 1933 from
$65,000 to $40,000 because of the Depression.

The Chunichi Dragons of Nagoya, Japan, are officially formed. Eight days
later the Hankyu Braves of Nishinomiya are formed.

1942
In his famous 'Green Light letter', President Franklin D. Roosevelt answers
Commissioner Landis' query about playing baseball in the wake of the second
World War. FDR responds "I honestly think it would be best for the country
to keep baseball going." He encourages the owners to have more games at
night to give war workers an opportunity to attend games.

The Cubs, who had signed contracts to install lights at Wrigley Field,
drop their plans because of the military needs for the material.

1957
The Kratter Corporation grants Walter O'Malley an additional two years on
the three-year lease on Ebbets Field agreed to last year. Marvin Kratter
bought the field in 1953. The new agreement means the ball club has a
home in Brooklyn until 1961, but may have been prompted by the Dodgers'
owner's uncertainty about L.A.'s ability to secure the land needed to built
a stadium if the team moved to the West Coast.

1958
In a deal worth over a million dollars, the Yankees announce that they will
televise 140 games in the 1958 season. Six days later, the Phillies agree
to televise 78 games into the New York City area.

1959
The Texas League votes to issue automatic intentional walks instead of
throwing 4 wide pitches.

1964
Willie Mays, the highest paid player in baseball, signs the $105,000 contract
offered by the Giants. The perennial all-star center fielder will have
another outstanding season batting .308, hitting 40 homeruns and driving
in 123 runs for the Jints.

ML baseball executives vote to hold a free-agent draft in New York City. A
new TV pact is also signed.

1965
The Mets trade OF George Altman back to his original team, the Cubs, for
OF Billy Cowan.

1967
Tom Brown becomes the first major leaguer to play in the Super Bowl. The
Green Bay defensive back, an outfielder and first baseman for the Senators
in 1963, is best remembered for his last-minute interception of Cowboys'
Don Meridith's Hail Mary pass in the NFL Championship game, making Green
Bay a participant in the first-ever Super Bowl.

1970
The Oakland Athletics trade C Phil Roof, OF Mike Hershberger and pitchers
Lew Krausse and Ken Sanders to the Brewers for 1B Don Mincher and infielder
Ron Clark. It is the Brewers' first trade.

1981
Receiving 337 votes of the 401 BBWAA ballots cast (84%) in his first year of
eligibility, Cardinal right-hander Bob Gibson is the only player elected to
the Hall of Fame this year. Players falling short of the 301 votes needed
for election include well-known Dodgers Don Drysdale (243) and Gil Hodges
(241) as well as Twins slugger Harmon Killebrew (239), Hoyt Wilhelm (238),
and Juan Marichal (233).

1990
Returning from a stint in Japan where he hit 38 homers for the Hanshin Tigers,
former Blue Jay Cecil Fielder signs a free-agent deal worth $1,250,000 with
the Tigers. 'Big Daddy' will hit 245 homeruns and drive in 758 runs during
his seven seasons with Detroit.

1993
The Blue Jays sign free agent SS Dick Schofield to a contract.

1994
At its winter fan festival, Milwaukee unveils a new logo and different team
colors with navy, green and metallic gold replacing the current royal blue
and yellow. The changes, the first since the start of the 1978 season, also
include Germanic lettering in place of the standard block, and the addition
of the first alternate uniform in the club's history, a navy jersey with
the club's primary logo below the word Brewers across the chest.

1998
The Cubs sign burly free agent P Rod Beck to a 1-year contract.

1999
The Orioles sign free agent P Heathcliff Slocumb.

The Cardinals sign free agent P Mike Mohler.

2002
The Braves trade outfielder Brian Jordan (.295, 25, 97), pitcher Odalis Perez
(7-8, 4.91), and minor league P Andy Brown to the Dodgers to acquire All-Star
outfielder Gary Sheffield (.311, 36, 100). The deal ends Sheffield's stormy
tenure with L.A.

The Phillies sign free agent P Terry Adams to a 1-year contract.

2003
In a 3-team deal, the White Sox obtain 20-game winner Bartolo Colon from
the Expos. The Yankees send P Orlando Hernandez and $2 million to Chicago
for Ps Antonio Osuna and Delvis Lantigua. The Sox then sent Hernandez,
P Rocky Biddle, OF Jeff Liefer, and cash to Montreal for Colon and minor
league IF Jorge Nunez.

The Rangers sign free agent P Ismael Valdes to a contract.

The White Sox sign free agent OF Armando Rios to a contract.

2008
At the Congressional hearing concerning the Mitchell Report, Representatives
Henry Waxman and Tom Davis, announce they have sent a letter to Attorney
General Michael Mukasey to investigate if Miguel Tejada lied to House
committee staff when questioned about Oriole teammate Rafael Palmeiro's use
of steroids. The former American League MVP, who was traded to the Astros
in the off season, could face jail time, if found guilty, because making
false statements to Congress is a felony.

2009
Derek Lowe signs a four-year deal with the Braves reportedly worth $60
million. The 35-year-old right-hander will be the ace of Atlanta's new look
rotation of Jair Jurrjens and newly acquired Javier Vazquez and Kenshin
Kawakami, who pitched in Japan last season for the Chunichi Dragons.

Avoiding arbitration, Dave Bush and the Brewers agree to a $4 million,
one-year deal. The 29-year-old right-hander finished the season strong
posting a 7-3 record with a 3.23 ERA in his final 18 regular season starts,
and was the only Milwaukee pitcher to win a postseason game.

The Padres sign 33-year-old veteran infielder David Eckstein to a one-year
contract. The 2006 World Series MVP split last season playing 94 games with
the Blue Jays and Diamondbacks.

The Dodgers, who had restructured Andruw Jones' contract earlier in the month,
put their expensive center fielder on waivers rather than pursuing a trade
for the five-time All-Star. The highest-paid player in franchise history,
who signed a two-year $36.2 million deal during the 2007 offseason, was a
complete bust in his one season with the team hitting a meager .158 with
just three homeruns and 14 RBIs in 209 at-bats.

2010
The Mets and John Maine (7-6, 4.43) come to terms on a one-year, $3.3
million deal just after the right-hander filed for arbitration. New York's
projected number three starter was limited to 15 games last season, due to
the lingering weakness from a 2008 surgery that removed a bony growth from
the socket his right shoulder.

Avoiding salary arbitration, Matt Kemp (.297, 26, 101) and the Dodgers
agree to a rare multi-year offer that will pay the center fielder $10.95
million over the next two seasons. The 25-year-old Oklahoman, considered a
core player in the team's future, won the Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger
awards playing for the National League West champs last season.

2013
After watching their bullpen implode in the NLDS last season, the Nationals
sign Rafael Soriano to a two-year $28 million deal to be the club's
closer. The 33-year-old right-handed reliever, who had a league-leading 45
saves for the Rays in 2011, filled in for the injured Mariano Rivera last
season and saved 42 games for the Yankees.
