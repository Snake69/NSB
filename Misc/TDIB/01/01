In a decision which foreshadows a major blow to Detroit's farm system,
Kenesaw Mountain Landis voids the last month's trade which would have sent
Tiger hurler George Coffman and second baseman Benny McCoy to the A's for

first czar will also grant free agency to another 87 of the club's farm
hands due to their concealment in the minor leagues.

officially renamed Tiger Stadium. The facility, which opened in 1912, was
originally known as Navin Field, named for team owner Frank Navin before

National League.

2013
A proposal that would dramatically increase the number of plays that can be
reviewed during a game is presented at the quarterly Owners Meetings by a
committee consisting of Braves president John Schuerholz and former major
league skippers Joe Torre and Tony La Russa. The rule change, which will be
formally voted on by the owners in November, will allow a manager to inform
an umpire that he wants to initiate a play review, with challenges being
permitted once in the first six innings and twice more from the seventh
through the end of the game, without any provision to cover the possibility
of an obviously missed call late in the game when all of a team's challenges
have been used.
