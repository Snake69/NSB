In the continuing clash between Judge Landis and Ban Johnson, the AL owners
are prepared to censure Johnson. But his serious health problems convince

of absence instead. Detroit's President Frank Navin is named acting AL
president and the owners adopt a resolution repudiating the charges that
Johnson made against Landis.

1932
The Dodgers acquire Hack Wilson from the Cardinals, which had acquired
him in December. The 1930 HR king of the NL costs only $45,000 and a minor

In a trade that might have been good for both teams, the Washington
Senators trade SS Pete Runnels to the Red Sox for 1B Norm Zauchin and OF
Albie Pearson. Runnels will win two batting titles in 1960 and 1962 and
just miss by 6 points in 1958. With Washington, Zauchin never shows the
power he displayed in 1955 when he hit 27 homers. He will leave the majors
for good after the 1959 season. Pearson will become one of the American
League's best leadoff hitters, but only after the Senators trade him.

cost of $1,597, was supposed to have radiant heating.

1967
Four years removed from the playing field, Cardinal standout Stan Musial

in his first season on the job.

1975
By the slimmest of margins (a single vote), Ralph Kiner is elected into
the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA. The former Pirates slugger, who played only
ten years in the majors and lead the National League in homeruns for seven
consecutive seasons, received 273 votes on the 362 ballots cast by the
writers, just enough to reached the 75% needed to be selected.

1979
Willie Mays is selected by the BBWAA as a member of the Hall of Fame. The
'Say-Hey Kid' receives 409 of the 432 votes cast with 23 writers inexplicably
leaving one of the top ball players of all time off their ballots.

1981
Faced with the possibility of losing star OF Fred Lynn to free agency
because of a front-office blunder, the Red Sox trade Lynn and P Steve Renko
to the Angels for pitchers Frank Tanana and Jim Dorsey and OF Joe Rudi. The
Players' Association contends that Lynn, catcher Carlton Fisk, and shortstop
Rick Burleson are free agents because the Red Sox failed to mail their new
contracts by the deadline provided for in the Basic Agreement. Lynn signs
a 4-year deal with the Angels and agrees to drop his case. Fisk's case will
go to arbitration.

1992
A group calling itself The Baseball Club of Seattle announces that it will
attempt to buy the Mariners for $100 million. Some $75 million of the

2006
With just a few weeks left before spring training, a surprised Dan O'Brien
is fired as the Reds' general manager by the team's new regime. Owner Bob
Castellini makes it clear O'Brien's performance is not the reason for the
dismissal, but wanted his 'own person' in the position.

The Cubs sign free agent P Wade Miller to a contract.

2008
Avoiding salary arbitration, the Indians sign Rafael Betancourt (5-1,
1.47 ERA) to a $5.4 million, two-year deal. The 32-year-old right-handed
reliever was used primarily last season as an eighth inning set-up man for
Cleveland's closer, Joe Borowski.

Kevin Towers, the longest-tenured active major league general manager, gets
a two-year contract extension from the Padres which goes through the 2010
season. Although the club would not reveal financial details, it is believed
the 46-year-old is one of the top five or six highest-paid GMs in the game.

Troy Tulowitzki (.291, 24, 99) and the Rockies agree on a $31 million,
six-year deal which includes a club option for 2014. The shortstop of
National League champs was runner-up for Rookie of the Year.

In an effort to add experience for an unseasoned rotation, the Marlins sign
33-year-old southpaw Mark Hendrickson (4-8, 5.21) to a $1.5 million, one-year
deal which includes an additional $500,000 in performance bonuses. The
6-foot-9 former NBA player has pitched for the Blue Jays, Devil Rays and,
last season, the Dodgers.

2010
Major League Baseball announces the Dodgers, who in 1993 became the first big

League. During their first trip, L.A. played a squad of Chinese All-Stars.

Arbitration-eligible Hunter Pence (.282, 25 72) signs a $3.5 million,
one-year deal with the Astros. The 26-year All-Star outfielder with a rifle
arm earned only $464,000 last year, his third season with Houston.
