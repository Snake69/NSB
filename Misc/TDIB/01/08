1913
Frank Chance becomes the manager of a very weak Highlander (Yankees) team. The
veteran skipper will finish next to last (57-94) and will compile a 117-168
record during his two-year stint in New York.

1916
James E. Gaffney sells the Boston Braves to Percy Haughton, the Harvard
football team coach and a business associate for $500,000. The New York
contractor, who recently gained notoriety as a target of Hennessy and Whitman
investigations into political graft, had bought the team in 1913 for $187,000.

1918
The Giants pick up Jesse Barnes, last year's NL leader in losses (21), along
with Larry Doyle from the Boston Braves. Boston receives veteran Buck Herzog
(in McGraw's doghouse since September). Barnes will go 6-1 this year and then
win a league high 25 games in 1919. Doyle, a former Giant and fan favorite,
was acquired from the Cubs 4 days ago and his trade was rumored. He will
play three years in New York before retiring.

1930
Art Nehf, who pitched in 5 World Series, announces his retirement. He won
184 games in his career, last pitching for the Cubs in the 1929 Series.

1941
The BBWAA in a TSN poll names the 1940 All Star team:  Hank Greenberg, LF;
Joe DiMaggio, CF; Ted Williams, RF; Frank McCormick, 1B; Joe Gordon, 2B;
Luke Appling, SS; Stan Hack, 3B; Harry Danning, C. The pitchers are Bob
Feller, Bucky Walters, and Paul Derringer.

1944
Bill Terry announces his retirement from baseball and his plans to start a
cotton business. The former Giants star and skipper will be inducted into
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954.

1953
Due to the St. Louis owner's refusal to share telecast receipts with
visiting clubs, the Indians ban night games with the Browns. Bill Veeck
did not allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his
team on the road after his proposal to share radio and television revenue
was vetoed by the other American League owners.

1962
Commissioner Ford Frick denies charges that Carl Furillo has been blacklisted
by the ML because of a 1959 salary dispute with the Dodgers.

1968
Jose Lizandro of Marlboro (Panama) pitches a 3-0 no-hitter against Novatos. It
is the first no-hitter in Panama since 1948.

1981
With the signing of Larry Biittner, the Reds become the last big league team
to sign a free agent. The team's first attempt into free agency, which has
been an option of signing major leaguers since 1976, does not go well as
the 35-year-old first baseman/outfielder bats only .213 during his first
year with Cincinnati.

1985
The Padres sign free-agent reliever Tim Stoddard to a 3-year, $1.5 million
contract. Stoddard was 10-6 with 7 saves for the Cubs last season.

1986
Willie McCovey becomes the 16th player elected to the Hall of Fame in his
first year of eligibility. The slugging first baseman, who smashed 521
homeruns and collected 1,555 RBIs, spent most of his 22-year major league
career with the Giants. Billy Williams falls 4 votes shy of the 319 needed
for election.

1987
Ten free agents (Tim Raines, Lance Parrish, Bob Horner, Andre Dawson,
Rich Gedman, Ron Guidry, Bob Boone, Doyle Alexander, Toby Harrah, and Gary
Roenicke) fail to meet a midnight deadline and thus will not be allowed
to re-sign with their former clubs until May 1st if they are not offered
contracts by new teams. The general lack of interest in the players will
become the focus of the Players' Association's first anti-collusion suit
against the owners.

1988
Faced with a midnight deadline to re-sign with the Yankees, pitcher Bill
Gullickson agrees to a 2-year contract with Japan's Tokyo Giants instead.

1990
Johnny Sylvester, the terminally ill young boy whom Babe Ruth promised to hit
a homerun for in the 1926 World Series, dies at the age of 74. Although the
Yankee slugger homers against the Cardinals at Sportsman Park in St. Louis
and the 11-year-old youngster recovers from his undetermined illness, the
accounts of the incident, especially as shown in the movie, The Babe Ruth
Story, have proven to be more romantic than accurate.

1991
Gaylord Perry and Fergie Jenkins, both 300-game winners, and Rod Carew,
the 16th member of the 3,000-hit club, are elected into the Hall of Fame
with Carew becoming the 22nd player to be named in his first year of
eligibility. None of the trio selected by the BBWAA ever appeared in the
Fall Classic.

1994
The Colorado Silver Bullets, professional baseball's first women's team,
holds its first public tryouts in Orlando, Florida. An invitation-only
tryout was held in Orlando on December 18.

1995
Mike Schmidt, a power-hitting third baseman with a total of 548 homers,
is elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA. The two-time Most Valuable
Player spent his entire 18-year major league career with the Phillies.

1996
For the first time since 1971, and only the 7th time in history, no one is
elected by the BBWAA to enter the Hall of Fame. Phil Niekro, a knuckleballer
who spent most of his career with the Braves, comes the closest with 68
percent of the writers' votes, but falls short of the 75 percent needed to
be selected.

1997
The Giants sign free agent P Doug Henry.

2000
The Devil Rays sign free agent P Juan Guzman to a 2-year contract.

2001
Harold Baines, only 145 hits shy of reaching 3,000, agrees to a minor league
contract with the White Sox. The 41-year-old outfielder, a veteran of 21
seasons, will fall short of his goal collecting only 11 hits in 94 at-bats
with the Pale Hose before calling it a career.

In a 3-way deal, the Royals obtain catcher A.J. Hinch, OF Angel Berroa
and cash from the A's, and P Roberto Hernandez from the Devil Rays; the
A's receive P Cory Lidle from the Devil Rays, and OF Johnny Damon, IF Mark
Ellis, and a player to be named from the Royals; and the Devil Rays receive
OF Ben Grieve and a player to be named from the A's.

2002
Turning down the Mets offer, which is worth a million dollars more with no
money deferred, Juan Gonzalez agrees to a $24 million, two-year deal with the
Rangers which includes $10.5 million in deferred payments. The outfielder,
who prefers to stay in the American League, established franchise records
in Texas for homeruns, RBIs, total bases and extra-base hits while playing
for the club from 1989-1999.

Ozzie Smith, a 15-time All-Star shortstop, becomes the 37th player to be
elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility being named on
91.7 percent of the ballots. Dubbed the 'Wizard of Oz' due to his remarkable
defensive abilities, Osborne Earl Smith won 13 Gold Glove Awards during
his 19-year career with the San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals.

2003
Chosen on 85 percent of the ballots cast by the BBWAA, Eddie Murray, the
only switch-hitter with 500 homeruns and 3,000 hits becomes just the 38th
player to be elected in his first year of eligibility. Former All-Star
catcher Gary Carter, best known for his years with the Expos and Mets is
also elected on his sixth try after falling eleven votes short last year.

The Red Sox agree on a 2-year contract with free agent 3B Bill Mueller.

2004
Don Zimmer, who recently resigned as the Yankees' bench coach, is named
as a Senior Baseball Advisor for the Devil Rays. In addition to assisting
the team in community affairs, the 60-year veteran of the game will be in
uniform as a coach during Spring Training and for pregame practices at all
regular season home games and for most road games.

The Indians sign free agent P Jose Jimenez to a contract.

The Tigers obtain IF Carlos Guillen from the Mariners in exchange for IFs
Ramon Santiago and Juan Gonzalez.

The Mariners sign free agent SS Rich Aurilia to a contract.

The Devil Rays sign free agent 1B Robert Fick to a contract.

2005
Free-agent hurler Kevin Millwood (9-6, 4.85) signs a one-year contract with
the Indians. The 30-year-old starter missed most of the last two months of
the season with the Phillies due to acute tendonitis in his right elbow.

After ending a 17-year Fall Classic drought, the Cardinals and skipper Tony
LaRussa agree to a three-year contract extension. The 60-year-old manager,
who piloted the team to 105 wins this season and has been in the postseason
five of the nine seasons with St. Louis, is now signed through 2007.

2008
In his ninth year on the BBWAA's ballot, Rich Gossage is the only player
to receive 75 percent or more of the writers votes (85.8) needed to be
elected to the Hall of Fame. During 'Goose's' 22-year career, most notably
with the Yankees, the reliever compiled a 124-107 record, saved 310 games,
while posting a 3.01 ERA.

Marcus Giles (.229, 4, 39), after a disappointing season with the Padres,
agrees to a minor league deal with the Rockies. The 29-year-old second
baseman was selected as an All-Star playing with the Braves in 2003.

2009
After piloting the team to 100 regular season victories last year and to its
fourth AL West Division title in the past five years, Mike Scioscia agrees
to a contract extension to manage the Angels through the 2018 season. During
his nine-year tenure with the club, the former catcher has compiled a 803-655
record (.557) and captured the franchise's lone World Championship in 2002.

2010
After a solid debut season in Seattle, Franklin Gutierrez (.283, 18, 70)
finalizes a $20.5 million, four-year deal to stay with the Mariners. The
26-year-old Venezuelan center fielder is considered by many as one of the
best defensive outfielders in the American League.

Scott Podsednik comes to terms with the Royals on a $1.75 million, one-year
incentive-laden contract. The 33-year-old fleet outfielder batted .304 and
stole 30 bases for the White Sox last season, after being release by the
Rockies at the end of spring training.

2014
In his second year of eligibility, Craig Biggio misses election into the Hall
of Fame by two votes on the BBWAA's ballots, tying a dubious record shared
by Nellie Fox (1985) and Pie Traynor (1947) for smallest margin (74.8%) not
to be selected for enshrinement at Cooperstown. The candidacy of the former
Astros' standout, who collected more than 3,000 hits in his 15 year career
while playing well in three different positions for the team, has been hurt
by rumors that he may have used steroids, although he has never failed a test,
and was not implicated in the Mitchell Report or in any other investigation.

President Obama, a diehard White Sox Fan, calls Frank Thomas to congratulate
the slugger on his first-ballot election to the Hall of Fame. The 'Big Hurt'
shares the news of his conversation with the Commander-in-Chief during an
afternoon press conference at U.S. Cellular Field, after tweeting his fans,
"What a day!! First HOF and Second Our Wonderful President Of The United
States Called Me!!! #LifeMadeHOF2014" @TheBigHurt_35.

Hurlers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, best remembered for their dominance with
the Braves, and White Sox slugging first baseman Frank Thomas are elected
to the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. It is first time
the BBWAA has voted in three players since 1999 when Nolan Ryan, George
Brett and Robin Yount got their nod for Cooperstown.
