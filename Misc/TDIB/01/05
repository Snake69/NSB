Broadway, which soon becomes a popular and profitable hangout for New York's
sporting life.

1915
The FL sues organized baseball, claiming it to be an illegal trust and
asking that it be dissolved and all contracts voided. The case is filed in
U.S. court in Chicago, before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. He will stall
his decision, and peace is declared at the end of the year. The league shifts
players to beef up teams in key cities. Benny Kauff, the FL's answer to Ty
Cobb, is moved from Indianapolis to Brooklyn.

Thirteen years after a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision effectively
banned him from playing for the Athletics, Nap Lajoie (.258 last year)
rejoins them. With Lajoie leaving Cleveland, the owner will ask several
newspapermen for nickname suggestions to replace the Naps. He'll pick the
name "Indians". A popular myth will be that a newspaper contest resulted in
the winning nickname, after the late Lou Sockalexis, a Penobscot Indian who
was a popular Cleveland player in the late 1890s. The team doesn't correct
the myth until 2000.

1916
The NL, happy to be rid of fractious Cubs owner Charles W. Murphy, allows
Charles H. Weeghman, owner of a restaurant chain and president of the Federal
League Chicago Whales, to buy the Cubs for $500,000. By putting up $50,000,
William Wrigley Jr becomes a minority stock holder. Whales manager Joe
Tinker succeeds Roger Bresnahan, and the Cubs will play in the FL's newly
built park on the North Side, soon to become Wrigley Field.

1920
Red Sox owner Harry Frazee defends selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees for
cash by calling his former player "one of the most selfish and inconsiderate
men ever to put on a baseball uniform".

The Yankees announce the purchase of Babe Ruth; it had been delayed until
Ruth agreed to terms believed to be $40,000 total for 2 years. (Lawrence
Ritter's The Babe, has this announcement on January 6, 11 days after the
deal was consummated.)

1925
During the White Sox and Giants European tour, John McGraw, Charlie Comiskey
and Hugh Jennings are honored with silver medals by the French Baseball
Federation for their efforts of promoting the game in France.

1927
Commissioner Judge Landis begins a 3-day public hearing on the charges that
4 games played between Chicago and Detroit on September 2 and 3, 1917,
had been thrown to the White Sox. The White Sox, Swede Risberg contends,
returned the favor for 2 games in 1919. Near the end of the 1917 season,
some Chicago players contributed about $45 each to reward Detroit pitchers
for winning the last series against Boston, helping Chicago clinch the
pennant. No witnesses confirm any part of the story, although Tigers P
Bill James denies ever receiving any money, and the others named deny all
charges. A week after the hearing opens, Judge Landis clears all the accused,
ruling lack of evidence of anything except the practice of players paying
another team for winning.

1931
Mrs. Lucille Thomas becomes the first woman to buy a professional baseball
team, purchasing the Topeka franchise in the Western League.

1943
In Chicago, the teams agree to start the season later than usual and prepare
to train in areas north of the so-called Eastman-Landis line (named after
Joseph Eastman, head of the Department of Transportation, and Judge Landis),
an area East of the Mississippi and North of the Ohio and Potomac rivers. The
two St. Louis teams are excluded, though they will train in Missouri. Resorts,
armories, and university facilities are chosen for training sites. The
Dodgers will train at Bear Mountain, NY; Cards, at Cape Girardeau, MO;
the Yankees, in Atlantic City. The Red Sox go to Tufts College.

1944
Longtime AL 3B Joe Dugan, hit by a car while crossing a Boston street,
escapes with a slight concussion and a lacerated scalp.

1946
Catcher Walker Cooper goes to the Giants. The sale by the Cardinals for
$175,000 is the highest cash deal ever. The Joe Cronin transaction in 1934
and the Dizzy Dean sale in 1938 were larger deals but also involved other
players. Cooper was considered the best catcher in the game before his
1945 induction into the Navy following a salary dispute with the team.
The All-Star catcher will hit .276 during his 3+ seasons with New York.

The Yankees sign veteran free agent Phil Niekro to a 2-year contract,

to ease the logjam and to fill the void that will be left by the departure
of Rich Gossage, who says he will not re-sign with New York.

The Cubs sign free agent Richie Hebner, late of the Pirates.

1989

Receiving an apology from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner about his 1985
dismissal as manager after only 16 games, Yogi Berra ends his self-exile
from Yankee Stadium and the organization. The Bronx Bomber legend is expected
to participate in future Opening Day and Old Timer's ceremonies.

Nolan Ryan, George Brett, and Robin Yount are elected to baseball's Hall of
Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. It is the first time

The Mariners ink Ichiro Suzuki to a three-year deal worth $14,088,000. The
signing rights to the Japanese outfielder, winner of seven batting titles
in Japan, were awarded to Seattle for approximately $13 million.

The plan to name a new ballpark in downtown Montreal Labatt Park dims as
the Canadian brewery announces the ending of its 15-year sponsorship of
the Expos. The company cites the lack of a local television contract and

Norton to the Rockies; P Mark Guthrie to the A's for 2 years; and vet Bobby
Bonilla by the Cards.

2004
On ABC's "Good Morning America." Pete Rose admits that he bet on baseball
games, though he claims he never bet on the Reds. Pete's book, in which
he admits the same, is out this week. He claims he told Bud Selig that he
bet "four or five times a week, but I never bet against my own team, and I
never made any bets from the clubhouse." When Selig asked why, Rose replied,
"I didn't think I'd get caught." Rose agreed to the lifetime ban in August
1989 and applied for reinstatement in 1997, but Selig hasn't ruled on the
request. In the book, Rose admits placing bets with Ronald Peters through
Thomas Gioiosa and Paul Janszen-the three were the primary witnesses in the
1989 investigation by baseball lawyer John Dowd that led to the agreement
in which Rose accepted a lifetime ban. Dowd concluded Rose bet on baseball
from 1985-87 and detailed 412 baseball wagers between April 8-July 5, 1987,
including 52 on Cincinnati to win.

the Giants. The team's 72-year-old former manager (2003-06) will handle
Major League, Minor League scouting assignments providing insights on
personnel for the GM.

2009
Carl Pohlad, believed by many to be the savior of major league baseball in
Minnesota after buying the club in 1984, dies at the age of 93. Although
the owner of the Twins' net worth was $3.6 billion, the franchise often
had some of the lowest payrolls in baseball, including the World Champion
teams of 1989 and 1993.

Pat Burrell agrees to a two-year deal reportedly worth $16 million with
the Rays, his World Series foes last season. The 32-year-old outfielder,
who spent his first nine seasons in the majors with the Phillies, will most
likely be used as a designated hitter with Tampa Bay.

According to reports, a preliminary agreement has been reached between the
Cubs and free-agent outfielder Milton Bradley on a $30 million, three-year
deal. The switch-hitting All-Star, who batted .321 and led the American
League with a .436 on-base percentage, will fill the team's need for a
left-handed presence in the middle of the line-up.

2010
Troy Glaus and the Braves come to terms on a $1.75 million, one-year
incentive-laden deal that will shift the four-time All-Star third baseman
to first base. After arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder a year ago,
the 33-year infielder appeared in only 14 games with St. Louis at the end
of season.

After 22 big league seasons, playing for the Expos (3-4), Mariners (130-74),
Astros (10-1), Diamondbacks (118-62), Yankees (34-19), and the Giants (8-6),
five-time Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson announces his retirement. The
6-foot-10 'Big Unit' finishes his no-miss Hall of Fame career, which includes
a World Series Most Valuable Player award, a perfect game and two no-hitters,
with a record of 303-166 and as the all-time left-handed strike out leader
with 4,875.

Kelly Shoppach (.214, 12, 40) and the Rays come to terms on a $5.5 million,
two-year contract that includes a club option for a third season at $3.2
million or a $300,000 buyout. The Rays obtained the 29-year-old back up
catcher from the Indians last month for a player to be named, which turns
out be right-hander Mitch Talbott.

In a deal intended to strengthen Philadelphia's bullpen, right-handed
reliever Danys Baez (4-6, 4.02) and the Phillies come to terms on a $5.25
million, two-year contract. The 32-year-old former Baltimore closer will be
used with Ryan Madson and J.C. Romero as a setup man, but could become an
option to replace an unreliable Brad Lidge, who led the majors last season
with 11 blown saves while compiling a 0-8 record along with a 7.21 ERA.

The Mets and R.A. Dickey agree to a one-year minor league deal reportedly
worth $600,000 if the journeyman is added to the major league roster along
with the opportunity to earn $150,000 more in performance bonuses. The
35-year-old knuckleballer will become the first player in franchise history
to win six of his first seven starts (6-0, 2.33 ERA).

2011
Adrian Beltre agrees to a $96 million, six-year deal with the Rangers,
the reigning American League champs. The acquisition of the All-Star third
baseman will make incumbent Michael Young the team's designated hitter,
giving Texas a potent lineup and a much improved defense.

After narrowly missing induction last year, Roberto Alomar and Bert Blyleven
are elected to the Hall of Fame by a wide margin. Right-hander Blyleven,
who waited 14 years before getting the nod from the writers, and second
baseman Alomar, considered a sure first-ballot inductee last year, will
join executive Pat Gillick, broadcaster Dave Van Horne and writer Bill
Conlin in Cooperstown next July.

2012
The Cubs trade Carlos Zambrano to the Marlins for right-hander Chris Volstad
and cash. The 30-year-old right-hander will join fellow Venezuelan Ozzie
Guillen, Miami's new manager, who has been publicly supportive during the
hurler's troubled moments.
