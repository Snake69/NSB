1901
Connie Mack, Philadelphia A's manager-GM, signs a 10-year lease on grounds
at 29th and Columbia to be called Columbia Park. A contract is set for
construction of single-deck stands to hold 7,500.

1904
William H. Yawkey, the 28-year-old heir to a lumber and mining fortune,
buys the Detroit Tigers from S. F. Angus for $50,000. New money and Frank
Navin's shrewd management will bring 3 straight pennants to the franchise
within a few years.

1913
The Giants agree to share the Polo Grounds with the Highlanders for the
1913 season only. The American League club, which will become known as
the Yankees, had been playing their home games at Hilltop Park, located
at 168th Street and Broadway, since 1903, when the franchise shifted from
Baltimore to New York. The Hilltop Park lease expired. The Yankees will
remain as tenants through 1922.

1918
The Yankees trade P Nick Cullop, P Urban Shocker, C Les Nunamaker, 3B Fritz
Maisel, and infielder Joe Gedeon to the Browns for P Eddie Plank and 2B Del
Pratt. Plank, a 300-game winner, retires, but Pratt gives New York three
good years at 2B. Shocker is the gem, posting 4 straight seasons of 20 or
more wins in St. Louis. Maisel, who the Yankees refused to trade in early
1916 for either Boston's Tris Speaker (and cash) or Chicago's Joe Jackson,
will hit just .232 in 90 games and be gone.

1929
The Yankees announce they will put numbers on the backs of their uniforms,
becoming the first baseball team to start continuous use of numbers. The
first numbers are based on positions in the batting order; thus, Ruth will
wear number 3 and Gehrig 4. In a few weeks, the Indians announce that they,
too, will put numbers on their uniforms and by 1931 all AL teams will use
them. It will be 1933 before all NL players are numbered.

1935
The Senators get Bump Hadley from the St. Louis Browns in a trade for Luke
Sewell, who is passed on to the Chicago White Sox.

means it.

1969
After being traded by the Expos along with outfielder Jesus Alou to the
Astros for first baseman/outfielder Rusty Staub, Donn Clendenon refuses to
report to his new team and announces that he is retiring instead. The former
Montreal first baseman balks at going to Houston because of a personality
conflict with the team's newly-hired skipper, Harry Walker, who had managed
him in Pittsburgh. A few days later, Clendenon will decide that he would
be willing to go to one of several other teams, a move which outrages the
Astros. It will be April before the issues are resolved.

1976
Right-handers Robin Roberts (86.9%), best known for his work with the
Phillies, and Bob Lemon (78.6%), who spent his entire career in an Indians
uniform, are elected to the Hall of Fame. Roberts enjoyed six consecutive

record along with an ERA of 3.23 during his 15 years with the Tribe.

1979
Ending a 17-year partnership with Ralph Kiner and Bob Murphy, Lindsey
Nelson announces he will not be returning to the Mets broadcast booth
this season. The colorfully-clad Hall of Fame announcer will eventually do
play-by-play for the Giants.

1982
Free agent Reggie Jackson signs a four-year, nearly four-million dollar
contract with the Angels ending his five-year roller coaster ride with the
Yankees. During his tenure in New York, the Bronx Bombers will appear in
the post-season four times, winning World Championships in 1977-78.

1988
As a result of the Players' Association's 1985 collusion suit against the
owners, arbitrator Thomas Roberts declares 7 players no-risk free agents

given to the Buc player who demonstrates a high level of performance on
the field as exemplified by the late Pittsburgh outfielder.

At the age of 58, World Series standout Tommie Agee dies of cardiac arrest

2003

Twins, to a contract.

The San Diego Padres' new ballpark will be called PETCO Park after the pet
supply company agreed to a naming rights deal worth more than $60 million

and third base, as well as pitched in international youth competitions for
various national teams.

2008
The Mets and outfielder Endy Chavez come to terms with a $3.85 million,
two-year deal. The 29-year-old Venezuelan, who missed most of last season

in game 7 of the 2006 NLCS against the Cardinals.

2009
Jayson Werth agrees to a $10 million, two-year deal with the Phillies
avoiding salary arbitration. With the departure of free agent Pat Burrell
to Tampa Bay, the outfielder becomes the only returning right-handed slugger
to the lefty-heavy lineup of the World Champions.

Rocco Baldelli, traded to the Red Sox in the offseason, takes out an ad in
the St. Petersburg Times to show his appreciation of the support given to
him by the Rays fans during his five years with the franchise. In an open
letter the outfielder writes "I will always think of the Tampa Bay area
as my second home, and I would like to thank everyone for accepting me and
for making my time here as enjoyable as it was".

The Brewers sign Prince Fielder to a two-year extension avoiding arbitration.

2010
The Mets, in need of a center fielder until Carlos Beltran returns to the
lineup in early May, deal 30-year-old right-handed reliever Brian Stokes (2-4,
3.97) to the Angels in exchange for the highly-paid, but under-achieving
Gary Matthews Jr (.250, 4, 50). Los Angeles agrees to pay a significant
portion of the slumping outfielder's $50 million five-year contract that
'Little Sarge' signed three seasons ago.

A's prospect Grant Desme is retiring from baseball to pursue his calling
to be a catholic priest. In 2009, the 23-year-old minor leaguer hit .288
along with 31 homeruns and 89 RBIs playing single A ball with the Kane
County Cougars (MWL) and the Stockton Ports (CAL), and the outfielder was
recently named the Arizona Fall League's Most Valuable Player.

The Phillies and Shane Victorino (.292, 10, 62) come to terms on a
$22 million, three-year deal. The "Flyin' Hawaiian" won his his second
consecutive Gold Glove roaming center field for the NL champions last season.

2014
Twenty-five-year-old right-hander Masahiro Tanaka accepts the Yankees'
seven-year contract offer for $155 million, the fifth-largest deal ever
given to a pitcher. In addition to giving the largest sum ever awarded to
a Japanese player, New York will also pay an additional $20 million to the
Rakuten Golden Eagles, his former team as part of the new posting agreement
between Major League Baseball and teams in Japanese leagues.

2016
The Brewers announces Joe Adcock, who was one vote shy of election last year,
will be added to the Miller Park Walk of Fame. The former first baseman,
who played 10 of his 17 major-league seasons in Milwaukee with the Braves,
appeared in 1,207 games with the franchise, including the inaugural County
Stadium contest in 1953, when he recorded the first base hit and scored
the first run in the history of the ballpark.

2017
Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura and 33-year-old former third baseman Andy

patches that read "ACE 30" on their uniforms during the upcoming the season.
