be released before playing a game and will sign with the Senators on May 24th.

1945
Training rosters list 260 players who are classified 4F for military
service, and quality of big-league play will decline even more from 1944
and 1943. But the flow of players will begin to turn around. Rosters will
include Al Benton, Tigers; Jim Wallace and Tom Earley, Braves; and Van
Mungo of the Giants as players return from the military.

The Yankees are sold by the Ruppert estate to Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping,
and Del Webb for $2.8 million. For that price the trio obtains 400 players,
266 of them in military service, Yankee Stadium, parks in Newark and Kansas
City, and leases on other minor league ballparks. Jake Ruppert, who died in
1939, paid more than the new purchase price for the ground on which Yankee
Stadium was built in 1923.

Five players in the Class D Evangeline League who allegedly bet on the
1946 playoffs are made ineligible. The group includes P Bill Thomas (35-7

in the minors (with 383), 2 Houma teammates, and the Houma manager. Thomas
protested, pointing out that he was 5-0 in the playoffs. He and Len Pecou
will be reinstated in 1949. Thomas will win 26 games in 1950 for teams in
the Evangeline and Rio Grande Valley leagues.

(.529) record with the club.

1966
Due to being recently diagnosed as having three crushed vertebrae resulting
from of a childhood injury, nine-year veteran infielder Tony Kubek announces
his retirement rather than risk further harm to his back. During the last
game of the season, the Yankees shortstop, had gone 3 for 4 at Fenway Park,
including a homerun in the ninth inning, which will now be remembered as
the 29-year-old infielder's final big league at-bat.

1970
Braves ace Phil Niekro undergoes an emergency appendectomy. Niekro won't
miss any playing time, but his record will dip from 23-13 to 12-18.

1973
Receiving 316 votes on 380 ballots (83.2%), Warren Spahn is elected to the
Hall of Fame by the BBWWA. The crafty southpaw, who spent the vast majority

in big league history.

president and CEO of the club.

1983
The White Sox trade pitchers Warren Brusstar and Steve Trout to the Cubs for
Dick Tidrow and Randy Martz, shortstop Scott Fletcher, and first baseman Pat
Tabler. Trout will prove to be a key player in the deal as the left-hander
will post a 43-38 record during his five seasons on the north side of Chicago.

1997
The Devil Rays sign Gregg Blosser, the organization's first player with
major league experience. The former Boston Red Sox outfielder, a Florida
native, will never appear in a game for Tampa Bay.

1999
The Oakland A's sign former Yankee free-agent outfielder Tim Raines for
$600,000. The 39-year-old switch hitter batted .290 for the World Champs
last season and has a .296 career batting average.

After being aired on WOR, Channel 9 since the team's inception in 1962,
Mets games this season will be broadcast by WPIX, Channel 11. The Yankees
games which had been aired for nearly 50 years on Channel 11 will now be

intense bidding war between the Marlins, Mets, Orioles, and Rangers for
the coveted free agent.

2006

two-time American League MVP gives Oakland the right-handed bat the team
needs in the middle of their lineup.

2007
Willie Randolph, who brought New York within one game of a World Series
appearance, agrees to a $5.65 million, three-year deal to manage the Mets
through 2008. The skipper's new deal doubles his present salary expected
this season from $700,000 to $1.4 million.

2008
In an unusual move for the club, the Yankees, rather than waiting for a young
talented player to become arbitration-eligible before negotiating a deal,
offer Robinson Cano (.306, 19, 97) a six-year contract worth approximately
$55 million. The 25-year-old second baseman will become eligible for free
agency after the 2011 season if the team doesn't exercise it option in each
of the following two seasons.

After seeing Torii Hunter and Carlos Silva lost to free agency and being
subjected to non-stop reports of a possible trade of Johan Santana, Twin
fans are delighted when the club announces Justin Morneau and Michael Cuddyer
have both signed long term deals to stay in Minnesota. The 2006 AL MVP, gets
the richest contract in franchise history, $80 million for six-years and
his teammate, Cuddyer, inks an agreement worth $24 million over three years.

2012
Jorge Posada (.273, 275, 1,065) at a SRO Yankee Stadium news conference,

retirement, leaving Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera remaining on the team
from the core group that led New York to four World Series titles in five
years from 1996 to 2000.
