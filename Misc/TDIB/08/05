1901
In Baltimore's 9-0 win in game 2 against Boston, Oriole 1B Burt Hart is
called out at 3B on his long hit, and punches umpire John Haskell. George
Winter takes the loss, which follows a 3-1 Boston victory. Burt Hart will
be banned for life as a result of his assault on the umpire. Hart will play
only a total of 58 games in his major league career.

In the first of two in Philley, Giant OF Ike Van Zandt makes an 11th-inning
error and Philadelphia goes on to score 3 runs and win, 6-3. Van Zandt came
on in the 9th after starting LF Kip Selbach is tossed for protesting strike
calls. Christy Mathewson takes the loss for New York.

At Cincinnati, Topsy Hartsel strokes two inside-the-park homers, but they
are not enough as Chicago loses to the Reds, 10-7. Whitey Guese takes the
decision over Jock Menefee.

1902
Rookie Otto Hess, who made his debut two days ago after being signed
during an open tryout, wobbles to a 7-6 ten-inning win in Cleveland over
the visiting Washington Nationals. The Nats test the rookie by laying down
14 bunts, three of which are misplayed by Hess, four are hits, and seven go
for sacrifices. Cleveland SS Johnny Gochnauer breaks his finger in the 3rd
inning when he tries to flag down a line drive hit by Ed Delahanty. Gochnauer
stays in the game and doubles in the tying runs in the 8th inning and
doubles home the winner with one out off Casey Patten in the top of the 10th.

2-hitter. Mathewson strikes out 11 Bucs in the loss.

versus the visiting Browns. The Highlanders win, 3-1 and 6-5.

Umpire George Bausewine is once again in the middle of controversy. He
forfeits a game to the Pirates with the score tied 5-5 in the 9th when the
Giants argue too long over his safe call at 3B. New York will appeal the
forfeiture, but on August 26th President Pulliam will uphold the ump's
decision. By the rules of the day, Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson is
charged with the loss.

The Reds score 8 runs in the 1st enroute to a 19-6 win over Brooklyn. Miller

team, 6-0.

The Washington Senators complete a marathon run of eight straight
doubleheaders, a ML record until the Nation League Braves top it in 1928. The
marathon started on July 27th and 28th with Philadelphia; Chicago on July
29th, 30th, and 31st; and Cleveland for the 3rd and 4th; and today's twinbill
with Cleveland. The Nats lose game 1, 9-4, and win game 2, 2-0.

The Cubs sweep a pair from the visiting Doves, winning 2-1 and 4-0, and are
now 2 1/2 games behind the Pirates, losers today. Mordecai Brown wins the

home. Jack Pfiester shuts out Boston on 4 hits in the second game.

an 8-4 win over Brooklyn.

streak. The Cubs win a pair from the Phillies, 5-2 and 5-4, to get to 8
1/2 games behind first-place New York.

played for the Pirates and PittFeds under the name Barney Kelly.

During the Reds batting practice at Ebbets Field, fans are treated to an
impromptu fight between two Reds, 2B Lee Magee and left fielder Earl "Greasy"
Neale. Teammates separate the two but the decision is awarded to Neale,
who will play just 3 innings today. The Reds then turn on the Robins,
pounding 13 hits for a 5-0 win. Mike Regan is the winner, scattering 4
hits. The Reds (43-51) are in 5th place, a half-game ahead of Brooklyn.

1920
After losing 3 out of 4 in Chicago, the Yanks drop their first game in
Detroit, 7-1, to Howard Ehmke. Babe Ruth supplies the only NY score with
a shot in the 7th that clears a wire fence in front of the RF wall and
bounced back. The ground rule is it's a HR.

1921
The first radio broadcast of a ML game is heard over KDKA in Pittsburgh when
Harold Arlin announces the Pirates-Phils game. The Pirates score 3 runs in
the 8th inning, beating the Phils 8-5. Arlin broadcast the first football
game between Pittsburgh and West Virginia. His grandson Steve will pitch
for the future San Diego Padres.

26th and 27th HRs off of Ray Kolp, relief P Elam Vangilder takes no chances
with Ruth and walks him intentionally in the 11th and again in the 13th
inning. Ruth bats righty against Vangilder. Bob Meusel's single wins the
game, 9-8.

1925
Cards RF Jack Smith charges in for a short fly ball and keeps on running,
tagging 1B to double up the Braves base runner before he can get back,
for a rare unassisted double play. The Cards roll to a 14-2 win.

Irwin Hayes files a lawsuit against the Cardinals seeking $7500 in damages
after being struck by a ball on June 2. The St. Louis Star reports tomorrow
that the petition charges that James Bottomley, first baseman on the team,
"deliberately and with the intention to create a situation known as a homerun,
struck and drove a baseball which hit the plaintiff's nose, causing severe
nervous shock."

1926
Zach Wheat, in his 18th season for Brooklyn, connects for his final Dodger
HR but collapses near 2B as his injured leg gives out. The future Hall of
Famer refuses a pinch runner and, after several minutes, limps around to

to his total in 1927 while in an A's uniform.

White Sox. Chicago C Harry McCurdy leaves half way thru the game with
a broken finger, joining backstops Crouse and Schacht, out with finger
injuries. Chicago presses infielder Moe Berg into catching duty, and he
will catch almost exclusively from here on out. Berg is 0 for 2 today.

1928
In a battle of the front runners, the Cardinals top the Giants, 6-4, in 15
innings. Young Carl Hubbell relieves Lefty Faulkner in the 4th inning with
2 on and gets a double play. He throws another 11 innings, allowing just
3 hits, before losing to Clarence Mitchell in the 15th.

Lefty Grove throws a masterful 3-hitter against the Tigers to lead the A's to
a win, 5-1. Harry Heilmann's round tripper is the only score for Detroit. With
Ed Walsh Jr beating the Yankees in Chicago, the A's are 3 1/2 games back.

in 53 games for Durocher.

1932
Detroit P Tommy Bridges has a brush with baseball immortality when he
retires the first 26 Washington Senators to face him, before surrendering
a hit to pinch hitter Dave Harris. Harris, the AL's best pinch hitter this
year, slaps the first pitch for a bloop single to break up the perfect
game. Sam Rice then grounds out and the Tigers win the game, 13-0. The
Detroit right-hander will toss two more one-hitters next season. The last
perfect no hit bid broken up with 2 outs in the 9th was July 4, 1908. Billy
Pierce, in 1958, will be the next.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants beat the Cards, 6-2, behind Bill Walker's

allows 3 hits in beating the Braves, 9-1.

1936
For the 2nd day in a row, Mel Ott and Jimmy Ripple combine on homers to
pace the Giants to an 8-4 win over the Bees. Ott's HRs, his 24th and 25th
of the year, account for 3 runs; his homer in the first inning is his
3rd in consecutive times at-bat, having homered in his last 2 at-bats
yesterday. Frank Gabler earns the win today.

In a doubleheader in St. Louis, the Browns rip the White Sox, 16-4, in the
opener, beating Vern Kennedy and ending his 10-game win streak. Game 2,

his career, and will win two more this year for the Brownies.

1940
In a twin-bill nitecap in St. Louis, the Browns' John Whitehead pitches
a 6-inning rain-shortened no-hitter against the Tigers, winning 4-0. An

victory. Detroit wins the opener, 9-2.

1942
In front of a crowd of less than three thousand patrons at Chicago's Comiskey
Park, the White Sox beat the Tigers, 1-0. White Sox 1B Don Kolloway's 2-out

lefty Hal Newhouser. Sore-armed Thornton Lee is the winner. There are 7
games played today, and 5 end in shutouts.

Jason Kendall, when Yorvit Torrealba strikes out in the 5th and then is

over the past three seasons he's faced them. He hit in all 18 games in each
of the past two seasons, and the first eight of this year.

The Tigers edge the Indians, 4-3. Rookie P Fausto Carmona takes the loss

20-9 record next season, his last in the majors.

2010

In the top of the ninth, the Twins recover from blowing a 6-0 lead, when
Jason Kubel's two-out pop up lands behind the pitcher's mound untouched by
the Rays' middle infielders for the go-ahead single in the team's eventual
8-6 victory. The odd play, a result of the ball ricocheting off a catwalk
and changing direction 190 feet above Tropicana Field, will prompt a change
of the ground rules for post-season games played in Tampa Bay.

2011
Darla Harlow, a big fan of the Mississippi Braves, is given the honor of
throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at Trustmark Park in Pearl. After

for the past nine months.

much more than the 50-game suspensions given to most players implicated in
the announcement.

Minnie Forbes, the 81-year-old former owner of the Negro League Detroit
Stars from 1956 to 1958, and about a dozen former baseball players meet
