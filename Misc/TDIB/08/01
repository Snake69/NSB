1901
Kid Nichols, in relief, and Christy Mathewson face each other for the 2nd
time in 3 days, with Matty winning this outing. Nichols relieves in the 7th
with the score, 5-5, but New York scores 4 runs to take a 9-5 lead. Boston
retaliates with 3 runs to put Matty on the ropes, but he escapes with a
9-8 win.

1902
At the Polo Grounds, the Cards and Giants split a pair, St. Louis topping
Joe McGinnity in the opener to win, 4-3, then losing 4-2. Christy Mathewson
scatters 11 hits in beating Alex Pearson. In the opener, the Giants have
3 runners thrown out at home in just 2 innings, and 6 runners thrown out
trying to steal or take an extra base. Showing their wide-open style,
Bresnahan scores from 2B on a bunt.

Washington's Jack Townsend walks 12 in a 13-0 loss to Detroit.

1903
Rube Waddell no-hits the Highlanders, except for Kid Elberfeld, who has 4
singles. These, plus a lavish 6 walks, down the A's 3-2, with the win going
to Jack Chesbro. Waddell observes afterward, "If I would have walked him
4 times, I would have pitched a no-hitter."

The Giants, losers of 11 of 13 games, get a big boost today as Iron Joe
McGinnity asks to pitch both ends of a doubleheader. He lives up to his
name, winning both from Boston, 4-1 and 5-2, giving up just 6 hits in each
complete-game win. Five Giants (TSN says 8:  SABR says 5) were nicked by
pitches in the two games, while the two teams combine to plunk six (TSN
lists 11).

1904
Pittsburgh Pirate hurler Charlie Case gives up 11 hits but shuts out
Chicago, 4-0.

1905
The Giants win their 12th in a row, and 11th straight against Cincinnati,
10-5. The Pirates will end the streak at 13 on August 3rd, but the Giants
will win the pennant easily, 9 games ahead of Pittsburgh.

Cubs manager Frank Selee resigns and is replaced by Frank Chance, who is
elected manager in a narrow vote among the players. Selee, suffering from
tuberculosis, had not been making road trips, and Chance has been serving as
road manager. Selee, who fashioned the team that will dominate the second
half of the decade, retires to Colorado. The visiting Phillies overcome a
5-0 deficit to down Chicago, 7-6, in 11 innings.

Cleveland's cross-firing Earl Moore is hit on the foot by a line drive
and limps to a 3-2 loss to the Highlanders in New York. He will limp to a
2-8 record the rest of the season, finishing at 15-15 and win just 9 games
in the following three seasons. Meanwhile, Cleveland "loans" catcher Nig
Clarke to Detroit. He'll be returned to Cleveland, August 11. He's the 3rd
catcher this year to be sold, then returned to his original team.

The Reds release sore-armed Noodles Hahn, 26. In six seasons Noodles won
122 games and led the NL in strikeouts three times.

1906
Brooklyn's Harry McIntire tosses a no-hitter through 10 2/3 innings before
Pirates 2B Claude Richey singles. McIntire allows no more hits through 12
innings, but he is matched by Pirates P Lefty Leifield, who scatters 9 hits
through 12 innings. McIntire, who faced 31 batters through the first ten
innings, finally weakens in the 13th and allows 3 hits and an unearned run
to lose, 1-0.

The lowly Phillies stop the Cubs, 3-1. Chicago will lose just 7 more games
all year.

1907
The Red Sox collect 22 hits in defeating Cleveland, 14-1.

1909
In Chicago, Three Finger Brown pitches a one-hitter in beating the Phillies,
3-0, in the first of two. Kitty Bransfield's single is the only safety. The
Cubs sweep by winning game 2, 7-6.

1911
The Giants sell Turkey Mike Donlin to the Braves. Boston will swap him
in February.

1912
Rube Marquard is fined $25 by the National Commission for pitching an inning
in a semi-pro game in Port Chester, NY on a day off.

Heinie Zimmerman has two hits in the Cubs' 9-3 win over Brooklyn to raise
his average over .400. Bill Sweeney will briefly pass Zim in mid-August
before the Cubs star regains the batting lead for good.

The Giants take a pair from the Reds, winning 5-4 and 7-5. New York has a
13-game winning streak over Cincinnati.

Phillies manager Roger Bresnahan helps in a 4-3 win over visiting
St. Louis. With the bases loaded in the 5th, Bresnahan suddenly jumps off
the bench, yells, and starts running towards home. Slim Sallee stops in
the middle of his windup to Sherry Magee, and the ump calls a balk. Paskert
then hits a sac fly to drive in the go-ahead run.

Washington wins a contentious game over the Tigers, 6-3. In the 6th inning
with Cobb on 1B he takes off with 2 strikes on Crawford, who misses a
Groom spitter, which eludes the catcher. Crawford is automatically out
but catcher Williams throws to Gandil at 1B anyway. With that Cobb goes to
3B. When Groom takes a big windup, Cobb steals home, initially being called
out by umpire Connolly, who did not see Williams drop the ball. The Tigers
leave the field in protest and return after Connolly confers and makes the
correct call. The Washington Post critcizes Connolly for getting it wrong
and creating confusion by conferring.

1913
At Chicago, the Giants win, 5-2, on a controversial call in the 8th
inning. Art Fletcher is called safe at 2B on a steal attempt by ump Bill
Byron, prompting a shower of abuse from the crowd. Moments later, Fletcher
scores the go-ahead run on a triple by Chief Meyers off Bert Humphrey. The
beneficiary of the offense is Christy Mathewson, who wins his 20th game,
the 11th straight season he's topped the mark.

1914
The Braves edge the Cardinals, 4-3, in 10 innings to reach the .500 mark
(45-45) for the first time this year.

1915
The Cubs beat the Phillies, 2-1, when OF Possum Whited misses a shoestring
catch on a line drive by Heinie Zimmerman, Zim circles the bases for a
homer to beat Alexander.

1916
The Cubs and Phillies split a doubleheader with Chicago winning the opener,
2-0. Heinie Zimmerman starts the scoring with a homerun. In the second game,
the Phillies win, 3-2, despite making just one hit off Hendrix. Fred Luderus
has the lone hit.

Dick Rudolph of the Braves beats the visiting Cardinals, 1-0.

1917
The Reds purchase vet Sherry Magee from the Boston Braves. Magee was hitting
just .256 in 72 games with one homer, but will hit .321 for the Reds for
the rest of the season.

1918
At Boston, Pittsburgh and Boston play a ML record 20 scoreless innings
before the Pirates win 2-0 in the 21st. Max Carey drives home the deuce
with a single. Art Nehf pitches all 21 innings for Boston, while Wilbur
Cooper toils the first 16 for Pittsburgh before Mayer takes over.

At the Polo Grounds, the league-leading Cubs win 5-0 over the 2nd place
Giants. For the 2nd time this season, Hippo Vaughn gives up just one hit,
a safety by Heinie Zimmerman in the 2nd, in beating Fred Toney, recently
acquired from the Reds. The Cubs now lead the NL by 4.

The Nationals lose 21-year-old catcher Val Picinich to the Navy. Picinich
had been the starting catcher, beating out Eddie Aismith.

1919
At Redlands Field, the Reds defeat the Giants 6-2 and ex-Red Fred Toney,
and take over first place again, a spot they will not relinquish.

1920
In Chicago, sensational fielding and Eddie Ciccotte's pitching stop the
Yankees, 3-0. LF Joe Jackson robs Ruth of a double when he catches the ball
and tumbles into the stands on top of fans. The Sox contend he dropped the
ball and play the game under protest. CF Happy Felsch robs Peckinpaugh of
a sure double by snagging his line drive with his bare hand.

1921
At Boston, Red Sox pitcher Joe Bush fires a one-hitter, beating the Browns,
2-0. George Sisler's single is the lone Brownie hit.

Paced by two hits and stellar fielding by acting manager Clyde Milan,
the Senators beat the Tigers, 1-0. With manager George McBride out with a
concussion, the Senators are in the midst of an 11-game winning streak.

1923
Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sells the team to a syndicate headed by
J. A. Robert Quinn, the Browns' business manager. The Broadway producer
will always be remembered and cursed in New England for being the person
who sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920.

Stepping in against the Indians' Sherrod Smith in the 9th inning, Babe Ruth
starts off batting righthanded. After taking a strike, he switches to LH
and hits his 25th HR of the season. The Indians still win, 5-3. The Babe
will again bat righty 4 days later.

1924
At Brooklyn, Dazzy Vance (17-4) strikes out 7 Cubs in a row to establish
a major league record - 14 in all - in a 4-0 win for the Robins. It is
Dazzy's 5th win in a row enroute to 15 straight wins. The future Hall of
Famer will lead NL pitchers with 28 wins, a 2.16 ERA, 30 complete games,
and 262 strikeouts, as rare a triple crown for a pitcher as the batting
version. With Burleigh Grimes' 22-13, Zack Wheat's .375, and Jack Fournier's
league-leading 27 HR, the Robins will nip at the Giants' heels all season
and finish just 1 1/2 games back.

Kalamazoo (Michigan-Ontario L) pitcher Haines beats Muskegon, 5-0, and
stops Bud Claney's 40-game hitting streak.

1925
The Yankees buy Tony Lazzeri from the Pacific Coast League for spring
delivery. Lazzeri will hit a minor-league record 60 HRs with 222 RBI at
Salt Lake City, and earn the nickname "Poosh-em-up" from his legion of
Italian admirers.

Brooklyn faces its 10th lefty in 11 games, but pounds out 17 hits against
Cub Percy Jones to win, 7-1. Zach Wheat has 5 of the hits.

1927
The Cubs top the Phils, 6-5, at Wrigley Field. Hack Wilson has a single
and triple to extend his hit streak to 26 games. Tomorrow he will be shut out.

1928
In the Yankees' 12-1 rout of the Browns, Babe Ruth hits HR No. 42 in the
1st, off Alvin Crowder, and is 4 weeks ahead of his 1927 pace. Bob Meusel
also cracks a homer. Winning pitcher Hank Johnson scatters 7 hits and goes
an unprecedented 5 for 5 at the plate.

The White Sox leap from 6th place to a tie for 4th with a doubleheader win
over the Red Sox in Chicago. Red Faber wins the opener, 4-2, while young
Ed Walsh goes the distance for the nitecap victory, 7-3.

1929
Grover Cleveland Alexander wins his 372nd game to tie Christy Mathewson's
NL record for wins (the record has since been amended to 373 wins). The
Cards top the Robins, 5-2.

1930
Fred Lindstrom supplies the power for the Giants, driving in 6 runs with a
double, single and two homeruns. He adds a stolen base as the Giants beat
the Braves, 10-4. Yesterday the 24-year-old collected his 1,000th career hit.

1932
The Indians drop another 1-0 game to the A's at Municipal Stadium, as Rube
Walberg beats Wes Ferrell.

With Earl Whitehill on the mound for Detroit, the Yank's normal 5th batter
Tony Lazzeri goes to bat and, sensing something amiss, asks ump Dick
Nallin who is supposed to be up. The lineup card shows Ben Chapman, but
when manager Joe McCarthy says its a mistake, Nallin lets Lazzeri hit. When
Lazzeri singles, Detroit's Bucky Harris rushes out to protest, but Nallin
overrules him. New York wins, 6-3, but the Detroit protest will be upheld
by Will Harridge and replayed on September 8th. This game will result in
some statistical confusion since the individual records will be included,
but the game will not be listed in the 'games played' column for a few years
(Total Baseball V erroneously lists this game as being played on August 19).

1933
Carl Hubbell breaks Ed Reulbach's 1908 NL record for consecutive scoreless
innings, with 45 1/3, although the Giants lose to Boston, 3-1.

1936
Tex Carleton of the visiting Cubs registers his 6th win of year against
the Boston Bees, winning 1-0 in 11 innings.

1937
Lou Gehrig hits for the cycle against the Browns, as the Yankees win 14-5. It
is the 2nd time he has performed this feat in his career. Joe DiMaggio adds
his 31st homer of the year, and his 3rd in three days.

At Chicago, the Cubs sweep the Giants, winning 5-4 in 11 innings to increase
their lead to 6 games over NY. Reliever Larry French gets the win on Tuck
Stainback's sacks-full single in the 11th. Hank Leiber pinch-hits for the
Giants, his first appearance since early May, following his hospitalization
as a result of the Feller beaning in spring training.

1938
Al Munro Elias, founder of the Elias Sports Bureau and for many years the
official statistician of the NL and IL, dies in New York City at age 67.

1941
Lefty Gomez of the New York Yankees pitches a 9-0 shutout over the visiting
St. Louis Browns despite walking 11 batters, the most ever issued in a
shutout. He allows 5 hits and walks Roy Cullenbine 4 times. A ML record-tying
15 Brownie base runners are left stranded, matching a mark done twice before
in shut outs (May 22, 1913 and July 29, 1931). Not until the Cardinals on
May 24, 1994, will the mark be surpassed. The Browns will set a AL record
this year, with 1334 left on base. Henrich leads the Yanks with 4 hits,
including 2 homers. For Gomez, it is his 8th straight win.

1942
The Dodgers (71-29) top Johnny Schmitz of the Cubs, 9-6, to stretch their
lead to nine games over St. Louis.

1943
Before 51,723 fans at Comiskey Park, the Negro league West team defeats
the East, 2-1, in the annual All-Star game. Satchel Paige is the star,
striking out four and allowing only one ball to be hit out of the infield
during his stint. He also swats a double in his only at-bat.

Player losses to the military have taken some of the competition out of
Cards-Brooklyn confrontations, but the brawling doesn't stop. In the opener
Cards catcher Walker Cooper apparently attempts to spike Augie Galan and the
two are ejected in the 6th inning. The "duster" occurs after Dodger reliever
Les Webber fires four successful balls at Stan Musial. "Each ball seemed
headed straight at Musial and were not the customary wide throws used for
intentional walks" (UP). Cooper, the next batter up, hits a grounder and
tries to spike Galan at 1B. Police are needed to break up the fight and
escort the two off the field. The Cards win the double bill, 7-1 and 5-4,
virtually eliminating the Dodgers and putting the Birds 11 games in front of
the Pirates. Harry Brecheen wins the opener, defeating Curt Davis. Reliever
Al Brazle wins the nitecap, with starter Kirby Higbe losing.

The White Sox tighten their hold on second place with a double win, 5-1 and
15-9, over the host A's. Wally Moses is the hitting star, stealing his 30th
base in the opener, and connecting for a homer, two triples and a single
in the two games. Luke Appling, in the batting race with Dick Wakefield,
is hitless in the opener, but is 4 for 4 in the nitecap. Buck Ross (8-4)
wins the opener, the 3rd former Mackman this week to top the A's. Haynes
takes the nitecap over Harris.

The eight major league doubleheaders today draw 185,199 fans, with the
Detroit at New York games drawing the most at 43,049.

1945
At the Polo Grounds, Mel Ott hits his historic 500th career homerun off Braves
hurler Johnny Hutchings in the Giants' 9-2 victory over Boston. Joining
Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx, 'Master Melvin' becomes the third major leaguer
to accomplish this career milestone. Ott will hit 10 more this season and
one on Opening Day of 1946 to finish with 511.

Irwin Hall is credited with a single when his line drive winds up inside Dutch
Leonard's pants after it hits the Senators' right-hander in the stomach. The
Washington starter may have lost the Philadelphia A's shortstop's batted
ball, but gets the win in Washington's 2-1 victory over Philadelphia at
Griffith Stadium.

1949
At Cleveland‚ the Tribe sweep a pair from the Red Sox‚ 12-2 and 6-1‚
to move into 2nd place in the AL. Bob Lemon coasts to his 14th win in the
opener‚ beating Ellis Kinder. Larry Doby drives in 4 runs. Cleveland RF
Edwards dislocates his shoulder crashing into the fence making a spectacular
catch of Spence's HR bid. Sam Zoldak wins the nitecap. The Sox drop from
1st to 4th place with the double loss ... Cleveland‚ New York and Boston
are each a game back of the A's.

1950
The Dodgers complete the suspended game of June 24th with the Pirates, by
scoring 2 more runs in the 8th to post a 21-12 win, outhitting the Pirates
25 to 8. Roe is the winner over Bill Werle. 12 extra base hits are made by
the 2 teams, including 5 HRs. Jackie Robinson hits his 2nd career grand
slam as the Dodgers score 7 runs in both the 3rd and 8th innings. In the
regular contest, Erv Palica gives the Brooks a 3-1 win.

Acting on the suggestion of Florida International League President Johnny
Burroughs, the players of the last-place St. Petersburg Saints elect their
own manager. Their choice, by a near unanimous vote to succeed Jim Pruitt,
who resigned, is recently acquired RF Roxie Huberson. He is the team's 4th
manager this season.

1951
Congressman Celler denies the accusation that his committee wants a 3rd
ML. He states that some changes with regard to territorial rights will have
to be made.

The Cubs' Eddie Miksis lines a ball to Willie Mays in CF, which caroms off
his head for a double, as the Cubs nip the Giants, 3-2. Cal McLish wins over
Larry Jansen. The Giants come back in game 2 behind the shut out pitching
of Al Corwin to top the Cubs, 2-0. Bob Kelly is the losing pitcher, while
Al Corwin wins his first ML game.

At Pittsburgh, the Dodgers take a 7-2 lead against Murry Dickson, then make
2 hits off 4 relievers and lose, 12-9. The Pirates score 4 in the 4th and
4 more in the 8th, including Ralph Kiner's 27th homer, to win and snap the
Dodgers' victory streak at 10 games.

1952
Boston starter Max Surkont matches goose eggs with Reds Ken Raffenberger
during the first eight innings in a scoreless duel at Braves Field. The
hard-luck right-hander will lose the game when he uncorks two wild pitches
in the ninth inning that allows two unearned runs to score.

The Dodgers waive veteran lefty Johnny Schmitz to the New York Yankees. He'll
be a Yankee for less than 4 weeks before being packaged off to the Reds.

1953
Ben Flowers of the Boston Red Sox sets a ML record with 8 consecutive games
pitched in relief, a mark that will later be surpassed. Flowers finishes
by walking Matt Batts in the 9th and Kinder relieves and loses, 4-3 in
10 innings.

Warren Spahn of the Braves allows just an infield hit to Richie Ashburn in
the 4th in beating Philadelphia, 5-0. It is Spahn's 31st career shutout.

1954
Dodgers Clem Labine beans Joe Adcock in the 4th. His helmet apparently
saves him from a serious injury, but he is taken out of the game as a
precautionary measure. He will appear in the starting line-up tomorrow. Gene
Conley reciprocates by knocking down Jackie Robinson in the 6th and Robinson
ends up scrapping with Eddie Mathews. The Braves win 14-6, their 10th win
in a row, as Conley runs his record to 10-5. The Braves set a ML mark for
extra bases on long hits in 2 consecutive games (44).

1955

Joe Collins hits 2 homers, one in the 1st and one in the 10th, to give
the Yankees a 2-1, win over the Indians, Tommy Byrne, batting 7th, goes
the route to beat Early Wynn. The Yanks trail the White Sox by a game,
with Boston in 4th place, 4 games back.

1957
Gil Hodges hits his 13th career grand slam, off Dick Littlefield, to establish
a new NL record (previously held by Rogers Hornsby and Ralph Kiner) as the
Dodgers wallop the Cubs, 12-3, at Wrigley. This is the last grand slam in
the history of the Brooklyn Dodgers franchise. Koufax fans 11 and gives up
4 hits, including a 3-run homer to Ernie Banks.

Stan Musial hits 2 homers and 2 singles to drive in 4 runs as the Cards
defeat the Giants, 8-0. Jones is the winner over Antonelli. The homers give
Musial 1,140 extra base hits, moving him into 3rd place on the all-time
list behind Ruth and Gehrig.

Former ML OF Glen Gorbous of Omaha breaks Don Grate's record toss with
a heave of 445 feet 10 inches before a home game. Gorbous has a 6-step
running start and earns $200 for his effort. Sheldon LeJeune of the Reds
reached 426 feet 9 1/2 inches in 1910.

1958
At Wrigley, Robin Roberts wins his 200th game with a flourish, allowing
just 3 hits, as the Phillies win, 3-1. Dale Long's HR is the only score
for Chicago. Roberts wins his 11th this year, one more than he did last year.

At San Francisco, Lew Burdette allows 11 hits, but fans 8 and hits
a bases-loaded single in the Braves' 4-2 win over the Giants. The win
increases the Braves lead to 2 games over SF. Burdette has now won 10 in
a row over the Giants since September of 1954.

1959
P Bob Purkey of the Reds hits a grand slam off Johnny Buzhardt of the Cubs
and wins 12-3. Purkey allows 6 hits. Glen Hobbie takes the loss.

1962
Nothing less than Bill Monbouquette's no-hitter is necessary to defeat
Early Wynn and the White Sox, 1-0. The Red Sox pitcher improves his record
to 9-10. Monbouquette becomes the second Red Sox hurler this season to
no-hit the White Sox. Five weeks earlier, Earl Wilson also threw a no-no
at Chicago's Comiskey Park beating the Pale Hose by the identical 1-0 score.

Drawing a combined 32 bases on balls in a doubleheader, the Tigers (20)
and A's (12) tie an AL record. The Tigers sweep, winning the opener, 6-5,
with 3 runs in the 9th, then taking the nitecap, 9-1 behind Howie Koplitz'
(1-0) complete game effort.

1963
Ellis Burton becomes the 8th player to hit HRs left and righthanded in the
same game, helping the Cubs bury the Braves, 10-2.

1966
Houston's Jim Wynn suffers a fractured left wrist, hand, and elbow slamming
into the CF fence at Philadelphia. Done for the season, the Toy Cannon will
still lead the Astros with 18 HRs. Houston also loses, 6-5.

1968
Against the Red Sox, Stan Bahnsen strikes out 12 batters, the most ever by
a Yankee rookie, in posting his first ML shutout, 1-0. His mark will last
30 years until "El Duque" Hernandez K's 13 batters. A safe bunt by Tresh,
a steal, and a single by Robinson accounts for the only run off Morehead.

1969
Dick Williams pulls Carl Yastrzemski from the Boston lineup after one at-bat
and fines him $500 for "dogging it." Jim Lonborg allows just 3 hits over
8 innings, but the A's rally in the 9th for 3 runs and beat the Sox, 4-3.

1970
At Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, Pittsburgh's Willie Stargell accumulates
14 total bases with 3 doubles and 2 homers, which ties the ML mark for
extra-base hits in a game, and scores 5 runs while driving in 6. Teammate
Bob Robertson also collects 5 hits as the Pirates outslug the Braves,
20-10. In the 7th, Robertson and Stargell combine with Jose Pagan for three
consecutive homers. Atlanta answers with a pair to tie the record for most
homers by 2 teams in one inning.

Rusty Staub has 4 homers - 2 in each game - to pace the Expos to a
doubleheader sweep over the Dodgers, 11-6 and 6-5. Ron Fairly also homers
in game 2.

The Orioles beat the Royals, 9-1, for a ML record 22nd straight win over
one team. The victory goes to Jim Palmer, wearing #22. The 22 consecutive
wins tops the record of the 1883-84 Boston team over the Phils. Kansas City
won the first game in 1969, then dropped 11 in a row that year. They lost
the first 11 this year.

The Cardinals beat the Houston Astros, 14-7, with the help of 9 unearned
runs. Richie Allen has a grand slam for the Birds.

After trailing 4-2, the Reds score 4 in the 8th to defeat the Cubs,
6-4. Johnny Bench and Ty Cline each drive in 2 runs in the 8th.

1971
After homering yesterday off Dave Giusti, rookie Dave Kingman, in his
2nd ML game, clouts 2 homers for the Giants to help sweep a pair from the
first-place Pirates, 11-7 and 8-3. McCovey adds a 3-run homer and Mays a
bases-loaded double. Stargell has a pair of homers for the Pirates to go
over the 100-RBI mark.

With 2 runners on base after scoring 3 times in the 12th, the Cards file
a protest against the Phillies for failing to get the field in playing
condition after 2 rain delays, one 31 minutes and the other 49 minutes. The
Phils say their Zamboni broke down and the score reverts a 3-3 11-inning
tie. The Cards protest will be upheld and the game replayed on September 7.

Hitless in his first 6 at-bats, Jim Northrup homers in the 16th to give
the Tigers a 4-3 win over the Angels. Joe Niekro is the winner in relief.

1972
Nate Colbert becomes the second player to hit five homeruns in a twin bill,
a feat he witnessed on May 2, 1954 as an eight-year-old Cardinal fan at
Sportsman's Park when Stan Musial first accomplished it in 1954. The Padres
slugger also breaks "Stan the Man's" NL mark for RBIs in a twin bill when
he drives in 13 runs and his 22 total bases sets a major league record. The
Padres win two from the Braves, 9-0 and 11-7.

In the nightcap, the Phillies salvage a split of the twin bill when Steve
Carlton, who sees his 30 consecutive scoreless innings streak snapped in the
fourth, beats the Mets at Shea Stadium, 4-1. In the opener, New York outlasted
Philadelphia scoring a run in the bottom of the 18th inning for 3-2 victory.

Trailing by several runs in a game threatened by rain, Billy Martin has his
Detroit Tigers employ stalling tactics while the opposing Milwaukee Brewers
try to speed the game up. The game lasts 6 innings, with Del Crandall's
Brewers winning 9-0 on Skip Lockwood's one-hitter. Umpire Frank Umont
recommends a fine of $1,000 for both managers.

1973
Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk brawl at Fenway. With the score 2-2 in
the top of the 9th, Munson, attempting to score from 3rd on a missed bunt
by Gene Michael, crashes into Fisk and they both come up swinging. Boston
wins, 3-2, in the bottom of the inning to push New York into 2nd place,
.004 behind the Orioles.

In the hot NL East Division race, the first place Cardinals (58-48) take a
pair from Montreal, winning 9-3 behind Rick Wise in the opener. Wise hits a
3-run homer. Reggie Cleveland wins the nitecap, 2-0. The second-place NL-East
Cubs lose, 2-0, to Wayne Twitchell and the Phillies. The Mets (46-57)
remain in last place in the NL-East despite a pair of wins over third
place Pittsburgh. Tom Seaver strikes out 11 and the Mets win the opener,
3-0. George Stone goes 8 2/3 innings to win the nitecap, 5-2. John Milner
chips in with a pair of homers.

The Chicago White Sox fall 4-2 to Kansas City as Royals righthander Steve
Busby picks off Pat Kelly in the 8th. Kelly is on 1B when Busby fakes a
pickoff on the runner on 3B and whirls and fires to 1B to catch Kelly. Busby
has done this move several times this season including once on national
television.

1974
Detroit's Woodie Fryman stops Milwaukee, 2-0, giving up just one hit,
a 7th-inning single to Bobby Mitchell.
