the score 8-1. Mathewson picks up the victory for New York over Jock Menefee.

Behind the pitching of Addie Joss, the Cleveland Americans win over the

cleared, and by the time that occurs it is too dark to continue play.

Reulbach going the distance for Chicago.

1905

2-1 Colts marathon win over the Phils, exactly 2 months after Big Ed topped
the Cards by the same score in 18 innings. Frank Chance's single drives in
Jack McCarthy with the winning run. The game ties the existing ML mark for
the most innings played in a game. A high point in the game, as recounted
in Johnny Evers Touching Second, is when OF Jimmy Slagle, in the 18th,
shoves his hand in his back pocket to get a plug of chewing tobacco just
as the batter cracks a long line drive. Slagle starts after the ball and
discovers that he can't get his hand out of his pocket. He makes a leaping
one-handed catch with his gloved hand, then stops, pulls the tobacco out,
bites off a piece and bows to the crowd.

Tribune, "Bet on the Sox to win the world's championship against the
Spuds." (as noted by Irv Stein).

1907
Mathewson pitches for the 3rd day in a row, beating the Pirates, 7-4. Matty
allows just one hit over the last 6 innings.

1908
The Giants gain the NL lead by winning two at Pittsburgh, after first refusing
to play a doubleheader. McGraw protests that only one game was scheduled and
he was not given 24 hours notice about the 2nd match. But after polling the
players, he relents. Hooks Wiltse then tops Willis, 4-1 and Mathewson beats
Lefty Leifield, 5-1. Willis tires in the 8th, giving up a 2-run triple to
Roger Bresnahan, followed by a Mike Donlin homer. In the nitecap, Donlin and
Larry Doyle each drive home a pair. The doubleheader is watched in New York
on electric diamonds known as "Compton's Baseball Bulletin" at Madison Square
Garden and the Gotham Theatre. Bulletins will display all remaining games.

Smokey Joe Wood, purchased from KC (AA), debuts for Boston. But the White
Sox are the winners, 6-4.

the runaway to teach him a lesson.

At Detroit, A's catcher Paddy Livingston throws out Ty Cobb trying to steal

3B Frank Baker on his bare hand during the play, prompting howls of protest
from the Athletics. The Tigers win, 7-6, and A's manager Connie Mack will
complain to Ban Johnson about Cobb's dirty play. Cobb gets a warning from
the AL president.

1910
Atop the Washington Monument, White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh throws 23 balls
before C Billy Sullivan snares one, then catches 2 more, 555 feet below. It
duplicates Gabby Street's catch of August 21, 1908. The estimated speed of
the ball is 161 feet per second. On the field Walsh will be 18-20 despite
a league-leading 1.27 ERA, the only time a pitcher with a losing record
loses 20 and leads either league in ERA.

1911
The Cubs lose to Brooklyn, 6-5, in 10 innings to lose sole possession of
first place. Doc Scanlan bests Mordecai Brown.

and take the opener as well, 3-1.

At Chicago, the Cubs trounce the Braves, 9-5, putting Boston back in 2nd
place. For Dick Rudolph, it is his first loss after 11 consecutive wins.

1915

gives up one run and earns the win, a 10-7 victory over the A's Rube Bressler.

1916
Babe Ruth fires his 7th shutout of the year, stopping Detroit on 3 hits as
Boston wins, 3-0.

go to war charities.

Lefty Leifield holds Boston to just 4 hits, including 2 scratch singles, but
the Browns manage just 5 hits off Red Sox P Babe Ruth and lose, 3-1. The Sox
score all their runs in the 2nd, including one on a swipe of home by Ruth
on the front end of another double steal, his 2nd steal in two days. It is
Ruth's first steal of home and his only swipe of home as a pitcher. Like
his future steals of home, it comes on a double steal.

The White Sox split with the A's, taking the opener, 9-4, behind Jack
Quinn. A's starter Mule Watson leaves after 6 innings and takes the loss. The
A's take the nitecap, 2-1, behind Scott Perry when Cy Perkins triple scores
the game-winner.

Dodgers. Burleigh Grimes is roughed up for 15 hits in the opener and takes
his first loss in 10 games, and Bill Killefer outguesses former teammate
Larry Cheney in the nitecap for a 3-1 win. With the score tied and a man
on 3B, Cheney attempts to walk Killefer, but the Cub catcher throws his
bat at the ball and connects for a single.

In Baltimore, Babe Ruth's father suffers a fatal concussion in a fight with
his brother-in-law outside his saloon. The funeral will be on the 28th and
Babe will miss two Sox games.

1919
At Cleveland's League Park, P Slim Caldwell is flattened by a bolt of
lightning in his debut with the Indians. It comes with 2 outs in the 9th
and the batter is Jumping Joe Dugan. The free-wheeling spitballer refuses
to leave the game reportedly saying "Give me that danged ball and turn
me toward the plate," and recovers to get the final out of the game, and
defeats Philadelphia, 2-1. Caldwell surmises that the lightning hit the metal
button on his cap, coursed through his body, and exited via his metal spikes,
leaving him with a slight burn on his chest. Caldwell has every reason to be
glad that Speaker inserted a clause in his recent contract stating that the
"pitcher must get drunk the night after he pitches." After the lightning hit,
Caldwell reportedly will drink nothing stronger than tea.

a nifty 1.93.

1924
The Cards nip the Robins, 7-6, in the first of two at Sportsman's Park. Rogers
Hornsby's leadoff HR in the 9th provides the edge. In the 4th inning of the
opener, Cards P Leo Dickerman breaks his left arm when he is hit by a pitch

out of first place since the start of the season, but will give up the top
spot tomorrow when the Cubs beat them. Before the game umpire Dolly Stark
is honored and given a new automobile by Ford Frick as a present from fans
and players. Stark, the varsity basketball coach at Dartmouth, was voted
the most popular umpire in the NL last year.

A 2-out 2-run homer in the 15th by Earl Averill gives Cleveland a 2-0 win
over the A's and ends the greatest pitching duel of the year. Starters Willis
Hudlin for the Tribe and the A's George Turbeville both go the route. Making
his 2nd ML start, Turbeville walks 13 and fires 3 wild pitches, but the
A's turn 6 DPs behind him. If he had retired Averill, the game would have
been called.

1937

back of the Dodgers. In game 2, with darkness setting in pitcher Whit Wyatt
drives home the winner with one out in the 9th off young Howie Pollet. The
games are enlivened by the music of a pickup band, that generates a good
response from the crowd in the band's debut. The musicians will come to be
call the Dodger Sym-phony (dubbed so by announcer Red Barber). This band,
in which none of the 'musicians' could read music, perform their zany antics
at all evening and weekend games.

Harry Craft hits two homers and a double to lead the Reds to a 13-9 win

the Yanks on August 6th, allows 8 hits in winning the nitecap.

1945
Cleveland ace Bob Feller returns from the Navy and attracts a home crowd of
46,477 who watch him strike out 12 and yield only 4 hits in a 4-2 win over
Detroit's Hal Newhouser. He will get 9 starts during the remainder of the
year, and his 5 wins will include a one-hitter and two 4-hitters. With the
war now over, fans are clamoring for entertainment and it is clear Feller
is still baseball's number one ticket seller.

1947
The Giants break the NL record for homers in a season, held by the Cubs,
with their 172nd in a 4-0 shutout by Larry Jansen. Chicago's Hank Borowy
takes the loss. The Cubs take the nitecap, 8-3, led by Eddie Waitkus'
inside-the-park grand slam. This is the 3rd IPH slam this season and that
won't be matched till 1990.

In the 1st game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia, the Reds score 9 runs

After being demoted to the minor leagues six weeks ago, Mickey Mantle
returns to the Yankee lineup, going 1 for 4 with a first-inning single
off Early Wynn, in the team's 2-0 victory in Cleveland. The game will mark
the first time the future Hall of Fame outfielder will wear the iconic #7
on the back of his uniform jersey, his original #6 was given away during
his absence to infielder Bobby Brown, who had worn the numeral in previous
seasons. Gene Woodling cracks his 3rd homer this year off Wynn, the Tribe
ace. Woodling went deep on Wynn on June 24th, July 24th and today.

In another of Bill Veeck's legendary PR stunts, "Fans Managers' Night,"
the Browns defeat the Athletics, 5-3. The Browns' coaches hold up placards
for 1115 fans, who vote "yes" or "no" on the options given them. Manager
Zack Taylor sits in a box behind the dugout with 2 fans who monitor the
voting. Adding to the festivities is Max Patkin, the clown prince of baseball,
who coaches at 1B for several innings. Sherm Lollar voted in behind the
plate instead of Matt Batts, has three hits including a homer, and Hank
Arft, also voted in, knocks home two. Gus Zernial's 28th HR, off Garver,
accounts for all the A's runs. Ned Garver picks up the win. When the stunt
was announced on August 15th, A's GM Art Ehlers bitterly denounced it as
"farcical."

Preacher Roe and the Dodgers stop the Cards' 8-game win streak, 10-4. Roe
registers his 10th straight win over the 2nd-place Birds going back to May 7,
1950. Joe Presko is the loser, exiting in the 2nd inning.

The 2nd place Indians drop 2 games behind the Yankees, winners over Detroit,
when the lose, 9-8, in 16 innings to the Senators. As noted by historian

6-0, in the 2nd game. The 6'7" righthander strikes out 10 Mets to improve his
record to 8-10. Craig Swan takes the loss. The controversy arises when Rusty
Staub hits a ball off Halecki's leg, which caroms to the 2B Derrel Thomas,
who picks it up then drops it. Official scorer Joe Sargis rules it an E-4. NY
columnist Dick Young, watching the game on TV, writes that it should be a
hit and accuses Sargis of subscribing to the theory that the first hit of a
starter should be a 'good one.' The no-hitter stands but UPI's Sargis loses
his job as a sometime scorer. Halicki will never have a winning season in
San Francisco and will post a 55-66 record during his seven year career.

Lou Brock steals the 800th base of his career as the Cardinals beat the
visiting Braves, 6-2. Carl Morton is on the mound and Biff Pocaroba behind
the plate when Lou swipes 2B.

After stealing 2B in the 7th to add to his ML-record of 38 consecutive
steals, Davey Lopes is nabbed in the 12th by Montreal C Gary Carter. The
Expos then score 3 in the 14th off Mike Marshall to beat the Dodgers, 5-2.

1977
Catfish Hunter notches his final win of the year, an 11-1 four-hit victory
over the Twins. New York supports Hunter with homers by Roy White, Mickey
Rivers, Chambliss and Dent.

1980
Twins manager Gene Mauch resigns following a 3-2 loss to the Tigers. He
will be replaced by John Goryl.

Nolan Ryan holds the Cubs to 2 hits in 9 innings to give the Astros their 10th
straight victory, 2-1, winning over Bill Caudill. Jose Cruz homers. During
the streak, the Houston bullpen has thrown 37 2/3 shutout innings.

1981
In his first ML game, Kent Hrbek homers in the 12th inning to give the
Twins a 3-2 win over the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The 21-year-old 1B
grew up in Bloomington, MN, less than a mile from Metropolitan Stadium,
and jumped directly to his hometown club from Class-A Visalia (California
League), where he was hitting .380 with 27 HRs and 112 RBI.

The Reds top the visiting Mets, 2-0, behind Bruce Berenyi's 2-hitter.

1982
Kansas City's John Wathan steals his 31st base of the season in a 5-3 win
over the Rangers, breaking the single-season record for catchers set by
Ray Schalk in 1916. Wathan will finish the season with a career-high 36 SBs.

1983
1B Pete Rose does not play in the Phillies' 5-3 loss to the Giants ending
his consecutive games played streak at 745. Manager Paul Owens had planned
to use Rose as a pinch hitter in the 10th inning, but Joel Youngblood ends
the game with a 2-run homerun off Steve Carlton in the bottom of the 9th.

Cubs Chuck Rainey is one out away from a no-hitter when the Reds' Eddie Milner
singles to center on the first pitch. Rainey settles for a 3-0 one-hitter,
his first complete game of the season. For Milner, this is the 3rd of 5
instances that he will collect his team's only hit in a game, a ML mark
he'll share with Cesar Tovar. The other solos are Dickie Noles and Jerry
Reuss (1982), Len Barker/Donnie Moore (1984) and Alejandro Pena (1986).

Making his only career appearance behind the plate, Oriole infielder
Lenn Sakata catches the 10th inning against the Blue Jays and then hits a
3-run homer as the O's win, 7-4. Toronto goes ahead 4-3 in the top of the
10th after Cliff Johnson homers and Barry Bonnell singles. Tippy Martinez
relieves Tim Stoddard and picks off Bonnell, walks Dave Collins and picks
him off. Tippy then allows a Willie Upshaw single, and picks him off. Helped
by the runners' eagerness to test Sakata, Tippy sets a never-to-be-topped
ML record with the three pickoffs in one inning.

1984
Despite allowing just one hit - a RBI single to Dave Parker in the 7th
inning - Pittsburgh's Jose DeLeon loses to the Reds, 2-0. DeLeon walks 3 and
strikes out 8 but is beaten by Jeff Russell, who tosses a 3-hitter of his own.

The Giants sweep a pair from the Mets with reliever Frank Williams winning
both games. He totals 3 innings of work.

1985
Yankee Don Baylor ties a major league record when he is hit by a pitch for
the 189th time in his career.

Three outs away from a no-hitter against the White Sox, Toronto's Dave
Stieb surrenders consecutive homeruns to Rudy Law and Bryan Little and is
driven from the game. His replacement, Gary Lavelle, gives up a 3rd-straight
homerun, to Harold Baines, before Tom Henke comes in to save the 6-3 win.

1989
After weeks of legal wrangling, Commissioner Bart Giamatti permanently bans
Pete Rose from baseball for his alleged gambling on ML games. Although the
5-page document signed by both parties includes no formal findings, Giamatti
says that he considers Rose's acceptance of the ban to be a no-contest plea
to the charges. Coach Tommy Helms is named Rose's interim replacement as
Cincinnati manager. In his 2004 book, Rose accuses Giamatti of betraying
him and reneging on the agreement.

1991
Mariners hurler Rob Murphy sets what is believed to be a major league
record by appearing in his 121st straight game without a win, a 7-2 loss
to Detroit. Tom Henke had pitched in 120 consecutive winless games from
1986 to 1988.

1993
The Padres score 13 runs in the first inning against the Cardinals, 8 off
starter Allen Watson (6-1), who will finish the year at 6-7. They win,
17-4, as they outhomer the Cards, 5-2.

In the battle of the division tail enders, Milwaukee OF Kevin Reimer is 6
for 6 and scores 4 runs in the Brewers' 7-6 12 inning win over Oakland in the
nitecap of 2. The Brew Crew collects 21 hits. They have 13 hits in the opener,
a 9-2 win in which Reimer is 1 for 2. Milwaukee trails, 2-1, until the 7th.

The Phils' Danny Jackson beats the Rockies, 4-2, for his 10th win of the
year. The Phils have five starters in double-figure wins for the first time
since 1932.

1996
Atlanta defeats Chicago, 6-5, led by 1B Fred McGriff, who strokes 5 hits,
including a double and 2 homers, and drives in 4 runs.

Cubs minor leaguer Kerry Wood of Daytona combines on his 2nd no-hitter,
a 3-0 win over Vero Beach. Wood goes 8 innings. And he pitched 7 innings
of no-hit ball on July 28 against Tampa.

1999
Mariner Ken Griffey Jr joins Babe Ruth, Ralph Kiner, Duke Snider, Ernie
Banks, Harmon Killebrew and Mark McGwire as the only players to hit 40
homers in four consecutive seasons.

The Phillies wallop the Padres, 18-2, as CF Rob Ducey gets 5 of Philadelphia's
22 hits. Bobby Abreu has 2 homers and 6 RBIs, and Sanders scores both runs
for the Padres, one on a HR.

The Cards lose to the Expos, 8-4, despite Mark McGwire's 508th career
homer and his 51st of the year. He has hit 493 of these while playing 1B,
equaling Lou Gehrig's mark for the position.

The Braves score 4 runs in the 6th inning to rally for a 6-4 win over the
Reds. John Smoltz is the victor, running his string of consecutive wins
over Cincinnati to 11.

The Red Sox acquire P Kent Mercker from the Cardinals in exchange for C
David Benham and P Mike Matthews.

2000
In his fifth rehabilitation start in the minors, Devil Rays 26-year-old
pitcher Tony Saunders' left arm breaks again throwing a wild pitch. The
Devil Ray southpaw first broke his left humerus on May 26, 1999 throwing
a 3-2 pitch in a game against the Rangers at Tropicana Field.

2002
The Angels defeat the Red Sox, 2-0. Manny Ramirez' streak of reaching base
in 14 straight plate appearances is stopped 2 short of the ML mark.

The Orioles drop a pair to the Blue Jays, losing 4-1 and 8-3. This is the
start of a miserable 4-31 year-end slide. In game 1, a makeup of a July 23
rainout, Vernon Wells has 4 hits, including a homer, and scores 3 runs. Pete
Walker pitches 7 innings for the win. The bright spot for Baltimore is
Mike Bordick, who fields 4 chances flawlessly to set a ML record with 428
straight chances without an error. It breaks the mark that Cal Ripken set
in 1990. Wells and Chris Woodward hit homers in game 2.

2003
The A's ride grand slams by Ramon Hernandez and Miguel Tejada to a 17-2
triumph over the Blue Jays. It is the 1st time in the franchise's 103-year
history that two players connects for slams in the same game. Prior to today,
Oakland had not hit one this season. Mike Neu earns the first save of his
career when he pitches the final three innings.

Professional golfer Phil Mickelson tries his hand at baseball in a
tryout with the Toledo Mud Hens, the Triple-A affiliate of the Detroit
Tigers. Mickelson, who golfs left but throws right, offers a bounty of $300
to any player who can hit a homerun off him. Unfortunately for the golfer,
his pitching prowess did not impress Mud Hens or Tigers management. Most
of the 10 batters he faces are pitchers, and former major-leaguer Gene
Kingsale is his only strikeout victim. But, he gives up no homers.

2004
Bud Selig, citing how disruptive a delay in the major league schedule would
be on pennant races, says it is unlikely major league players will ever be
able to take part in the Olympics. The baseball commissioner hopes a World
Cup, which begins in 2006, will serve as a substitute for the Summer Games.

2005
At Tiger Stadium, Bill Freehan hits his 200th and final homerun in a 12-7
loss to the White Sox. The Detroit catcher will finish his career with 100
homers hit at home with the other 100 dingers hit on the road.

The Mets crush the Diamondbacks, 18-4, behind a 20-hit barrage. Rookie
Mike Jacobs gets 4 hits, including a 2B and a pair of HRs, and scores 5
runs in his 4th ML game. With the homers, Jacobs becomes the 1st player
in ML history to hit 4 HRs in his 1st 4 days since his ML debut (13 plate
appearances). David Wright also gets 4 hits, including a 2B and a pair of
HRs. David Wright ties a NL record by scoring 8 runs in two consecutive games.

The Padres down the Astros, 7-4, as Trevor Hoffman gets his 425th save to move
past John Franco into 2nd place behind Lee Smith on the all-time saves list.

2006
Sean Casey probably becomes the first player in baseball history to ground
out to left field. The unique 5-7-3 play is the result of the Tigers'
first baseman heading back to the dugout thinking he was robbed of a hit
when the ball actually glanced off Joe Crede's glove and then is thrown
to first by left fielder Pablo Ozuna just beating the runner to the bag.
Jon Garland (15-4) stops the Tigers as the White Sox win, 10-0. Jermaine
Dye hits 2 homers and a double and LF Pablo Ozuna has 3 hits.

The Red Sox edge the Angels, 2-1. Jered Weaver gets the 1st loss of his
career for the Angels. He had won his first 9 decisions, tying Whitey Ford
for the AL record by beginning his career with 9 straight wins as a starter.

2007
After waiting four hours and one minute to start the contest because of rain,
the Yankees and Tigers begin an 11-inning marathon which takes four hours 24
minutes to complete. The last pitch, which results in a three-run walk-off
round-tripper hit by Tiger shortstop Carlos Guillen, is thrown at 3:30 am
and sends the several thousand fans remaining at CoAmerica home listening
to Lionel Richie's 'All Night Long' as they exit the bllpark.

A day after protests concerning the sale of the gang-related items in East
Harlem, New Era announces it will remove the offending headwear which bears
the colors and symbols of the Bloods, the Crips and the Latin Kings. Unknown
to the Yankees, two white team caps had been wrapped with red and blue
bandannas made by the MLB's official cap manufacturer and had appeared to
represent the Bloods and Crips, and also a black cap with the familiar
interlocking NY had been available embroidered with a crown symbolic of
the Latin Kings.

2008
Scoring at least one run in every inning, Hawaii wins the Little League
World Series beating Mexico, 12-3. To advance to the championship game,
Waipahu scored six runs in the last inning (sixth), overcoming a four-run
deficit, to beat Lake Charles, Louisiana in the semi-finals, 7-5.

After striking out, Denard Span is tossed from the game by plate umpire
Brian Gorman for throwing his bat and helmet. The ejection comes after the
game has ended as the rookie's called third strike is the final pitch of
the Twins' 5-3 loss to the Angels.

2010
Bud Selig, former Brewers owner and baseball's current commissioner,
is honored with the unveiling of a bronze, seven-foot statue at Miller
Park. Brian Maughan's piece of art, which portrays Selig with his right
arm extended and his hand holding a baseball, joins the sculptures of Robin
Yount and Hank Aaron in front of the Milwaukee ball park.

2013
For the first time in history, the All-Star Game starters face each other
in the same regular season when Mets right-hander Matt Harvey and the
Tigers' Max Scherzer are opposing pitchers in Detroit's 3-0 victory over
the Amazins' at Citi Field, the site of this year's Mid-Summer Classic. The
historic match-up ends with the New York starter, who gives up 13 hits in
6 2/3 innings, going on the DL for season-ending surgery, and his opponent
becoming just the third pitcher to start a season with a 19-1 record,
joining Rube Marquard (1912 Giants) and Roger Clemens (2001 Yankees).

After the teams combine for 137 at-bats, 35 hits, 32 strikeouts and 28
walks, the Diamondbacks beat the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, 12-7. The
18-inning contest takes seven-hours six-minutes to complete, making it the
longest game in history, in terms of time, for both franchises.

2014
Joc Pederson becomes the fourth player in the history of the Pacific Coast
League to have a 30-30 season, and the first to accomplish the feat in
80 years, when he steals his 30th base for the Isotopes. The 22-year-old
Albuquerque slugger, who has 32 homeruns and a .432 slugging percentage in
116 games this season, will join the Dodgers when rosters expand next week.

2022
George Kirby of Seattle started the game against the Washington Nationals
with 24 straight strikes, setting a Major League record for most consecutive
strikes to start a game since 1988, when pitch-tracking began. He broke
the record that was set by Joe Musgrove in 2018 with 21 straight strikes.
