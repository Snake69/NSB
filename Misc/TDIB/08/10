1901
At Cleveland's League Park, the Blues (Indians) beat Chicago, 11-7. White
Sox right-hander Frank Isbell strands eleven runners on the base paths to
set an American League record.

In the 2nd game of a DH, Washington Senators P Dale Gear gives up an AL record
41 total bases in losing, 13-0, to the Athletics. The 23 hits includes 4
doubles, 4 triples and 2 HRs. Gear also establishes an AL mark by allowing
10 extra base hits ... Luis Tiant will tie the record in 1969. Philadelphia
A's pitcher Snake Wiltse, brother of Hooks, has 2 doubles and 2 triples, an
AL record, and "could've had another base if he had run hard." (Washington
Post) He is just one of 3 hurlers in history to collect 4 extra-base hits
in a game, and his 10 total bases is a ML record for a pitcher. For Snake,
acquired last month from the Pirates, it is the 2nd shutout over Washington
in a week. Snake's batterymate, Doc Powers, also has 4 hits including a
triple and a homer. In the opener, a 9-4 Washington win, Senators pitcher
Win Mercer becomes the first AL hurler to steal home. Hall of Fame second
baseman Napoleon Lajoie has a pair of homers for the A's in game 1, his second
game in a row with 2 homers, but then gets tossed in the 7th for arguing a
call. He hit 2 homers in yesterday's game-2 victory. Lajoie will lead the
AL in homers with 14, drive in 125 runs, and hit .422 to win the Triple Crown.

Before a crowd of 5,000 in Cleveland, the AL-leading White Sox cannot
overcome a 7-0 lead and fall, 11-7. Frank Isbell sets an AL record for LOB
by leaving 11 on base for the Sox.

1902
At Chicago, Boston tops the White Sox, 5-4, in 11 innings as Cy Young
records his 25th win.

1903
Brooklyn's Henry Schmidt drops his 2nd game in 3 days to the Giants, this
time losing, 3-1, to Christy Mathewson. Matty wins his 20th and loses his
shutout in the 9th on a passed ball by Jack Warner. Schmidt, 29, will win
21 games in this, his only season in the Majors. A westerner, he will return
his 1904 contract unsigned with the note, "I do not like living in the East
and will not report."

At Boston's Huntington Grounds, Cy Young tosses no-hit ball for 7 innings,
and beats the A's, 7-2.

1904
Jack Chesbro is knocked out by the White Sox after pitching 30 complete
games in a row. For the year he will win 41 games, pitching 48 complete
games out of 51 starts for the Highlanders. All are post-1900 records. His
455 innings pitched will be topped only by Ed Walsh's 464 in 1908.

1905
Catchers are not expected to hit triples, but Boston Beaneater backstop Pat
Moran legs out a trio of 3-base hits against the Pirates in Boston's 7-4 win.

In a great pitching duel, New York ace Christy Mathewson allows 3 Chicago
hits, while the Giants manage just 4 off Ed Reulbach. New York tallies an
unearned run in the 6th for the game's only score.

1906
In Chicago, the Sox edge the Highlanders, 2-1, managing just 4 hits off
Jack Chesbro. Ed Walsh is the winner.

1908
Twenty thousand fans, the largest ever to watch a Monday game, crowd the
Polo Grounds to see the matchup of Christy Mathewson and the Cubs' Orval
Overall. Matty doesn't disappoint, winning 3-2, but Overall allows just one
hit in the loss. Roger Bresnahan's double in the 3-run 1st is the lone safety.

1909
At the West Side Grounds, Cubs ace Ed Reulbach wins his 16th straight
against Brooklyn, 8-1. Reulbach allows just 6 hits in tying a since-topped
20th century NL record for consecutive wins against one team. The string
started on July 30, 1907. Reulbach also beat the Reds 16 straight times.

1911
The Detroit club announces that a new grandstand, costing $300,000, will
be built for the 1912 season.

1912
Led by Grover Cleveland Alexander, the Phils whip the Reds, 10-2. Pete wins
the game on the mound and also adds a homerun.

In a game at Boston, Chicago star Johnny Evers pushes umpire Finneran after
the latter challenges Evers, Zimmerman and Chance to fight him under the
stands after the game. Evers will be suspended for five days, and though the
Cubs win three games, there will be a howl that president Lynch is favoring
the Giants. Downs will fill in at 2B for Chicago. Chicago scores 3 in the
8th to win, 11-10.

1913
In Cincinnati, the Giants edge the Reds, 5-4. Fred Merkle lines a drive to
LF that hits the wall on the fly, but he is cut down at the plate on his
attempt at an inside-the-park homer. He is the first hitter to reach the
wall on a fly.

1914
Bill James tops the Reds, 3-1, to push the Braves past the Cubs (53-48)
and the Cardinals (54-49).

1915
In Washington, Detroit 3B Ossie Vitt is hit by a Walter Johnson fastball and,
after being knocked out for 5 minutes, leaves the game with a concussion. A
rattled Johnson then allows 4 runs in the first inning, two runs on a
2-run homer by George Burns, and another 4 through the 6th inning to lose
(he will be 17-2 at home this year). Ty Cobb, observing Johnson's fear of
hitting a batter, will begin crowding the plate on the Washington ace from
here on. Cobb will average .435 for the rest of his career against Walter,
after topping .222 only once in the previous 8 years.

Babe Ruth is 2 for 4 while pitching the Red Sox to a 10-3 win over the
Browns in the 2nd of two. Ruth strikes out 7 in winning his 10th.

1917
Babe Ruth beats the Tigers, 5-4, giving up just 4 hits. The Babe's drive into
the CF bleachers, said to be the longest hit at Fenway, is the difference. The
homer is Babe's first of the year.

Four days after shutting out the Browns, Walter Johnson pitches a 1-hitter
against the Chicago White Sox. Tomorrow, three Senators - Jim Shaw (6
2/3 innings), Doc Ayres and George Dumont - will duplicate Big Train's
performance, also against Chicago (as noted by Steve Boren).

1918
The Reds bang out 17 hits to defeat the Cards, 9-8. Edd Roush drives home
the winner in the 9th inning with two out by making his 5th hit of the
day. Heinie Groh, 2nd in the NL to Wheat in hitting at .327 through August
8, is 3 for 3. Wheat will win the title, but Roush (.301 through August 8)
will finish 2nd with a .333 average, .002 behind Zack.

In Brooklyn, the Robins take the opener over the Phils, 4-0, behind Burleigh
Grimes' two-hitter. Zack Wheat has 3 of the Robins' 7 hits off loser
Joe Oeschger. In the nitecap, a fair call in the 4th inning on a drive
by Cy Williams prompts all the Brooklyn players to rush umpire Charley
Moran. Moran's call, a double, is just one of 4 hits that veteran Jack
Coombs allows. The Phils win, 3-2, however, and it takes a dozen policemen
to protect Moran after the game.

1919
More than 28,000 crowd Wrigley Field to watch Grover Cleveland Alexander
shut out the Giants, 2-0.

1920
Failure to cover 1B in the 7th costs Bill Doak a no-hitter in the Cards'
5-1 win over the Phils. Doak, a decent-fielding pitcher, is the inventor of
a revolutionary glove with multi-thong web laced into the first finger and
thumb. The Rawlings Sporting Goods company began producing a Bill Doak glove
in the spring of this year, after field testing it in 1919. They will make
a three-finger model in 1925 and the Bill Doak glove will stay in Rawlings'
line until 1953.

Babe Ruth stretches a 1st-inning single into a double, but wrenches his right
knee sliding into 2B. Cleveland's Elmer Smith smashes a 3rd-inning grand
slam, his 2nd in 11 days, off Carl Mays, but the Yanks tie in regulation and
win it, 7-4, in the 10th. The Yanks' win cuts the Indians lead to 2 1/2 games.

1922
The Pirates continue their hot hitting, crushing the Phils 14-4 on 16
hits. Today's hitting stars are LF Carson Bigbee with 5 hits, and starter Hal
Carlson, who lofts his first ML homer. The remarkable team effort results
in the 5th game in a row in which every Pirate in the lineup collects a
hit. The Bucs have now won 11 straight and their team average is .309. The
Bucs will win 2 more to run their streaks to 13 games - good enough for 3rd
place behind the Giants. In tomorrow's game, only SS Jim Tierney will fail
to collect a hit.

1924
Ty Cobb steals 2B once, 3B twice and home once (in the 7th) in the Tigers'
13-7 win over Boston. The Tiger manager also scores 4 times. The win puts
them on top in the AL as the Indians beat the Yankees, 7-1.

The Cubs edge last-place Boston, 3-2, behind the pitching of Tony
Kaufmann. For Kaufmann, it is his 11th straight win over the Braves going
back to September 9, 1921.

1926
In relief of Lefty Grove, Joe Pate picks up the win for the A's in a 4-3
decision over the White Sox. It is Pate's 9th straight win as he finishes
with a ML record 9-0 in 1926. Tom Zachary (12-0 in 1929), Howie Krist (10-0
in 1941), and Ken Holtzman (9-0 in 1968) will peer Pate's perfect percentage.

1927
The Red Sox, winners of 11 out of 14, drop a 12-2 laugher to the A's. Cobb
has another 3-hit day as the A's collect 13 hits to make it easy for Lefty
Grove. Sox pitcher Ted Wingfield gets no decision but is pounded for 7 runs
in the 7th and 8th innings. He does have a measure of satisfaction, striking
out Chick Galloway with 2 outs in the 6th inning. This is Wingfield's only
strikeout in 74 2/3 innings, a ML record for soft tossing.

At Washington, Babe Ruth drives in 4 runs, 3 on his 36th homer, as the
Yankees prevail, 4-3. Tom Zachary is the loser.

1929
Pitching for the visiting Cards, Grover Alexander beats the Phils, 7-1,
for his 373rd and last NL victory. It is noted at the time that he ties
Mathewson for NL wins. Relieving after 8 innings, he pitches 4 scoreless
relief innings to win, 11-9, in 12 innings of the nitecap. The Phils take
the opener, 7-1. Alexander will be sent back to St. Louis on August 20th
after one too many curfew violations and finish the season at 9-8.

1930
In a Sunday doubleheader in St. Louis, 21,000 fans cheer as the Cards sweep
two from the first place Dodgers. Burleigh Grimes takes the opener, 8-2,
despite Babe Herman starting a triple play for Brooklyn. Bill Hallahan K's 12
to win the nitecap, 4-0. The 4th place Cards are now 9 games behind Brooklyn.

Before 45,000 fans, the Cubs sweep two from the Boston Braves at Wrigley
to move a game in back of Brooklyn. Hack Wilson drives home 7 runs on 3
homers, the last his 39th, to back up Charlie Root's 3-hit shutout in the
opener. The Cubs win, 6-0, beating Bob Smith. Pat Malone completes the
sweep twirling a 5-hitter to beat Bruce Cunningham, 11-1, in the nitecap.

The last place Phillies win 18-0, as Claude "Weeping" Willoughby defeats the
Reds in the first game of a twin bill, then take the 2nd game, 4-3. Chuck
Klein and Lefty O'Doul each total 6 hits in the 2 games. The Phils will
tie the ML mark they set last season by playing just six shutout games,
winning 4 and losing 2. Today's shutout margin ties a team record set in 1910.

At Fenway, Detroit's Earl Whitehill wins his 9th straight, beating the Red
Sox, 4-2. The Sox score their 2 runs in the 9th. Detroit collects 9 hits,
but John Stone goes hitless ending his 27-game hitting streak.

1934
Babe Ruth announces 1934 is definitely his final season as a regular
player. He says he will seek a managerial role and will pinch-hit.

In Detroit, Schoolboy Rowe scatters 13 hits in 11 innings as the Tigers
edge the Indians, 6-5. Rowe drives home the winner with a sac fly in the
11th. It is Rowe 12th win in a row. Rowe will hit .303 for the season,
and win 4 of his own games by driving in the winning run.

1935
New York's George Selkirk drives in 8 runs, one short of Jimmie Foxx'
AL record, with 2 HRs - one a grand slam - and a single as the Yankees
pummel the A's, 18-7. Gehrig has a homer and drives in 5 runs in the game,
then adds 4 more RBIs in the 7-2 nitecap win.

1936
The Cards are back in first place, beating the Cubs in a game interrupted
by a fight between former teammates Dizzy Dean and Tex Carleton. Dean loses
the fight, but wins the game, 7-3, outpointing Lon Warneke, for his 19th win.

It must be the name. Buddy Myer, last year's AL batting champ, is sent home
by Washington to recover from a season-long stomach ailment. Last week,
Billy Myers, Reds SS and captain, was operated on for a "telescoped bowel,"
and is expected to be out for the season.

1937
In a 6-5 loss to the Pirates in Chicago, Cubs 1B Ripper Collins fractures his
right ankle sliding into home plate. Collins, leading the Cubs in homers with
16, receives a "roll and a shove" from Buc catcher Al Todd and is out until
September 17. Cy Blanton is the winning pitcher over Chicago's Clyde Shoun.

Washington rolls to a sweep of the A's, winning 15-7 and 8-6. Washington 3B
Buddy Lewis makes 4 errors in game 1, tying Jimmy Burke's ML record set on
May 27, 1901. (Milwaukee's Burke made all his errors in one inning.) In the
3rd inning of the opener, the Senators score 9 runs on 3 hits, collecting
6 walks and 3 errors from the A's. C Earle Brucker homers in each game for
the Mackmen.

1939
With the Red Sox beating the A's, 7-5, to sweep their series, the Yankees
knuckle under by the same score to Dutch Leonard and the Washington
Senators. Leonard is now 4-0 over New York. The Yankees' lead over the Red
Sox is now 5 1/2 games.

At Rochester, the Red Wings (IL) bombard Jersey City, 26-1. Si Johnson
coasts to his 19th win.

1941
At Wrigley Field, 18,739 fans cheer for "Charlie Root Day." The popular
pitcher, whose retirement was announced, receives a check, a station wagon
paid for by the fans, and a pig for his farm. The Reds are unimpressed and
hand Root and the Cubs a 3-1 defeat. Johnny Vander Meer gets the win.

The Yanks flay the A's twice, 11-2 and 4-1, to increase their margin to 14
games. Knott gives up 17 hits in losing the opener to Mario Russo, while
Bill Dickey's 9th-inning triple with 2 on decides the nitecap. DiMaggio has
a pair of hits in the opener, but goes hitless in the nitecap, the 5th game
in the last 8 that he's been collared.

The Dodgers match the Cards by sweeping a doubleheader, topping the Braves,
14-4 and 4-0. Hamlin wins the opener and Freddy Fitzsimmons (5-0) takes the
nitecap. In the 5th inning of game 1, reliever Dick "Leif" Errickson hits
Medwick on the right elbow and follows by hitting Camilli in the head. When
he plunks Reiser, the fans start tossing cushions. The 3 HBP are one short
of the record.

1942
In a playoff of a 16-inning tie on August 8, the Pirates again hammer Mort
Cooper, and win, 6-4. Cooper won't lose the rest of the year.

1944
At Crosley Field, Red Barrett of the Boston Braves throws only 58 pitches
and shuts out the Cincinnati Reds, 2-0. This is the ML record for fewest
pitches in a 9-inning game. The game takes one hour 15 minutes, the fastest
night game ever. Barrett gives up two singles and is never behind on a
batter. Damon Phillips has 3 hits and the only RBIs in the game.

The Browns win their 10th in a row as RH Denny Galehouse beats the Yankees,
3-0.

1945
Richard Muckerman buys out Don Barnes' interest in the Browns and now
controls 50 percent of the club.

1946
In the top of the first inning, Yankee starter Ernie 'Tiny' Bonham gives
up two hits, but retires the side with only four pitches. After leadoff
hitter Wally Moses singles on the first pitch of the contest he is thrown
out stealing after Tiny's second toss, then Johnny Pesky singles on the
third pitch with Dom DiMaggio grounding into a double play on the next
pitch to finish the fast frame.

1947
With 5 hits Stan Musial finally lifts his average over .300, and the Cardinals
make a run at the Dodgers sweeping the Pirates, 5-0 and 7-5. Murry Dickson
allows 4 hits in the shutout. Musial will finish at .312, and the Cards 5
games back of Brooklyn.

1950
In the 2nd game of a twinbill, Washington pitcher Gene Bearden bats 8th with
batterymate Len Okie in the 9th spot. Bearden picks up a hit but loses the
game, 4-3, to Boston's Walt Masterson. Masterson swipes a base, the first
stolen base by a Red Sox pitcher this year.

1952
Ed Fitzgerald of the Pirates pinch hits twice against the Cubs. His first
time is in the 6th inning when, batting for Howie Pollet, he flies out. In
the 9th inning, Pittsburgh's starting catcher Clyde McCullough is injured and
forced to leave the game. With the permission of Cubs manager Phil Cavarretta,
who shows uncommon courtesy, Fitzgerald pinch hits for McCullough, making him
the only major leaguer ever to hit for two different players in a game. The
Cubs still win, 4-3, after taking the opener, 9-5.

The Red Sox cut the Yankees' lead in the AL to 1 1/2 games with a 3-1
victory at Yankee Stadium. Dick Gernert and Dom Dimaggio hit 10th-inning
homers off reliever Johnny Sain, and 41-year-old Al Benton picks up the win
with 1 2/3 innings of relief. Benton comes in for Mel Parnell with one out
in the 9th and the sacks full and stops the threat. Mantle, leading off the
10th, is retired on a drag bunt attempt by Benton, who is the only hurler
to pitch to both Mantle and Babe Ruth.

1953
On his 29th birthday, Bob Porterfield of the Senators has his 2nd one-hitter
of the season, as he masters the Red Sox, 2-0. Piersall has the only hit
and the only walk for Boston.

1954
Boston's Mel Parnell, who fractured his arm in April, posts his first win
of the year, beating the Senators, 4-0.

Bob Grim becomes the first Yankee rookie to win 15 games since Borowy in
1942, hurling a 5-2 win over the A's. The Bombers pull to 3 games in back
of the Indians.

1955
Stan Musial slugs his 1,000th extra base hit, and his 529th career double,
connecting off Lew Burdette, as the Cards down the host Braves, 7-2.

1956
Cincinnati C Ed Bailey hits a grand slam as the Redlegs win, 8-1, over
Milwaukee to move into 2nd place, a half game behind the Braves and a half
game ahead of the Dodgers.

1957
The Braves roll over the Cards, 9-0, as Hurricane Bob Hazle knocks in 3
runs on 3 hits.

At Baltimore, Mantle hammers his 31st homer and adds 3 singles to lead the
Yanks to a 6-3 win over the O's. Mantle's homer is the first to clear the
CF hedge, some 30 feet beyond the 425-foot sign in center. Mantle is now
hitting .380, and the Yanks are leading Chicago by 5 games.

1958
The Pirates complete a 4-game sweep of the Reds, beating them 3-2 and
4-3. Relievers Gross and Face are the winners. In the nightcap, Pirates CF
Bill Virdon records 2 assists in the 7th, tying a ML mark.

1959
Ken Boyer of the Cardinals begins a 29-game hitting streak, the longest since
Stan Musial's 30-games in 1950. The Giants score 3 in the 9th to win, 3-2.

1960
Ted Williams hits a pair of homers and a double to pace the Red Sox to a 6-1
win over the Indians. Ted has 21 homers for the season. The 1st of the two
today, #512, moves Ted past Mel Ott into 4th place on the all-time list. After
the game, Williams announces that he will retire at the end of the season.

1961
With his 21st pinch hit of the season, Dave Philley breaks an American
League record, set by Ed Coleman of the Browns in 1936. The 41-year-old,
pinch hitting for Dick Williams in the eighth inning, sets the new pinch
hitting mark with a double to right field in the Orioles' 8-0 win over the
A's at Memorial Stadium. Milt Pappas throws the shutout.

1962
In the first of 3 games with the Dodgers at Candlestick, Bill O'Dell coasts
to an 11-2 win over Johnny Podres. The loss cuts the Dodgers' lead to 4 games.

The Phillies lose their 8th in a row, when the Cardinls twice come from
behind to win, 7-4. Bobby Shantz is the winner with 4 shutout innings of
relief. He also singles in a run. Phils 1B Frank Torre is caught stealing
for the 1st time in his career, a NL record of 592 games without being
caught. He has stolen 4 bases since '56.

At Buffalo (IL), Columbus beats Buffalo, 6-5, in 12 innings. Bob Veale of
Columbus strikes out 22 Bison batters in nine innings.

1963
In the A's 6-3 win, A's pinch-hit star George Alusik suffers a broken wrist
when hit by Indian Pedro Ramos.

Benched for poor hitting, Brooks Robinson's streak of 463 straight games
at third is stopped. Brooks pinch hits in the 8th inning, however, as
the Senators edge the Orioles, 6-5. Boog Powell smashes three homers in a
losing cause.

1965
At New York, Jim Kaat benefits from sloppy Yankee fielding and Minnesota
scores 6 unearned runs to beat the Yankees, 7-3.

In the 2nd of two at Fenway, the O's Brooks Robinson hits a ball that
appears to hit the net above the Green Monster, but is ruled in play by Lou
DiMuro. Robinson reaches third with a triple, and then adds a homer in the
7th. Brooks lost another homer last year. The O's win, 12-4, after losing
the opener, 15-5.

1966
Chuck Dressen dies of a heart attack in Detroit, age 67. He had managed
the Tigers earlier in the season.

1968
On Old Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium, the Twins stop the Yankees, 3-2. New
York's only scores are two solo shots by Mickey Mantle off Jim Merritt. It
is the Mick's 46th 2-homer game.

1969
Mike Cuellar's (15-9) string of 35 straight batters retired is ended by
Cesar Tovar, who also spoils Cuellar's no-hit bid with a 9th-inning single
in a 2-0 win against the Twins. Tovar has the only hit in a game for the
3rd time, and the 2nd time this season (both against the Orioles).

Don Sutton breaks his 13-game losing streak to the Cubs with a 4-2 win
at Los Angeles, but needs relief help to do it. Sutton tops Ken Holtzman,
who handed Sutton his last four losses to Chicago. It was one short of the
most consecutive losses by any pitcher to one club in ML history, and is the
NL record for straight losses to a team from the start of a career. Sutton
will close out his career with a record of 18-20 versus the Cubs.

1971
At Metropolitan Stadium in Minneapolis, Harmon Killebrew becomes the tenth
player to join the 500 homerun club as he hits the historic homer in the
first inning off Mike Cuellar. Later in the game the 36-year-old first
baseman connects for #501, but "Killer's" two round-trippers are to no
avail as the Twins lose to the Orioles in 10 innings, 4-3.

At San Francisco's Candlestick Park, Juan Marichal records his 50th
career shutout as the Giants blank the Expos, 1-0. The Dominican hurler's
ninth-inning double helps to build the winninng run. Marichal leads all
active hurlers in shutouts.

Sixteen baseball researchers at Cooperstown form the Society for American
Baseball Research (SABR), with founder Robert Davids as president.

1972
Milwaukee rookie Gary Ryerson beats Jim Palmer and the Orioles, 1-0. Ryerson
allows 10 hits in the shutout. George Scott singles in the lone run.

1974
Jorge Lebron, the youngest professional player ever, makes his debut for
the Phillies farm club Auburn. The fourteen-year-old shortstop plays three
games before returning to Puerto Rico to finish junior high school.

1976
Jim Palmer one-hits the Twins, as the O's win, 2-0. Mike Cubbage's single
in the 2nd is the only hit.

1977
Billy Martin installs Reggie Jackson as the Yankees' regular clean-up
hitter. The Yanks beat the A's, 6-3, as Guidry outpitches Vida Blue. Greg
Nettles belts his 26th homer of the season. New York will win 40 of their
final 53 games, with Jackson contributing 13 HRs and 49 RBIs.

For the 2nd time in two years a doubleheader at the Vet goes past 3 a.m. The
Phils top the Expos in game one, 6-1, in a game that starts an hour late
because of the rain. A 2:27 delay in the 3rd takes its toll on the 46,664
fans in attendance. The 2nd game gets underway at 11:50 p.m. and lasts until
3:23 a.m. with the same results as game one. Lonborg and Christianson are
the winners.

The Red Sox score 3 in the 8th - two on a pinch homer by Bernie Carbo -
in beating the Angels, 11-10 at home. It is Boston's 11th win in a row,
their longest streak since 1950. Jim Willoughby (4-0), recovering from a
broken ankle, is the winner.

The Pirates edge the Cubs, 2-1, in 18 innings as Ed Ott drives in the winning
run with a sac fly. The Cubs' only score is a homer by Jerry Morales in
the 6th as they strand 15. Pirates 2B Phil Garner sets a ML record at 2B
for the longest game with no putouts, but he does make 2 errors.

The Dodgers' Rick Rhoden allows 2 hits - both by Dave Concepcion - in beating
the Reds, 1-0. Fred Norman is the loser, though he gives up no earned runs.

1978
The Angels whip the A's, 16-5, behind Frank Tanana's 7 innings of work. A's
2B Mike Edwards ties the ML record with 2 unassisted DPs. Claude Richey
of Louisville was the first to accomplish it on July 9, 1899. The Angels'
Willie Horton has an eventful 4 innings when he replaces Wallis in LF in
the 5th. The veteran homers in the bottom of the 5th, hits a 2-run double
in the 6th, then makes an error in the 7th and 8th innings. He leaves after
his E in the 8th, his last appearance as an outfielder.

The Yankees' Ron Guidry (16-2) tosses a 3-hitter to beat the Brewers, 9-0.

In just his 2nd start, Dodgers P Bob Welch beats the Giants and Vida Blue,
12-2, to put Los Angeles into a tie for first place.

The Red Sox trip the Indians, 6-5, in 13 innings as Butch Hobson scores the
tying run on a bizarre play. He lofts a pop fly behind second base and races
around to 2B as 2B Duane Kuiper loses the ball in the sun. Kuiper picks up
the ball but bumps into 1B Andre Thornton and the ball rolls towards first
base and C Bo Diaz. With Hobson motoring towards 3B, Diaz overthrows the
base. Hobson, having slid into third, picks himself up and races home. The
throw from the outfield is in time to Diaz, but he can't get the ball out of
his glove and a sliding Hobson is home free. A George Scott double and a Rick
Burleson single then wins the game. Mike Stanley (8-1) picks up the victory.

1979

well when he joins the discussion. With that, the fans bombard the field

The Dodgers beat the host Reds, 5-2, in spite of a mammoth HR by Adam Dunn
off Jose Lima. Believed to be one of the longest homers in ML history,
it is measured at 535 feet. The ball carries over the batter's eye beyond
the centerfield fence, bounces on Mehring Way 20 feet beyond the stadium,
and lands on a piece of driftwood in the Ohio River. Since the river is
actually claimed by Kentucky, the homer is probably the first in ML history
to carry into another state.

2005
Jackie Robinson's former Negro League roommate 103-year-old Ted Radcliffe,
probably the oldest professional baseball player, dies after a long battle
with cancer. The 1943 Negro American League Most Valuable player was dubbed

one of his own in the night cap.

today," after his struggling club loses to the first-place White Sox. 2-1.

tells his listeners that manager Felipe Alou's mind "has turned to Cream
of Wheat".

Marlins 3B Mike Lowell pulls to hidden ball trick to nab Luis Terrero at 3B
in the 8th inning and prevent the potential tying run from scoring. Reliever

ruse off for the second time in a year. Florida beats the Diamondbacks, 10-5.

2006
Red Sox P Curt Schilling (14-5) takes a pounding, going 7 1/3 innings and
allowing 11 hits against the Royals. Ten of the hits are for extra bases
(9 doubles and 1 HR) and Schilling ties the AL mark for pitchers with
it. The record is held by by Dale Gear (1901 Senators) and Luis Tiant Jr
(1969 Indians). Emil Brown has a HR and a double off of Schilling and Reggie
Sanders has three doubles. They are all needed as Kansas City scores 3 in
the 8th to win, 5-4.

2008

league history to reach this mark.

player to have done both.

2010
In an ugly first-inning brawl at the Great American Ball Park, Cardinals
backstop Jason LaRue suffers a mild concussion and bruised ribs with his
battery-mate Chris Carpenter also receiving bruises on his back during the
seven-minute scrum. Reds starting pitcher Johnny Cueto, who will be suspended
for seven games for kicking the Redbirds catcher and pitcher, draws the
wrath of his opponents for lashing out with his spikes during the altercation.

2014
After rallying from a 5-0 deficit, the Blue Jays win the longest game in
franchise history when Jose Bautista's single in the bottom of the 19th
inning drives in Munenori Kawasaki, giving Toronto a 6-5 walk-off victory
