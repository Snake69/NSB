1902
Little Tommy Leach of Pittsburgh, never considered a long-ball threat,
hits 2 HRs over the fence at Boston in a 6-1 win. He will close out the
season with only 6, but it is enough to give him sole leadership of the NL,
which totals only 99 homers. Leach's leading number is the lowest since
Paul Hines hit 4 in a 60-game schedule in 1878.

1903
In Detroit, Cy Young picks up his 20th win as Boston wins, 6-3.

1908

5-2. New York has now won 9 in a row, but Chicago will stop that tomorrow.

Phils, 2-1. It is Pete's first loss to Pittsburgh.

Tris Speaker runs his hit streak to 20 straight games, lining a hit in game
1 of today's twinbill with the Browns. This is Speaker's 3rd long streak
of the season; earlier he had streaks of 20 games and 30 games, the only
player in history to do so. In the nitecap, Smoky Joe Wood wins his 25th,
beating the Browns, 8-0. He allows 4 hits and strikes out 9.

In game 1 against Vean Gregg, Stuffy McGinnis has 2 inside-the-park
homeruns to pace the A's to an 8-3 win over Cleveland. Philadelphia takes
the nitecap, 2-0.

William H. Locke, who bought the 2nd-place Phils earlier this year, dies. His
cousin William Baker will succeed him.

At the Polo Grounds, the Pirates broadside Mathewson for 8 hits and 8
runs in just 3 innings. Wagner goes 4 for 5 on the afternoon with two hits
off Matty ... one a single and the other a 3-run homer. The only time the
Giants get Hans out is when a pitch hits his bat as he tries to get out of
the way and the ball rolls fair. The Giants make a game of it, but lose 8-6.

1914
The Braves pound another 11 hits, off Jeff Tesreau, and the Braves beat the
Giants, 7-3. Bill James is the winner with help from Connolly, who belts

Grounds. New York's Ferdie Schupp takes the opener, 5-4, and ex-Giant Rube
Marquard wins the 2nd game for Brooklyn, 3-1. A highlight of the nitecap
is a fight between Brooklyn Casey Stengel and Giant SS Art Fletcher.

1918
Sailor Burleigh Grimes pitches Brooklyn to a 4-2 win over the Phils. The
Phils take the lead, but veteran Jimmy Archer relieves young Mack Wheat behind
the plate in the 5th and Grimes' spitball works to perfection after that.

1919
In a total of two hours seventeen minutes, the Dodgers and Cubs split a
doubleheader. In the opener, the Cubs blank Brooklyn, 2-0, in one hour 10
minutes and in the nightcap it takes the Dodgers one hour 7 minutes to shut
out Chicago, 1-0.

In Chicago, Babe Ruth hits his 17th homerun, the first of seven homers in
12 days, which will include his fourth grand slam, setting an AL record
until 1959. Today's homer, in the 7th-inning off Erskine Mayer, clears the
RF wall and lands in a soccer field. Chicago White Sox CF Happy Felsch ties
the ML record with 4 assists, but Boston beats the White Sox, 15-6.

With the score tied 3-3 in the top of the 10th, starting Yankee hurler
Carl Mays is called out on strikes by Brick Owens. In disgust, Mays flings
his bat towards the stands and is thumbed out of the game before the bat
lands. The Yankees overcome Muddy Ruel's hitting into a triple play -
2B Ralph Young to SS Donie Bush - and beat the Tigers in 15 innings, 5-4.

1921
The Browns open their home stand with a 7-5 win over Detroit. George Sisler
continues his hot hitting going 4 for 4.

1922
Lizzie Murphy of the Providence All-Stars, plays 1B for an AL All-Star
team in an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox, making her the
first female to play for a ML team. Other All-Stars are Chick Shorten,
Tillie Walker, Frank Bruggy, Bootnose Hoffman, Jim Bagby, Nick Altrock
and Donnie Bush. The All-Stars win 3-2 when Doc Johnson triples home Pep
Young in the 10th. The proceeds benefit the family of former Sox player
and manager Tommy McCarthy. The future Hall of Famer passed away August 5.

1924
Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance stops the Reds, 3-0, on 3 hits and reaches 20
wins. His 7 strikeouts gives him a NL-high 177.

1928
Pete Alexander returns from an illness to pitch the Cards to a 6-1 win over
the Braves. Alex scatters 7 hits, including 2 by Hornsby, who is leading
the NL at .381, 21 points ahead of Paul Waner. Goslin and Simmons are tied
in the AL at .380, with Gehrig 3rd at .369.

The Reds release submariner Carl Mays (4-1) who has been suffering from
neuritis. The Giants will sign the veteran before next season.

A's pitching jinx Elam Van Gilder. The Bengals tally 3 runs off starter
Howard Ehmke.

The Babe hits his 44th homer in the first inning, but the White Sox tie
in the 3rd enroute to a 5-2 win over the visiting Yankees. Ruth is now 13
games ahead of last year's pace.

in the field, hits 3 singles and a HR, and steals home in a 17-13 win over

ML game. He relieves Van Mungo in the 9th after Johnny Frederick hits a
pinch-hit HR off Carl Hubbell in the 9th to tie at 1-1. The Dodgers win in
the 10th when Tony Cuccinello drives home Hack Wilson for Brooklyn's 4th
straight win over the Giants. The pinch homer is Frederick's 4th pinch-hit
HR of the year, for a new ML record. He will have 6 by the season's end. The
Giants win the nitecap, 8-4, as Bill Terry and Mel Ott belt homers.

Cardinals rookie Dizzy Dean fans 6 Cubs in a row, one less than the record,
and wins 2-1 in the 10th in game 2. The Cards also win the opener, 2-0.

The Senators knock out Lefty Gomez in the 9th, but the Yankee ace still wins
his 20th, 5-4. Babe Ruth starts the game's scoring with his 33rd homer in
the 4th, and adds a double and a single.

1933
Jimmie Foxx hits for the cycle, including a grand slam, and drives in 9
runs to break the AL record, as the A's beat the Indians 11-5. A record 8
players will hit for the cycle this year.

In the bottom of the 9th at Yankee Stadium, pitcher Red Ruffing breaks a 2-2
tie by clouting a grand-slam homerun off Red Sox hurler Bob "Lefty" Weiland.

The Deans are suspended by the Cards and Dizzy is charged for 2 uniforms
he tore up - the 2nd for the benefit of the photographers.

The largest weekday crowd in history, 77000, watch as the Tigers sweep a
pair at Yankee Stadium, winning 9-5 and 7-3. Schoolboy Rowe tops Red Ruffing
in the nitecap, 7-3, for his 13th win in a row. Rowe allows just 4 hits,
including Gehrig's 37th HR. Gehringer has a HR in each game to lead the
Tigers to their 14th win in a row. The Yanks now trail by 6 1/2 games.

1935
The largest midweek crowd in NL history, 50868, sees the Giants and Cards
split at the Polo Grounds, the Giants winning 6-4, then losing 3-0. Carl
Hubbell takes the opener, spoiling Paul Dean's 22nd birthday, as Jack
Rothrock, Joe Moore, Terry Moore, Pepper Martin and Gus Mancuso homer. The
Giants outhit the Cards, ten to five, in the nitecap, but lose to Bill
Hallahan. Castleman loses his first decision after six straight wins.

Detroit's Schoolboy Rowe beats the Senators, 18-2, and also goes 5 for 5
at the plate. His hits include a double and a triple, and he scores 3 and
knocks in 3. The first-place Tigers score 6 in the 2nd and another 6 in the
4th off Buck Newsom and now lead the Yankees by six. New York loses to the
Indians today, 7-6.

1936
At the Polo Grounds, the NL's 60th anniversary is celebrated with the
appearance of stars of the 1870s and a 3-inning recreated game between the
'Knockerbockers' and the 'Atlantics' under the old rules. Thousands watch as
a parade starts on 110th and Lenox featuring horse-drawn carriages, buses
and shays. The parade continues to and inside the Polo Grounds. Oldtimers
on hand include Arlie Latham, Jim Mutrie, Mickey Welch, Jocko Fields,
Dick Rudolph, Otto Knabe, Hans Lobert, Charley Bassett, Jimmy Ring, Bill
Coughlin, Danny Murphy and Doc Kennedy. Mutrie and Bill Terry meet at home
plate and discuss the differences in the game, with Mutrie saying there
was little fundamental change. Mayor LaGuardia looks on from a box decked
out in bunting. Today's game under regular rules is won by the Giants, 3-0,
over the Phillies. Slick Castleman pitches his lone shutout of the year.

The home park of the Western League Omaha team burns down shortly after an
exhibition game between two semi-pro teams.

1937
At Detroit, Tigers P Eldon Auker hits two HRs and drives home 5 runs while
beating the Browns, 16-1 on 4 hits. Detroit continues in game two, winning,
20-7, scoring an AL record 36 runs in the doubleheader (the record will be
broken by Texas on August 23, 2007 scoring 39 times), including eight by
Pete Fox. The Tigers score in every inning of each game except the 8th, not
batting in the 9th. Charlie Gehringer hits a pair of homers in the nitecap,
Rudy York adds his 5th homer of the month, and Boots Poffenberger coasts home
to the win. Gee Walker, Pete Fox and Charlie Gehringer each collect 7 hits
in the twinbill. Gehringer's 5 hits in the nitecap is his only 5-hit game
this season. Browns utility infielder Nog Lipscomb mops up in each game,
pitching a total of 7 2/3 innings, allowing 6 earned runs. The Tigers pound
40 hits in the twinbill and move into 2nd place, ten games behind the Yankees.

after Dick West had driven in 2 runs with his first ML hit.

1940
Cleveland's Al Smith pitches a one hitter in beating the White Sox, 4-0,
for his 13th victory. A 3rd-inning single is the only safety.

1942
The Yankees turn a ML-record 7 DPs in an 11-2 win over the Athletics. Bill
Dickey guns down 2 runners following third strikes, three are started by
the DP combo of Rizzuto and Gordon, reliever Johnny Murphy triggers another,
and 3B Red Rolfe initiates one. The 7 DPs give the Yankees 150 on the year;
they'll finish with 190, just missing the (since surpassed) ML mark they
set last season of 194.

1945
Cleveland's Lou Boudreau suffers a broken right ankle in a collision at
2B with Dolf Camilli, but the Tribe beats the Red Sox, 3-0, behind Jim

Dodgers reward their fans by winning both games, 8-4 and 2-1.

1948
Rookie George Vico drives in 7 runs to pace the Tigers to a 10-3 win over the

Before 60,120, the Indians turn back the Tigers, 3-2, in 10 innings, and
reduce Detroit's 1st-place advantage to 2 1/2 games. Al Rosen had tied the
game in the 9th with a 2-out HR. RF Bob Kennedy helps the Tribe's cause
by starting a triple play from the outfield, recalling Tribe LF Charlie
Jamieson's 2 triple plays of 1928.

1951
In a night game at the Polo Grounds - the last of 14 night games this year -
the Giants' righty George Spencer beats the Dodgers, 4-2. Erv Palica takes
the loss as the Giants jump on him early. Al Dark doubles and comes home on
Don Mueller's homer. An out later, Whitey Lockman homers and Palica doesn't
make the 2nd inning. The Dodgers score in the 8th on successive homers by
Cox and Snider.

1952
In a major trade, the Tigers send 5 players to the Browns, including
pitchers Dick Littlefield and Marlin Stuart, slugger Vic Wertz and OF Don
Lenhardt. Detroit receives OF Jim Delsing and 3 pitchers:  Ned Garver, Dave
Madison and Bud Black. The nod goes to Detroit on this swap as Delsing will
start in CF and Garver will be a reliable starter. In 1951, Garver became
the century's only 20-game winner with a team losing 100 games. He also
led the Brownies with a .305 batting average.

1954
Dodgers slugger Duke Snider fans twice in the 6th inning of a game against
the Giants, as the Dodgers score 4 in the 6th to come back and win, 6-5.

After a two-inning Old-Timer's game, the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 3-1. The
win goes to Ralph Branca, his first and only decision in a Yankee uniform. The
Old-Timers match features 18 Hall of Famers, and is won by the AL on Joe
DiMaggio's 3-run homer off Carl Hubbell. Mel Ott has a homer for the NL.

A story issued by the Associated Negro Press and printed in today's
Philadelphia Independent says:  "Abe Saperstein of the fabulous Harlem
Globetrotters stated this week in a press interview that baseball magnate
Bill Veeck had intended to use a baseball trick back in 1942 which would have
upset the thinking in the major league, had it materialized. 'I'll tell you
one thing about Veeck,' said Saperstein, 'something that few people know. In
1942 the Phillies were for sale and Veeck attempted to buy them. But Bill
Cox raised more money and got the club. Do you know what Veeck planned to
do? He was going to take the Phils to spring training in Florida and then -
on the day the season opened - dispose of the entire team. Meanwhile, with
a team composed entirely of Negroes, who would have trained separately,
he could have opened the National League season. I don't think there was
a team in either league, back in 1943, that could have stopped the team he
was going to assemble.'"

1955
Cardinals manager Harry Walker pulls a shift by moving P Tom Poholsky to
LF and bringing in lefty Luis Arroyo to face slugger Ted Kluszewski of
the Redlegs. Big Klu foils the manager by homering. The Cards rally to win
anyway, 5-4.

At Baltimore, the Yanks overcome a muddy ball field, the result of Hurricane

steals home twice in one game. His first home theft is in the 8th. The third
baseman's tenth-inning theft of the dish ends the game giving the Indians a
10-9 'slide-off' victory over the Tigers. Power becomes the first AL player
since 1927 to steal home twice in the same game.

Manager Birdie Tebbetts of the Reds resigns. Jimmy Dykes takes over as
interim manager.

The 7th place Dodgers draw just 6,195, the smallest regular-season crowd in
LA history, as Don Drysdale tops the Cubs, 7-3, at the Coliseum. Duke Snider

6,559, will show up on September 13, 1976.

Cards' Bill White hits for the cycle in the opener.

The Yankees lose a doubleheader to Washington and fall to 3rd place in the AL,
a half game behind the Orioles and White Sox. P Camilo Pascual's grand slam
is the difference in a 5-4 first-game win. In the 2nd game, Mickey Mantle,
believing there are 2 outs, jogs to 1B on a grounder to 3B. The Senators
turn a DP, with New York's Roger Maris suffering bruised ribs trying to
break it up at 2B. Maris will miss 18 games as a result. Mantle is heavily
booed, and Casey Stengel replaces him with Bob Cerv. The clubs set a ML
record by using 17 pinch hitters - 9 by the Yankees - in the doubleheader
(more than 18 innings), while playing a ML record 24 errorless innings.

1961

2-1. The homer streak will end tomorrow in Los Angeles, when he delivers
a pinch single against Bob Miller.

The Yanks sweep two from the Indians, winning the nitecap, 6-4. The Indians
help in the 2nd game by making six errors in one inning, one short of the
record. Mantle helps with a homer, off lefty Jack Kralick, but he'll sit
the next 12 days after reinjuring his knee.

1967

1971
Ten days after his 200th victory and before 30,678 Pittsburgh fans,
Cardinals ace Bob Gibson, 35, hurls the first no-hitter of his career, an
11-0 shellacking of the Pirates. The Cards make it easy for Gibson by scoring
5 runs in the top of the first inning. Gibson walks 3 and strikes out 10
(three of those Ks are to Willie Stargell, including the final out), and
paces the offense with 3 RBIs. Outstanding defensive plays were made during
the game by outfielder Jose Cruz and third baseman Joe Torre. Gibson said
after the game, "This was the greatest game I've ever pitched anywhere." The
win, Gibson's 48th career shutout, improves his record to 11-10 and moves

in the 2nd by Claudell Washington.

inducted into the Hall of Fame, played as an embattled right fielder for
the Bronx Bombers from 1977-81, helping the club reach the post-season four
times, including winning two world championships.

1995
The Red Sox trade OF Wes Chamberlain to the Royals in exchange for OF
Chris James.

Marlins OF Andre Dawson, in his 21st major league season, announces he will
retire at the end of the year.

Giants infielder Shawon Dunston is operated on and will miss the remainder
of the season. Dunston suffered a head injury on August 4 in a collision
with Astro SS Ricky Gutierrez.

The Braves bring up Andruw Jones. He is believed to be the first player
since Phils pitcher Pat Combs in 1989 to start a season in A ball, play in
AA, triple A, and the majors in the same season.

1997
The Indians best the Tigers, 12-1, in the 15,000th game in franchise
history. The Tigers are the only other American League team to have played
as many contests.

The Twins trade 1B Greg Colbrunn to the Braves in exchange for a player to
be named.

1998
A's Rickey Henderson's stolen base in the first-inning against the Tigers
makes the 39-year-old the oldest player to steal 50 bases in a season.

In a 15-3 rout of the Indians at Jacobs Field, Chris Hoiles becomes the
ninth player in major league history and the only catcher to hit two grand
slams in one game. The Orioles backstop goes yard with the bases full in the
third inning off Charles Nagy and does it again in the eighth off Ron Villone.

1999
With Pudge's 20th stolen base in Chicago, Texas backstop Ivan Rodriguez
becomes the first catcher in major league history with 20 homers and 20
stolen bases in the same season.

Oakland scores 8 runs in the 1st inning on their way to a 13-5 win over
Toronto.

Boston defeats Seattle, 13-2, as rookie DH Brian Daubach goes 5 for 5,
including a HR, and drives home 6 runs. In yesterday's 11-6 win, he was
3 for 5 with a HR and two doubles. Pedro Martinez (17-3) is the winner,
pitching the last 4 innings and giving up one run, Alex Rodriguez' 30th HR.

The Rockies and Expos combine to hit 10 HRs in Colorado's 11-8 victory. Four
players - Montreal's Geoff Blum and Colorado's Edgard Clemente, Todd Helton
and Dante Bichette - each hit a pair, while Jose Vidro and Rondell White
also connect. It is only the 3rd time in major league history that 4 players
have each hit 2 HRs in the same game.

2000
The Tigers score 8 runs in the 5th inning and go on to defeat the Mariners,
15-4.

2001
Craig Biggio hits a leadoff homer for the second straight game - a feat he
did earlier in the year - but that is all the scoring for the Astros as 5
Cubs pitchers shut them down to win, 3-1.

2002
Reds C Jason LaRue has a bad first inning with knuckleballer Jared Fernandez
on the mound, and allows 3 consecutive passed balls and a run scoring wild
pitch. LaRue will lead the majors this year with 20 passed balls. The
Diamondbacks break a tie in the 6th as Womack singles off reliever John
Riedling to win, 7-2, their 18th out of 22 games. Luis Gonzales misses the
game because of a strained rib cage, and breaks his ML high streak of 446
consecutive games played.

Two contests in the AL go 14 innings. Geronimo Gil hits a 2-out 14th inning
homer to give Baltimore a 6-5 victory over Minnesota, while the Yankees
overcome a straight steal of home by Mike Sweeney to beat the Royals,
3-2. Bernie Williams hits an RBI single to give Ramiro Mendoza (8-3) the win.

2003
Despite a massive blackout in the northeast, the game between the Mets and
the Giants at Shea Stadium is the only postponement on the major league
schedule. Although Detroit, Toronto and Cleveland were without electricity,
the Tigers, Blue Jays and Indians either had the day off or were playing
on the road.

In an 8-3 win over the Twins, Travis Hafner of the Cleveland Indians became
the 22nd major-leaguer to hit for the cycle as a rookie. He barely legs out
a triple in his final at-bat becoming the first Indian to cycle since Andre
Thornton in 1978. The first rookie to hit for a cycle was Bill Van Dyke in
1890 while playing for the American Association's Toledo Maumees. Brian
Anderson is the winner with 8 1/3 IP. The Twins, who were shutout in 14
innings yesterday, score 3 meaningless runs in the bottom of the 9th.

2004
The Florida State Leagues' Daytona Cubs will be forced to shift their home
games into away contests as Hurricane Charley causes extensive damage to
their historic ballpark. The facility, which was built in 1914 and renamed
for Jackie Robinson to commemorate the site where the future Hall of Famer
and civil rights advocate played his first exhibition game with the Montreal
Royals, was also damaged by Hurricane Donna (1966) and Hurricane Floyd (1999).

2005
Tampa Bay's Travis Lee cracks a pinch hit homerun off Bob Wickman for the
game's only score and TB beats Cleveland, 1-0. This is just the 3rd time
a solo pinch homer has accounted for the only score (Bill Taylor in 1954
and Candy Maldonado in 1985).

The Red Sox defeat the Blue Jays, 5-3. David Ortiz hits his 42nd HR of the
season for Boston. It is his 38th as a designated hitter, setting a new ML
record. Edgar Martinez held the previous mark of 37 set in 2000.

The Phillies beat the Braves, 12-4, despite Andruw Jones' league-leading
50th HR of the season, and 300th of his career. By doing so, Jones becomes
the 12th player in ML history to reach 300 before his 30th birthday.

2006
The Braves pound the Nationals, 10-4. Matt Diaz has four hits and a walk in
his first 5 plate appearances and ties an NL record by getting a hit in 10
straight ABs. His streak ends with a ground out in the 9th inning. Chipper
Jones has four hits, including 3 consecutive HRs for Atlanta. Teammate Marcus
Giles held the previous franchise mark with nine straight safeties in 2003.

2007
For the 132nd time in his career, Altanta skipper Bobby Cox is ejected from
a major league game breaking John McGraw's all-time ejections record. It
took the Braves manager only 28 seasons to set the new mark compared to
the 42 years in which Mugsy compiled his tosses, including 14 as a player.

Phil Rizzuto, the oldest-living Hall of Famer, dies in his sleep at a New
Jersey nursing home from complications of pneumonia at the age of 89. Scooter,
who was enshrined at Cooperstown for outstanding play as a shortstop during
the Yankee dynasty years of the 1940's and 50's, became a popular icon in
New York as a result of his unique broadcasting style of Bronx Bomber games,
his appearance in numerous commercials as well as lending his voice on Meat
Loaf's "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights" rock hit which won a Grammy.

After being arrested for hitting two players with a bat, former big leaguer
Jose Offerman is suspended indefinitely by the independent Atlantic League for
the assault that occurred during a Bluefish and Long Island Ducks game. As
a result of the incident, triggered when the former All-Star is drilled by
a pitch after hitting a homer in his first at-bat, Bridgeport backstop John
Nathans sustains a concussion and starter Matt Beech suffers a broken finger.

2008
In the sixth inning of a 9-2 rout of the Royals, the White Sox becomes
the sixth team in major league history to hit four consecutive homeruns
in an inning. Jim Thome, Paul Konerko and Alexei Ramirez all go deep off
K.C. reliever Joel Peralta with Juan Uribe completing the record-tying feat
by taking Robinson Tejeda yard at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field.

With his 5 for 5 performance including two singles, a double, a triple
and a homer, Mark Kotsay joins Albert Hall as the only Atlanta players to
hit for the cycle. The outfielder's offensive outburst isn't enough as the
Cubs beat the Braves, 11-7, giving Chicago their first season sweep of the
Braves in franchise history which dates back to 1876.

2010 
Mike McClendon becomes the first rookie in Brewers' history to retire the
first nine batter he faces. The 25-year-old right-hander is perfect in the
sixth, seventh and eighth frames in Milwaukee's eventual 5-4 ten-inning
victory over Colorado at Coors Field.

2015
The Padres' Matt Kemp hits a ninth-inning triple to complete the cycle,
making him the first player in the 35-year history of the franchise to
accomplish the feat. The San Diego outfielder's homerun in the first,
single in the third and double in the seventh contributes to the team's
9-5 victory over Colorado at Coors Field.

2017
Giancarlo Stanton of Miami set the franchise record for homeruns in a season
by hitting his 43rd homerun in the first inning against the San Francisco
Giants. He broke the record that was set by Gary Sheffield in 1996.
