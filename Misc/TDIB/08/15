In the battle for 2nd place in the NL, the Pirates and Giants split two,
each by 2-1 scores. In the opener, Lefty Leifield and Christy Mathewson match

1912
Little-known Guy Zinn, Yankees outfielder, steals home twice in a 5-4 win at

home. The Yankees will win tomorrow, 9-8, when Zinn hits a 9th-inning double.

Philadelphia A's Rube Waddell pitches a five-inning no-hit game blanking
the Browns, 2-0.

At the Polo Grounds, 32,000 watch as Lefty Tyler and Christy Mathewson throw

the nitecap to win his 2nd game of the day.

1916
At Fenway, Boston's Babe Ruth outduels Senators' ace Walter Johnson, winning
1-0 in 13 innings. Johnson allows just 5 hits through 12 innings, while Ruth
surrenders just an infield single - by Clyde Milan in the 11th - from the
7th inning on. Milan also robs Ruth of a homer in the 12th by grabbing a
ball heading into the RF stands. Ruth is now 3-0 in his meetings with Johnson.

to four pennants.

1920

Senators southpaw George Mogridge becomes the only hurler to steal home in
extra innings when he scores an insurance run in the 12th in a 5-1 win over
the White Sox.

1925
Little Dickie Kerr, the southpaw who won 2 games for the White Sox in the
1919 WS, makes his first ML appearance since 1921. He has been playing
semipro ball rather than accept Charles Comiskey's salary offer. When he
relieves Red Faber in the 3rd inning against the Tigers, play is stopped
while admirers present him with a floral horseshoe. In 2 innings, he gives
up 3 hits and walks 2. The White Sox go on to win, 12-5. Kerr starts twice,
loses once, and after 10 relief chores, quits for good.

1926
Three runners on third! The Braves are at Ebbets Field with Brooklyn's Hank
DeBerry on 3B, Dazzy Vance on 2B and Chick Fewster on 1B, when Babe Herman
drives a vicious liner against the RF wall that caroms back towards the
second baseman, Doc Gautreau. DeBerry scores, but Vance initially holds up,
then rounds 3B headed for home. Fewster stops at 3B. Gautreau throws home and
traps Vance, who heads back to 3B. Herman slides into 3B joining the crowd,
as Fewster steps off. Herman is ruled out for passing a base runner. Fewster,
thinking he's out, too, walks off with Babe, and gets tagged out. Vance,
still on 3B, later admits it was his fault. Poor Herman, who thought he
had a triple but merely doubles into a double play, gets the blame. With
all that, the Robins sweep a pair from the Braves, winning 4-1 and 11-3.

The Browns split a pair with the Indians, winning 11-7 in game one with
the help of Wally Schang's grand slam. Bill Burns hits his 54th double

equal the ML record set by Pie Traynor.

1938
A bad day for Chicago as the Cards' Lon Warneke stops his old teammates,
8-4. Clay Bryant is the loser. Worse than their 2nd loss in a row is
losing player-manager Hartnett, who fractures his thumb when struck by a
Joe Medwick foul tip. Gabby will be sidelined for three weeks.

1940
Chicago ace Claude Passeau tosses a five-hitter and doesn't allow a runner
past first after the first inning as he beats the Reds, 1-0. Paul Derringer
takes the loss.

In a 4-2 loss to the Phillies, Dodger SS Pee Wee Reese fractures his heel bone
sliding into 2B and is out for the season. The Dodgers must like what they see
in winning pitcher Kirby Higbe, who will go to the Dodgers in the off-season.

1941
Because of rain, the game between the Red Sox and the Senators is stopped
in the 8th inning, with Washington ahead 6-3. After a 40-minute wait the
game is called. But because of Washington's failure to cover the field
in case play is resumed, Boston manager Joe Cronin protests the game. On
August 28th, the protest is upheld by league president Will Harridge, who
calls it "the case of the missing grounds keeper," and the forfeit goes to
Boston. Per the rules, there are no pitcher wins or losses.

1942
With 2 outs and 2 strikes in the last of the 9th, Dolf Camilli hits a 2-run
homer to give the Dodgers a 5-4 win over the Braves. With the homer, his
20th, Camilli takes over the NL lead.

lose two games to the Pirates, 8-5 and 8-7, the nitecap in 11 innings.

At Fenway the Sox sweep a pair from the Senators, winning each by one
run. In the opening 2-1 win, Ted Williams' 2-run homer backs Tex Hughson's
9th straight win and 15th overall. The 7-6 nitecap win goes to Broadway
Charlie Wagner, whose last 6 wins, since June 7, have all been by one run,
including a pair of 1-0 wins. Lou Finney drives in the tying and winning
runs with a triple.

1944
The Giants blow a 3-2 lead in losing to the Reds, 6-3, and manager Bill
Terry fines Buddy Kerr and Joe Medwick $100 each for mental errors. Kerr
was slow in returning to his position after a pickoff attempt and the next
batter singled; Medwick's catch in left was ruled a trapped ball. Joe then
raced in to show the ump the ball while two Cincy runners scored.

1945
The Cubs rack up 19 hits, including 2 homers by Gillespie, one with the bases
full, to swamp the Dodgers, 20-6. Chicago scores 8 in the 4th inning with
the first 8 batters reaching base before an out is recorded. Hank Borowy
coasts to the win.

Commissioner Happy Chandler sells WS radio rights for $150,000 to
Gillette. Ford had been the WS sponsor since 1934, paying $100,000 annually.

Umpire Ernie Stewart is canned by AL President Will Harridge for
"disloyalty." Stewart had complained about the pay and taken his case to
Chandler. Bill McGowan is the top-paid umpire in the league at $9,000.

1946
Behind the timely hitting of Miksis and Walker the Dodgers win, 7-1, to
sweep their 4-game series with the Giants. Higbe is the winner allowing
3 hits. Catcher Bruce Edwards ties a ML record when, in the 4th inning he
makes assists on 3 consecutive plays ... he is the first National League
catcher to do it. Da Bums now lead the idle Cards by 2 games.

1948
Before 72,468 - the largest crowd of the season at Yankee Stadium - the A's
sweep a pair from the Yanks by 5-3 scores and regain second place in the
AL. The A's win the opener in 10 innings after Joe DiMaggio ties the score
with his 20th homer of the year. Joe D also triples home a run in the extra
frame but Lou Brissie preserves the win for Carl Scheib. The A's total 20
hits in the two games, including a triple and a double by Sam Chapman. New
York is now in 4th place, five games back.

In the first of two at Philadelphia, Ken Heintzelman tosses a one-hitter to
beat the Giants, 8-1. The only hit is Whitey Lockman's 7th-inning triple. The
Phils take the nitecap, 7-5, as Ed Heusser pitches 5 innings of relief to
win. Larry Jansen and Clint Hartung take the losses.

1949
Reports of clubhouse troubles trail the Braves all season. Owner Lou Perini
prevails on manager Billy Southworth to take a leave of absence with the
team at 55-54. The team will spurt briefly under Johnny Cooney but finish
under .500 in 4th place. Braves players vote Southworth only a half-share
of last year's Series earnings but Happy Chandler restores the full share.

1950
The Red Sox defeat the Athletics, 8-3 and 9-4, to begin a streak in which
they reel off 27 of 30, propelling themselves back into the pennant race. Walt
Dropo is hospitalized, however, after being beaned by the A's Hank Wyse.

1951
Giants P Jim Hearn defeats the Dodgers 3-1 as Willie Mays makes a miraculous
play in the 8th. With the score 1-1 and Billy Cox on 3rd, Mays makes a running
catch of a Carl Furillo drive in deep right CF and whirls counterclockwise
to throw out the astonished Cox at home. Wes Westrum's 2-run homer off Ralph
Branca in the 8th provides the two-run margin. Hearn allows just six hits,
all singles, as the Giants move to 10 1/2 behind Brooklyn.

Al Rosen belts a first-inning grand slam to jump start the Indians to a 9-4
win over the Browns, their 13th in a row. For Rosen, it is his 4th slam of

road against one opponent started on August 13, 1952 when the franchise
was played as the St. Louis Browns.

Gene Conley wins his 9th straight game beating the Cubs 2-1 in Milwaukee. The

in game 2 and sweep the doubleheader to move back into first.

off Card P Mel Wright. Spahn has now hit a HR in every National League park.

1956
The Dodgers and Giants draw 26,385 for a night-game record at Jersey City. A
4th-inning Willie Mays HR, the only ball hit out of Roosevelt Stadium,
is the only scoring as Johnny Antonelli shuts out the Dodgers, 1-0. He
strikes out 11 and allows 2 hits. The loss goes to Don Newcombe who had
pitched three straight shutouts and won 9 straight. The loss is the Brooks
first at Jersey City after 6 straight wins.

Frank Robinson ends a battle with the Cubs by driving in a run in the 15th
inning as the Reds win, 4-3, in the lidlifter at Wrigley. Jeffcoat pitches

Cards, in first place on August 5, have now lost 9 straight.

Hazle has another 3 hits, including a homer, as Milwaukee tops Cincy again,
8-1. Aaron has a pair of homers and Eddie Mathews a solo shot as the Braves
extend their winning streak to 10 games and their lead to 8 1/2. It is
Milwaukee's 14th win in 16 games with the Reds and, for Warren Spahn,
it extends his record to 44-14 over the Reds. Cincy's only run is unearned.

1960
Behind Art Ditmar's 5-hitter and Mickey Mantle's 2 HRs, off Jerry Walker
and Hoyt Wilhelm, New York cops a 4-3 win and first place in the AL. The

by a half-game.

In the first of 2 games at Crosley Field, Frank Robinson and Eddie Mathews
exchange punches after Robbie slides in hard at 3B in the 7th inning. Robbie
comes out on the short end with a swollen eye, bloody nose, and jammed thumb,

but is thrown out at 1B by RF Frank Robinson. Announcer Vin Scully says,
"Sandy forgot to run."

1962
Pinch-hit HRs by the Mets Choo Choo Coleman (6th inning) and Jim Hickman
(8th) tie the ML record for pinch HRs by one club in one game, but the Mets
still lose to the Phils, 8-7, in 13 innings. Winning pitcher Chris Short
singles and scores the winning run. The Phils cop the opener, 9-3 behind
a Callison homer and two by Don Demeter, both off Bob Millers. The first
Miller serves up a homer in the 3rd and the other Bob Miller in the 9th.

Trailing 1-0 going into the 9th, the White Sox score 10 runs on 6 hits,
a walk and an error and win, 10-2. Only the 1912 Reds have scored 10 runs
in the 9th inning of a game. Cleveland comes back in the nitecap to win,
3-2, as Jim Perry bests Early Wynn.

1965
With pregame festivities celebrating his appearance as the first Japanese
player in a major league game completed, Masanori Murakami, normally
a reliever, starts the game. In a 15-9 Giants win over the Phillies at
Candlestick Park, the southpaw from Otsuki pitches 2 1/3 innings allowing
four hits and three earned runs while striking out four.

In the nightcap of a Cleveland Stadium doubleheader, Indians pinch-hitter
Max Alvis hits a two-run homer in the ninth to knot the score at 3-3,
and two innings later, Leon Wagner, also pinch hitting, blasts a two-run

1970
With the bases loaded and one gone in the bottom of the ninth with a 2-1
lead, Tom Seaver strikes out Bob Tillman for the apparent second out, but
Jerry Grote's passed ball allows Tony Gonzalez to score the tying run for
the Braves. In his effort to cut down the runner at home, the Mets' catcher
overthrows Seaver, who is covering the plate, bringing in Rico Carty from
third base with the winning tally giving Atlanta a stunning 3-2 victory,
thanks to the two runs being scored on a called third strike.

In a 5-4 Reds win over the Phillies, Lee May drives in all the runs for
Cincinnati. His 2nd homer in the bottom of the 9th ties the game and his
single in the 14th wins it. Rose (the defending NL batting champ) is 0 for
7 with 5 straight K's. The Phils' Billy Champion is the losing pitcher,
but all is not lost. Champion picks up a PCL win today as Eugene completes
a suspended game in which he is the victor.

and becomes the first Boston player since Ted Williams in 1939 to hit 20

1978
The Blue Jays trade DH Rico Carty to the A's for DH Willie Horton and a
minor league pitcher.

Braves Bob Horner, who was hitting .303 with 20 HRs and 68 RBIs, breaks
his right wrist sliding into 2B during a 4-0 loss to the Padres and will
be sidelined for the rest of the season. In Atlanta, the injury is widely
attributed to the "Chief Noc-A-Homa Jinx," which seems to strike whenever the
Braves remove their mascot's outfield teepee in order to sell more tickets.

one hit shy of the ML record while being shut out.

1990

a ten-inning victory over the Red Sox, 6-2. 'Big Mac' becomes the first
player to hit thirty homeruns in each of his first four seasons.

Phillies southpaw Terry Mulholland spins the major leagues' 8th no-hitter
of the season. Mulholland faces the minimum 27 batters in blanking the
Giants 6-0, as just one runner reaches base on a throwing error by Charlie
Hayes. The baserunner is erased by a DP. Hayes makes the last putout by
grabbing a Gary Carter line drive. John Kruk also makes a crucial play
by reaching into the stands to pull back a one-out popup by Matt Williams
in the 8th. The eighth no-hitter of the season is a record surpassing the
previous record of seven set in 1908 and tied in 1917.

shoulder-length hair, but the Yankees still beat Kansas City, 5-1. He will
get a haircut two days later, and the hair will eventually be auctioned off
for $3,000 to benefit a children's charity. Mattingly is not alone. Steve
Farr, Matt Nokes and Pascual Perez have all been told their hair length
violates club policy. Mel Hall, who wears his hair in a small ponytail
before and after games, is warned his appearance is "borderline."

1992
Expos P Mark Gardner becomes the 1st NL pitcher since 1954 to hit 3 batters
in a single inning, as he hits the Cardinals' Ray Lankford, Andres Galarraga
and Luis Alicea. The Cardinals win, 6-4.

1, 1990.

Sheffield belts his 34th homer for the Fish.

P Bobby Seay, the top pick of the Chicago White Sox in the June draft, is
declared a free agent after the team fails to tender him a formal contract

the 1st player in the 32-year history of the draft to be declared a free
agent in the summer he was selected.

but the Reds win 6-4.

1999
The Angels defeat the Tigers, 10-2, as Chuck Finley becomes the first pitcher

previously fanned 4 Yankees in Anaheim's game with the New Yorkers on May
12. Both instances occurred in the 1st inning.

The Mets defeat the Giants, 12-5, behind Kenny Rogers' complete-game

in the first, homers in the third, doubles in the fourth and completes the
feat with a triple in the sixth inning. The Giants down the Reds, 7-3. It
is Winn's first appearance at SF's Great American Ball Park since being
obtained in a trade with the Mariners on July 30.

Felix Hernandez becomes the first teenager to strike out at least 10 batters
since Dwight 'Doc' Gooden accomplished the feat with the Mets in May of

maul the Royals, 11-3.

2006
With the 4-0 blanking of the Marlins, the Dodgers win their sixth consecutive
game and 17th in 18 games. The stretch is the team's best run since the
Brooklyn Superbas went 20-1 in 1899.

Huh? Trailing Oakland, 9-2, in the bottom of the 6th, Seattle's Jake Woods
intentionally walks Jay Payton with one out to load the bases for Nick
Swisher, who is 3 for 3 with 4 RBIs. The dubious strategy pays off when
Swisher swishes, but Marco Scutaro then draws a walk to drive home one of his
four runs in the game. Kirk Saarloos is the winner in the 11-2 A's victory.

In Anaheim's 9-7 win over Texas, an argument in the 4th inning results in

(3) and Angels 2B Adam Kennedy (4), Ps Brendan Donnelly (4) and Kevin Gregg
(3) and manager Mike Scioscia (3) will all earn suspensions.

At Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies defeat the Mets, 11-4, despite 3 homers
by Jose Reyes. The 7th player to ever perform the feat for New York, Reyes
is the 8th player to homer from both sides of the plate in the same game
for the franchise. With the Mets bullpen depleted, Orlando Hernandez stays
in for 4 innings and gets cuffed around for all 11 runs, the most a Mets
starter has given up since Jack Fisher gave up 11 in 1967. Previous Mets to
homer three times in a game are Jim Hickman (1965), Dave Kingman (1978),
Caudell Washington (1980), Darryl Strawberry (1985), Gary Carter (1985)
and Edgardo Alfonzo (1999). All the trifectas are accomplished on the road.

Cubs pound starter Roger Clemens for 5 runs in 6 innings. Cesar Izturis has

and they throw 542 pitches. The teams combined to use 46 players with the
Cubs using their entire 25-man roster.

At Coors Field, the Diamondbacks edge the Rockies, 2-1, in 18 innings. It
is the first time in ML history that two games on the same day last 18
innings. The D'Backs and Rockies use 42 players including 15 hurlers
who throw 514 pitches. The game takes five-hours 21-minutes to complete.
The 18-inning game ties the D-Back franchise record for the most innings
played in a game, and is also the longest in Colorado history for both
frames played and time of game.

The Nationals' Pedro Astacio, allowing two hits, and the Cards' Chris
Carpenter each throw 5-0 shutouts. Washington beats Atlanta and St. Louis
whips Cincinnati. Astacio, released in 2005 by the Rangers, is perfect for
4 2/3 innings, giving Washington its first complete game pitched this year.

Tigers 2B Placido Polanco suffers a separated shoulder and is expected to
be out for the rest of the season.

The morning before his scheduled rehab start for Columbus (IL) Yankees P
Carl Pavano is injured when his Porsche collides with a truck. Pavano, out
since June with various ailments, doesn't say anything about the accident
but pitches with discomfort before seeking medical help. An exam reveals
two fractured ribs. Pavano is in the 2nd year of a 4-year contract.

2007
The Devil Rays have come to terms with their first overall selection in
the June first-year player draft, left-handed pitcher David Price. The
Vanderbilt University (11-1, 2.63) southpaw signs a six-year major league
contract which could be worth as much as $11.25 million if the college
junior sticks in the bigs for the length of the deal.

2011
Buster Posey, the fifth overall pick in the June amateur draft, gets the
largest up-front bonus in major league history when he agrees to a $6.2
million signing deal with the Giants. The highly touted catcher gets slightly
more than infielders Tim Beckham (first pick/shortstop) who receives $6.15
million from the Rays and Pedro Alvarez (second pick/third baseman) who
gets $6 million from the Pirates.

At Petco Park, Jason Isringhausen becomes the 23rd major league pitcher
to record 300 career saves when the Mets defeat San Diego in 10 innings,
5-4. The 38-year-old right-handed closer is the third pitcher, along with
John Franco (1996) and Billy Wagner (2006), to achieve his 300th save
wearing a Mets uniform.

Jim Thome becomes the eighth player to reach the 600 career homeruns plateau
when he hits a two-run homer in the sixth (599), followed by a three-run
blast an inning later off Detroit's Daniel Schlereth. Needing fewer at-bats
to reach 600 than anyone except for Babe Ruth, the 40-year-old Twins slugger
accomplishes the feat in his 8,167th at-bat, compared to the Babino's 6,921.

2012
Joining Philip Humber (White Sox) and Matt Cain (Giants), Felix Hernandez
becomes the third hurler to throw a perfect game this season, marking the
first time in major league history that three spotless gems have been hurled
in the same year. "King Felix'" 1-0 victory over the Rays at Safeco Field
is the fourth no-hitter in Mariner history which includes hitless games
tossed by Randy Johnson (1990) and Chris Bosio (1993) and the combined
effort of six pitchers in June.

2013
A proposal that would dramatically increase the number of plays that can be
reviewed during a game is presented at the quarterly Owners Meetings by a
committee consisting of Braves president John Schuerholz and former major
league skippers Joe Torre and Tony La Russa. The rule change, which will be
formally voted on by the owners in November, will allow a manager to inform
an umpire that he wants to initiate a play review, with challenges being
permitted once in the first six innings and twice more from the seventh
through the end of the game, without any provision to cover the possibility
of an obviously missed call late in the game when all of a team's challenges
have been used.
