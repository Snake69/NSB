1901
Ban Johnson suspends Baltimore 1B Burt Hart for striking umpire John Haskell
yesterday, stating "This is the first time a player in the American League
has struck an umpire, and it is an offense that cannot be overlooked." The
31-year-old Hart will never play again.

The hits keep coming. In Cleveland, Milwaukee manager Hugh Duffy hits umpire
Al Mannassau when a fly ball nicking the foul line is called fair, scoring
the winning runs in a 5-4 win for the Blues. Duffy is suspended indefinitely.

In Boston's 10-5 win in game 1 at Baltimore, the Bostons pull off a triple
play. Pitcher Lewis starts the TP, which goes to Jimmy Collins (3B),
Schreckengost (C), Ferriss (2B) and Parent (SS). The Orioles take game
2, 10-4.

1902
For the 2nd time this year, Boston's Cy Young gives up 6 runs in the first
inning and is lifted. This time the Browns bomb him enroute to a 12-4
victory in St. Louis. Young will complete 41 of 43 starts this year. Former
teammate Emmet Heidrick is a pain for Boston, scoring 4 times on 4 long
hits - 2 doubles and 2 triples.

1903
The Giants sweep the Phillies at the Polo Grounds, taking the opener, 7-5,
behind Christy Mathewson. Matty surrenders 5 hits, but fans 10. Dummy Taylor
wins the nitecap, 6-2, to put the Giants back into 2nd place.

Reds SS Tommy Corcoran sets a ML mark when he records 14 assists in
Cincinnati's 4-2 regulation win over the Cardinals. Lave Cross, in 1897,
racked up 15 assists in a 12-inning game.

1904
The Giants swap outfielders sending rookie OF Moose McCormick (.266) west
to the Reds who in turn send him to Pittsburgh for Harry Sebring (269). The
Reds ship Mike Donlin (.356) to the Giants. Turkey Mike, sitting out a
month's suspension for drunken behavior in Chicago, will enjoy the New
York life style and being reunited with John McGraw, for whom he starred
at Baltimore, in 1901. He'll help the Giants win two straight pennants.

1906
On McGraw's orders, umpire Johnstone is refused admittance to the Polo
Grounds, and the ump, standing outside the Polo Grounds, forfeits the match
to the Cubs. McGraw insists the game go on with a player from each team
umpiring. McGraw picks reserve Sam Strang, but Cubs manager Frank Chance
refuses to go along, pointing out the game has already been forfeited. Strang
then forfeits the game to the Giants and Emslie, the appointed ump from
the Cubs, then forfeits the game to the Cubs.

1907
Senators hurler Walter Johnson wins his first major league game beating the
Indians, 7-2. The 'Big Train' will tally 417 victories during his 21-year
career. Cleveland manages just 4 hits.

The A's Socks Seybold socks a homer off Ed Killian to help beat the Tigers,
4-2. Killian had not given up a homer since September 19, 1903 - 1001
innings. He lost that game as well, and will tee up just 9 homers in his
short career.

1909
In St. Louis, the Giants shell Fred Beebe for 6 hits and 4 runs in the
first inning, and Christy Mathewson coasts to a 7-1 win.

1911
The matchup between Three Finger Brown and Christy Mathewson is something less
than a pitching duel as Chicago bangs out 10 hits, including two singles,
a double and a triple by Joe Tinker. Tinker also adds a steal of home. The
Giants collect 13 hits, but Chicago wins the game, 8-6.

1912
In a 7-2 loss to the Athletics, Browns manager-1B George Stovall makes 7
assists, topping Bill Brown's ML record of 6 in a game for Louisville in 1893.

At Pittsburgh, the Pirates win their 3rd straight against the leading Giants,
belting Christy Mathewson for 15 hits and 6 runs in 8 innings. Spitballer
Marty O'Toole allows 7 hits to win, 7-2.

1914
Grover Cleveland Alexander (16-9) shuts out the Reds and leads the Phillies
offense with 4 hits, including a double, and two runs scored.

1915
At Fenway, Smoky Joe Wood fires a one-hitter, beating Cleveland, 2-0. Bill
Wambsganss' single is the only Cleveland hit. For Wood, it is his 5th
one-hitter, and the 3rd over regulation distance.

In Chicago, the White Sox top the Senators, 6-2. Relieving for the losing
pitcher Jim Shaw is future Hall of Famer Sam Rice, who will pitch only 8 more
times before going to the outfield for two decades. Playing RF in the game
for Washington is Walter Johnson, filling in for the injured Danny Moeller.

Another Hall of Famer takes a turn on the mound, as George Sisler pitches
to two Yankees in the 6th inning, hitting one and walking the other. The
Browns-Yankees game is called at the end of 10 innings with the score
tied 4-4.

For the 2nd time in six weeks, Pirate hurler Al Mamaux combines to throw a
doubleheader shutout. This time his partner is Bob Harmon, as Mamaux stops
the Phils, 6-0, and Harmon follows with a 9-0 win.

At Redland Field, New York's Christy Mathewson pitches a 5-hitter to beat
Pete Schneider and the Reds, 5-4.

As Brooklyn's rookie pitcher steps to the mound, St. Louis manager Miller
Huggins, coaching at 3B, calls for the ball. The rookie obliges, Huggins
steps aside, and the Cardinal runner scores. A change in the rules will
prevent such trickery in the future.

1916
At St. Louis, the Browns score 2 runs in the 7th against Senators starter
Bert Gallia to tie the game. Ayers relieves and Walter Johnson pitches
the last 1 1/3 innings, allowing a tally in the 10th for a 3-2 St. Louis
win. The official scorer kindly gives the loss to Gallia.

The Braves whitewash the Reds twice, winning 2-0 and 6-0. Jesse Barnes and
Frank Allen are the winning pitchers. Fred Toney allows just 2 hits in the
first game loss.

In the 3rd inning against the Red Sox, White Sox P Reb Russell steals
home. Chicago wins, 7-1.

1918
The Yankees make it 7 straight losses, as the White Sox drop them twice
in Chicago, 8-4 and 4-0. New York makes 24 hits in the two games, but Ed
Cicotte is tough in the pinch to win the opener for the Sox. Slim Love takes
the loss. In the nitecap, Roy Sanders, making his first start for New York,
gives up no hits in the first 3 innings, but records no outs in the 4th
as the Sox rack him for 4 straight doubles. Frank Shellenback goes all the
way for the Sox win. Chicago now takes over 4th place from the Yankees.

Brooklyn slows the Cubs' victory drive by beating Chicago, 3-2, behind
Burleigh Grimes. All the Robins scoring comes on a 3-run homer by Mack Wheat
- his first in the majors - while his brother Zack has a single to stretch
his hitting streak to 26 games. Phil Douglas takes the loss for the Cubs.

1919
Before the start of the New York-St. Louis doubleheader at the Polo
Grounds, the Yankees present the umpires with a temporary court injunction
restraining Ban Johnson's order preventing Carl Mays from pitching, further
eroding Johnson's authority and standing. Mays then pitches a 6-hitter in
the nitecap, beating the Browns, 8-2. Mays' 9-3 record will be key to the
Yankees' 3rd place finish.

1921
The Cubs replace manager Johnny Evers with Bill Killefer. With Pete Alexander,
the former batterymate of "Reindeer Bill" on the mound, the Cubs lose to
the Giants, 7-2, at Cubs Park. New York third sacker Frankie Frisch is
knocked out by a deflected ground ball.

1922
Ken Williams hits 2 HRs (#29 and #30) in the 6th inning, off starter George
Mogridge and reliever Eric Erickson, as the Browns score 9 times against
Washington in a 16-1 win. Williams is the first to do so since Bobby Lowe
in 1894. Both homers follow doubles by Baby Doll Jacobson, also tying a ML
record, as the Browns establish a ML record (since 1893) of 7 extra base
hits in the frame. Jacobson also gets called out in the 1st inning for
batting out of turn.

A NL record ten Pirates collect 2 or more hits as the Pirates tally 22
hits to pound the 7th-place Phillies, 17-10. The Phils knock out the Bucs
ace Cooper, scoring 6 runs in 2 2/3 innings, but the Pirates score 8 in
the 4th to take the lead. Three Pirate pitchers are 5 for 5 at the plate,
including Whitey Glazner's homerun, and the only Buc batter to not contribute
two safeties is cleanup hitter Clyde Barnhart.

1923
The Giants beat the Reds, 6-2, to sweep the five game series with
Cincinnati. Collier's Eye, a sporting sheet, will allege that Reds players
Pat Duncan and Sammy Bohne had been approached by gamblers who offered
them $15,000 to lose the series. The players will be called before NL head
John Heydler, and later the two will sue the publication for slander before
settling out of court.

The Indians roll over the Washington Senators, 22-2. Down 13-1 in the
7th, the Nats bring in Squire Potter, but his only ML appearance is not
pretty. Potter walks the first 2 batters on 8 pitches, and finishes the
game allowing 9 runs on 11 hits in 2 innings, walks 4, and tosses a wild
pitch. The Indians mercifully get caught stealing 2B three times and have
another runner out at 3B trying to stretch a double. Potter's brother Dykes
will have a similar record in 1938 (as noted in Retrosheet). Today Indian
first baseman Frank Brower goes 6 for 6 with a double and five singles.

1925
In the top of the first at Philadelphia, Indians batter Pat McNulty is
injured at 1B when P Jack Quinn, covering the bag, spikes him (as noted
by Retrosheet). Connie Mack allows Luke Sewell as a courtesy runner,
though Sewell doesn't appear in the boxscore. A bandaged McNulty returns
to action but is replaced by a pinch hitter in the 8th. Cleveland wins,
10-4, then loses game 2 to Ed Rommel, 2-0.

1926
Boston Brave hurler Bob Smith stops the Pirates, 2-0, and teammate Johnny
Wertz matches him in the nitecap, winning 2-0.

Carl Mays coasts to his 3rd shutout in a row, an 11-0 Reds win over the
Giants at the Polo Grounds. Chuck Dressen hits a grand slam in the 3rd
inning, off Chuck Davies. The Giants come back in game 2 to win, 3-1.

1928
The Giants clip the first-place Cards, 10-1, behind Larry Benton's 18th
victory. Benton scatters 6 hits and holds St. Louis scoreless till the 9th,
while his teammates are lighting up Flint Rhem for 15 hits in 7 2/3 innings.

Detroit beats the red-hot A's, 4-1. Winning pitcher Owen Carroll triples
home the game-winner in the 7th inning.

1929
For the 2nd game in a row, Babe Ruth hits a grand slam homerun as the Yanks
roll to a 13-1 win over the A's in the lidlifter. Cochrane homers in his
one at-bat for the A's only run as the Yankees score 10 runs in the first
2 innings. George Pipgras is the winner. The A's take the nitecap, 4-2,
as George Earnshaw goes 8 innings for the win.

1932
At Boston, the Braves sweep a pair, 2-1 and 7-6, to extend the Pirates'
losing streak to 9 games. But the Braves lose LF Red Worthington for the
season when he breaks a leg sliding into 3B in the first inning of game
2. The Braves now move into 3rd place.

1934
The Cards' Dizzy Dean becomes the first pitcher to reach 20 wins this season
with a 2-0 shutout over the Reds.

1938
New York's Red Ruffing loses his no-hitter when Cleveland's Roy Weatherly
doubles in the 9th with one out. The Yankees and Ruffing win easily, 7-0.

1940
A crowd of 53,997, an NL record for a night game, watches the Dodgers beat
the Giants, 8-4, on Mel Ott Night at the Polo Grounds. Only Chicago and
Boston are without lights in the NL. New York's large turnout is due to it
being Mel Ott Night.

1941
The Cards retake 1st place over the idle Dodgers by edging the Reds, 3-2
in 11 innings. Mort Cooper retires the last 2 Reds with the bases loaded.

Bob Feller goes down in defeat for the 4th time in his last 5 starts as the
Tigers beat the Cleveland ace, 4-3, in 13 innings after Clarence Campbell's
3-run pinch homer ties it for the Tribe in the 9th after 2 pinch hitters
reach safely. The 3 pinch runners scoring ties the league and ML mark for
an inning. In a rare triple-double, Feller strikes out 13, walks 11 and
gives up 13 hits.

1943
The Giants strand 18 runners in a 9-6 loss to the Phillies. Mel Ott's team
leaves 2 runners on in every inning to symbolize their dreary season that
will result in 98 losses and the first Giant tail-end finish since 1915.

1948
Before 66,000 fans, New York's Vic Raschi (14-4) allows 4 singles in stopping
the Indians, 5-0. DiMaggio has a pair of doubles, drives in 3 runs, and
swipes home on the front end of a double steal.

1949
Lineup juggling is a Casey Stengel forte as his Yankees suffer injury after
injury as the Browns and Yankee pitchers throw at each other. Against the
Browns, 13 different Yankees score a run, tying a record, in the first game
of a doubleheader, as the Yanks roll to a 20-2 win. Berra hits a three-run
homer but on his next time at-bat he fractures his thumb when he is hit by
a pitch. He will be out until September. DiMaggio hits a three-run round
tripper as well. The second game ends in a 2-2 tie.

1951
The Phils shut out the Braves, 1-0 in 15 innings, in the 2nd game of

relief. The Phils capture the opener, 3-1, on Robin Roberts' 15th win.

In a day-night doubleheader the Dodgers sweep a pair from the Giants,
taking the first game, 7-2, behind the solid relief of Carl Erskine. Hodges,
Snider and Furillo homer. Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 6-5, in 10 innings
after jumping on Maglie for a 5-1 lead. Snider and Furillo homer again,
while Bobby Thomson goes deep for the Giants. Cox' RBI single wins it, giving
the Dodgers an 11 1/2 game margin, the biggest lead in Brooklyn history.

Senator Edwin C. Johnson backs the reserve clause in his testimony, citing
his bill to exempt baseball from antitrust legislation.

Bobby Doerr suffers a severe sacroiliac pain that forces the future Hall
of Famer into early retirement. The Red Sox regular 2B for 13 seasons,
Doerr will become a Red Sox coach.

1952
Umpire Bill McGowan is suspended for four days by the AL - his second
suspension in four years. In a game in St. Louis, McGowan throws out Tiger
P Billy Hoeft, who had been heckling him from the dugout. When St. Louis
writers, who had a stormy relationship over the years with the veteran
McGowan, ask him to identify the player, the umpire refuses, then adds an
obscene gesture. The writers' complaint results in a suspension.

1953
The Yankees turn back the 2nd place White Sox with a 6-1 win at the
Stadium. Mantle's line drive in the 3rd goes for a 3-run inside-the-park
homer, and Berra follows with one out of the park.

1955
After a 12-17 record in July, the Yankees are in a four-team race. The
2nd division Tigers beat New York, 4-2, in game one, and New York then
earns a critical 3-2 10th-inning win on a Mickey Mantle 2-out homer off
Babe Birrer. It is the Mick's 2nd homer of the game, having connected off
starter Frank Lary. The Yanks finish the day in a virtual tie with Chicago,
a 1/2 game ahead of Cleveland and 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston.

1956
The Boston Red Sox fine Ted Williams $5,000 for spitting at Boston fans, as
the Red Sox edge the Yanks, 2-1, in 11 innings on Williams' bases-loaded
walk. It is Williams' 3rd spitting incident in 3 weeks. The spitting
started after the crowd of 36,350, a record for night games at Fenway Park
and the biggest turnout since WW2, started booing the Splendid Splinter
for muffing Mickey Mantle's windblown fly in the 11th. Before the game, RF
Jackie Jensen had to be restrained by teammates from going into the stands
after a heckler. Last September, Jensen had challenged a fan to come out
of the stands.

A crowd of 51,713 at the Orange Bowl, the largest ever to attend a minor

picking up two victories. Staley will be 13-8, all in relief, with both

back into first place.

The 10th-place Mets send 1B Frank Thomas to the NL-leading Phils (1 1/2 games
ahead of the Giants) for P Gary Kroll, OF Wayne Graham and cash. Thomas,
seemingly the answer to the Phils' 1st base problem, rode the Mets' team
bus to Philadelphia, then found out he was traded. He then drives in 2 runs
as the Phils top the Mets, 9-4. The Phils will take the next two games with
Thomas collecting 5 RBIs in the sweep.

1966
Lee Bales gets off to a shaky ML start, striking out 4 times, as the Braves

wins the opener 3-0.

the major leagues, becomes the first 20-game winner in the major leagues
this season when he goes the distance blanking the White Sox, 1-0. The only
run of the game scores on balk committed by Joe Horlen in the sixth inning
of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum contest.

1972
When Cleon Jones misses a shoestring catch in the bottom of the 13th inning,

pitches 10 innings, is the winner. Mets 2B Ken Boswell has no chances to

Lankford has a 3-run homer in the 1st for St. Louis off Stevens, in relief
of Steve Trachsel who lasts just 1/3 of an inning.

Pete Harnisch pitches 6 innings of shutout ball, and Belinda and Williams
continue the whitewash as the Reds roll 17-0 over Milwaukee. Reggie Sanders
drives in 3 runs with 2 doubles and a homer. Sanders, Sean Casey and Aaron
Boone all hit bases loaded doubles in the 12-run 6th inning. Taubensee and
Barry Larkin also homer in the game.

The Angels obtain P Jeff Juden from the Brewers in exchange for a player
to be named.

1999
The Royals honor George Brett's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame
with an on-field ceremony prior to the game against Minnesota. The former
third baseman played his entire 21-year career in Kansas City compiling a
.305 lifetime batting average.

Just one day after Tony Gwynn reaches the historic milestone, Devil Rays
3B Wade Boggs also gets the 3000th hit of his career in Tampa Bay's 15-10
loss to Cleveland. Boggs goes 3 for 4 in the contest, reaching the 3000
mark with a 6th inning HR off Chris Haney, the first player to reach the
milestone with a homerun. Boggs rounds the bases pointing skyward blowing
a kiss in memory of his mom and gets down on his knees to kiss home plate.

The Braves infielders look inept when they let an infield pop-up drop
between them in the 9th inning of a 15-4 victory over the Giants. But SS
Ozzie Guillen turned the miscue into an unusual foul ball. The towering pop
by J.T. Snow falls on the pitcher's mound when second baseman Bret Boone
called off the other infielders, then can't reach the ball. Guillen lets
it bounce toward the third-base line. As soon as it is in foul territory,
he grabs the ball, turning it into a foul. Snow then flies out.

2000
The Yankees claim Jose Canseco off waivers from the Devil Rays. The
35-year-old slugger will appear in just 37 games for the Bronx Bombers,
primarily as a designated hitter, hitting .247 in 111 at-bats.

The Yankees obtain Jose Canseco from the Devil Rays. The move, which
mystifies even manager Joe Torre, is presumably designed to keep the high
priced slugger away from AL East rivals.

2001
Black Betsy, Shoeless Joe Jackson's 40-ounce warped hickory bat, is won by
30-year-old businessman Rob Mitchell in a 10-day eBay auction. The $577,610
price tag is believed to be the largest amount ever paid for a baseball bat.

The Braves defeat the Astros, 6-5, as Greg Maddux sets a NL record for
consecutive innings without a walk. Maddux hurls 6 innings in the game
to extend his streak to 70 1/3 frames without a free pass. The old mark
of 68 innings was held by Christy Mathewson in 1913 and Randy Jones in
1976. Maddux leaves the game with the streak intact and is 14 IP away from
the major league record, set by Bill Fischer in 1962.

At Wrigley Field, during the 7th inning stretch of the Cubs' 5-4 win over
the Rockies, former Chicago Bears player Steve McMichael (and currently
a pro wrestler) leads the crowd in the singing of Take Me Out to the Ball
Game. Prior to singing, however, McMichael, upset at a call that went against
the Cubs in the previous inning, tells the crowd, "Don't worry, I'll have
some speaks with that home plate umpire after the game." McMichael then boos
and blows a kiss toward the ump. Umpire Angel Hernandez throws McMichael
out of the game, as the umps fear his remarks could incite the crowd. The
Cubs win in the 9th when Ricky Gutierrez slides under a tag at home.

2002
Major leaguers agree to be checked randomly for illegal steroids starting
next year. The proposal, which addresses a major issue in the current contract
talks, ends the players' decades-old opposition to mandatory drug testing.

After piloting the club to a 45-45 record as the interim skipper, Clint
Hurdle is given a two-year contract extension by the Rockies. The club's
former hitting coach replaced Buddy Bell, who was fired April 26.

The Mariners upend the Blue Jays, 5-4, despite Toronto SS Chris Woodward's
3 HRs.

2003
Albert Pujols joins Jose Canseco as the only other player in major league
history to hit 30 homeruns and drive in 100 runs during their first three
seasons.

Fireballer Eric Gagne ties the single-season record for consecutive saves
to start a season established in 1995 by Jose Mesa of the Indians. The
Dodger closer strikes out the Reds' side in the ninth inning for his 38th
save this season and 46th consecutive regular-season save overall.

2004
At SBC Park, Greg Maddux leads the Cubs to an 8-4 victory over the Giants
for the 300th win of his career. He becomes the 22nd hurler to reach the
magic number.

The Angels beat the Royals, 7-5, as Troy Percival becomes the 6th pitcher
in history with 9 straight seasons of 20 or more saves.

The Mariners defeat the Devil Rays, 6-2. Seattle manager Bob Melvin is
ejected before the game begins for arguing with crew chief Joe West about
a controversial interference call in Friday night's game.

2005
In the battle of the Zambranos, the Mets' Victor is victorious when he
defeats Carlos and the Cubs at Shea Stadium, 6-1. In addition to sharing
the same last name, the two Venezuelan pitchers, who are not related, also
wear the same number (38), enter the game with same number of career wins
(41), play for teams which started the series with the same record (54-54),
as well being both switch hitters and throwing right-handed. It is the 4th
time in ML history that starting pitchers with the same last name face each
other, and the 2nd time that each had the same number of career wins going
into the contest.

On the main concourse in left field at U.S. Cellular Field, the White
Sox unveiled a life-sized bronze statue of Carlton Fisk. The Hall of Fame
catcher, who played for the ChiSox from 1981 to the end of his career in
1993, joins team founder Charles A. Comiskey and Cuban legend Minnie Minoso,
who are also honored with statues in the Chicago ballpark.

The Diamondbacks defeat the Rockies, 9-4. Craig Counsell leads the Arizona
attack with 5 hits.

Manny Ramirez is 4 for 4 with a HR and 3 RBIs to back Tim Wakefield in
the Red Sox' 11-7 victory over the Twins. Manny doubles in the 5-run 1st
inning when the Sox bat around against Joe Mays. Wakefield (11-9) goes 8
innings to join Cy Young and Roger Clemens as the only pitchers to pitch
2,000 innings in a Boston uniform.

David Eckstein hits a 9th-inning grand slam off Chris Reitsma to give the
Cardinals a 5-3 win over the Braves. Eckstein also hit a walkoff grand slam
as a member of the California Angels in 2002. The last time a Card hit a
game-winning grand slam was Tommy Herr on April 18, 1987.

Dontrelle Willis tosses a shutout in Cincinnati, winning 2-0, over the
Reds. Willis has yet to be scored on in 16 innings at the Great American
Ball Park. Both runs are unearned and come on three throwing errors in
the first 5 innings by Reds P Ramon Ortiz. Each one is a pickoff attempt
on Juan Pierre. When Ortiz walks Pierre in the 7th, a loud voice shouts,
"Don't throw to first base." It could have been Reds manager Jerry Narron
who said later, "I probably should have told him before the game only try
it if you can make a good throw."

The A's, down by 4 runs to the Mariners going into the bottom of the ninth
inning, score five runs in the bottom of the frame to win the game, 8-7. The
last time the A's scored 5 in the 9th to overcome a 4-run deficit was July
4, 1957, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. After Mark Kotsay and Eric
Chavez hit 2-run doubles, Steve Swisher walks with the bases loaded to
score the winner.

Mariners SS Mike Morse is suspended 10 days for violating ML baseball's
steroids policy. Morse admits to having taken steroids in 2003, but claims
to being clean since then.

Orioles 1B Rafael Palmeiro leaves the team, to rehabilitate his right ankle
and knee, and says he plans on returning before the season's over. No,
he doesn't.

2007
In front of a very supportive home crowd at AT&T Park, Barry Bonds surpasses
Hank Aaron as the all-time homerun leader when he connects on a 3-2 pitch
for #756 off southpaw Mike Bacsik of the Nationals. During the 10-minute
celebration following the historic homer, a surprise video message is
played on the scoreboard in which Hammerin' Hank congratulates the Giants'
left fielder for breaking the 33-year-old record.

2009
The first Yankees-Red Sox game to go beyond 14 innings without a run
being scored in the fabled rivalry between the American League clubs ends
dramatically when Alex Rodriguez blasts a two-run walk-off homer in the
15th. A-Rod's homerun, the first the third baseman has hit since July 19th,
ends the five-hour 33-minute marathon.

2010
James Shields ties a major league record for round-trippers allowed in one
game when he gives up six round-trippers in the Rays' 17-11 loss to Toronto
at the Rogers Centre. 'Big Fly James', in his four innings of work, yields
homers to Aaron Hill (2), Edwin Encarnacion, Adam Lind, Jose Bautista and
J.P. Arencibia. J.P. Arencibia becomes the 28th player to hit a homerun on
the first pitch he sees as a major leaguer. The Blue Jays' rookie catcher
will also hit a double, a single and another home run finishing the contest
just a triple shy of completing the cycle.

2014
The Mets freshman Jacob deGrom establishes a franchise mark for rookies when
he throws 67 1/3 innings, a span of 10 games, without allowing a homerun. The
26-year-old right-hander's streak ends when Ian Desmond takes him deep in
the second inning of the team's 5-3 loss to Washington at Nationals Park.

2016
The first triple play in Petco Park history takes place in the bottom of
the seventh inning when Jabari Blash, with runners on first and second,
hits a grounder to Phillies third baseman Maikel Franco, who steps on the
bag to begin 5-4-3 around-the-horn triple killing. The last triple play
Philadelphia pulled off was accomplished single-handedly by Eric Bruntlett,
who retired three Mets unassisted in a 2009 contest at Citi Field.

Ichiro Suzuki becomes the 30th major leaguer to collect 3,000 hits when
he legs out a seventh inning triple in the Marlins' 10-7 victory over the
Rockies at Coors Field. The 42-year-old center fielder joins Paul Molitor
as the only other player to reach the milestone with a three-bagger.

2016 	
"Of course I think I can play baseball. You always think you have one more
hit in you. That wasn't in the cards. That was the Yankees' decision and
I'm at peace with it." - Alex Rodriguez, announcing his retirement. At
a crowded news conference, Yankee 3B/DH Alex Rodriguez announces he will
play his final major league game against the Rays in the Bronx on August
12 before becoming a special adviser and instructor with the team. The
41-year-old A-Rod, currently hitting .204, will end his career with 696
homeruns, fourth on the all-time list, trailing only Barry Bonds (762),
Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).

2017
On his 26th birthday, Mike Trout collects his 1,000th career hit, a line
drive double into the left-field corner off Dylan Bundy in the Halos' 6-2
loss to the Orioles at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. The Millville Meteor becomes
the tenth American Leaguer to reach the milestone prior to his age-26 season.

2018
with his victory against the Seattle Mariners, Bartolo Colon of Texas
became the winningest Latin American-born pitcher in Major League history,
passing Nicaragua's Dennis Martínez
