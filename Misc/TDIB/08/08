1901
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Brooklyn split two. Brooklyn wins the
opener, 3-0, before losing the nitecap to Christy Mathewson, 4-1. Brooklyn
threatens in the 6th, putting two on with no outs, but Matty K's Cozy Dolan,
allows a single, then strikes out Tom Daly and Bill Dahlen to end the threat.

1903
An overhanging gallery atop the LF bleachers at Philadelphia's NL park
collapses at 5:40 p.m. during a doubleheader with Boston, killing 12 and
injuring 282 (one source puts the injured at 232). The second game is canceled
and Philadelphia's remaining home games are played at the AL's Columbia Park.

Before a crowd of 31,647, "Iron Man" Joe McGinnity pitches the 2nd of
3 doubleheaders he will win this month, beating Brooklyn 6-1 and 4-3.
He also is credited with a steal of home in the 2nd game while Brooklyn
was arguing a disputed call of Iron Joe at 3B. Brooklyn P Henry Schmidt is
so upset about the steal that he throws the ball out of the park, a toss
that gets him tossed from the game. On August 31, Iron Joe will beat the
Phillies twice. He has now done double work 5 times, including 2 losses
on each of the 2 occasions at Baltimore in 1901. The combination of his
434 innings pitched and 31 wins, with Mathewson's 366 IP and 30 wins,
will make them the century's most productive one-season duo.

Furious when an old black ball is put into play when Cleveland is at-bat in
the last of the 11th and his objections are ignored by umpire Tommy Connolly,
Blues manager Nap Lajoie hurls the ball over the grandstand, suffering the
loss of the game to Detroit by forfeit. Detroit was leading, 6-5.

1904
Mathewson wins his 2nd in 3 days, beating St. Louis in relief, 4-3. Matty
enters in the 9th, fans two of the three outs, and New York then tallies
a run off Charles McFarland to win.

In Cleveland, with the Blues ahead of New York, 7-1, in the 4th, Dave Fultz
and manager Griffith argue a strike call with umpire Silk O'Loughlin. When
they refuse to go the bench, Silk orders a policeman to escort them off the
field. Tomorrow, Silk will throw out pitcher Jack Powell and have the police
escort Jimmy Williams off the field. Griffith and Williams will receive
suspensions from the AL, and (according to The Year They Called Off the WS)
Highlander owner Frank Farrell vows O'Loughlin will not be allowed to enter
Hilltop Park. He will, however.

1905
Dave Brain, who hit 3 triples in a game in Pittsburgh for St. Louis on May
29th, repeats the performance for Pittsburgh against visiting Boston. The
Pirates win in 10 innings, 5-4, with Brain's triples coming in the first
9 innings. He is the only major league player to perform the feat twice in
one season. The two performances also ties the career ML record ... no one
else in the 20th century will have two three-triple games in his career.

In Chicago, the Cubs notch 6 hits and 3 runs off Dummy Taylor, but the
Giants still lead, 4-3, in the bottom of the 4th, when McGraw lifts the
pitcher for Christy Mathewson. Matty shuts out Chicago over the last 5+
innings, but the win goes to Taylor. By today's standards the win would go
to Mathewson, since Taylor did not last through the first 5 innings.

1906
NL President Harry Pulliam upholds the forfeit to the Cubs of yesterday's
Giants game stating:  "I uphold the action of the umpires absolutely, and
if I am not sustained by the NL Board of Directors I will not only resign
my position as President of the NL, but I will quit professional baseball
forever." Giants owner John Brush then allows Johnstone to officiate,
and the Cubs win, 3-2, behind Three Finger Brown and Ed Reulbach. At the
month's end, the Cubs will have a 15-game lead.

The White Sox edge the A's, beating Eddie Plank, 1-0, in 10
innings. Dougherty's hit in the 10th, just the 2nd allowed by Plank, drives
in Davis with the run. Roy Patterson is the winner.

1907
At Pittsburgh, the Giants sweep two from the Pirates, 4-3 and 7-0. Mathewson
wins the opener, with relief help from McGinnity, and Hooks Wiltse slams
the door in the nitecap. The Giants move ahead of Pittsburgh into 2nd place.

1909
In a 3-0 Giants win at St. Louis, outfielder Bill O'Hara swipes 2B, 3B and
home in the 8th inning.

1911
Bill Keen, 18, debuts with the Pirates at 1B (as noted by Retrosheet) and
injures himself in the 5th running from 1B to 3B. He's replaced by a pinch
runner, who breaks the 8-8 tie with the Phils, by scoring on a single. Keen
makes 6 more pinch-hit appearances this year, but never scores a major
league run.

1913
After four attempts, Minneapolis finally beats Indianapolis, 11-2. On April
25, the American Association minor league contest was stopped with the scored
tied 1-1 due to rain, replayed on June 15 the game ended at 6-6 after nine
innings because of darkness, and then on August 7 after 13 innings darkness
again halted the game with the score knotted at 2-2.

Earl Hamilton, in his last start of the year, pitches the Browns to a 6-4
win over the Yankees. Hamilton is 3-0 against New York in 1913, two of
them one-hitters.

The Yankees pick up 3B Fritz Maisel from Baltimore (IL) for $12,000 plus
3B Ezra Midkiff (.197) and OF Bert Daniels (.216). Daniels will return to
the majors next year with the Reds and improve his average by 3 points.

1914
At Boston, center fielder Tris Speaker pulls off his 2nd unassisted DP of
the year, this one coming against Detroit. Tiger runner Harry Heilmann is
doubled off 2nd in the fourth inning when a hit-and-run play becomes a line
drive to Speaker. Boston wins, 5-2. Speaker had another unassisted DP on April
21 against the A's. The two OF unassisted DPs in a season is a ML record.

1915
Phils OF Gavvy Cravath drives home a club-record-tying (Bransfield, 1910)
8 runs on 4 doubles as Philadelphia wins, 14-7, in Cincinnati. Two of
Gavvy's doubles come with the bases loaded, a ML record, and the only
time this century that someone has doubled with the sacks full twice in a
game. Alexander coasts home to the win.

Hank O'Day, who managed the Cubs in 1914, returns to umpiring.

1916
The Athletics set an AL record with their 19th loss in a row on the road
(20th overall), a 9-0 yawner to the Tigers. The streak began on July 25th,
making it a record for losses in 2 weeks.

1918
Brooklyn tops the Cubs again, beating Hippo Vaughn, 4-1, done in by two
wild heaves by 3B Eddie Pick. Zach Wheat, hit by a pitch once by Vaughn,
goes hitless to stop his consecutive game streak at 26. Rube Marquard,
despite leaving in the 5th with a strained back, is the winner. With the
Giants losing to the Reds, the Cubs stay 6 1/2 ahead.

It is announced that Ebbets Field will become a Government storehouse as
soon as the season is over on September 2nd. The Brooklyn team offered
the park as a much-needed storage facility for war supplies, and it is now
expected that other teams will follow suit. The New York Times states that
"the turning over of the baseball park means that the major leagues will not
attempt to play next season." Washington Park, the old Federal League park,
has already been converted to a government storehouse.

1919
Reserve outfielder Casey Stengel is traded to the Phils for Possum Whitted,
who will bat .389 for the Pirates in the last 35 games.

1920
Detroit's Howard Ehmke whitewashes the Yankees, 1-0, in just 1 hour 13
minutes, one of the shortest games in AL history (shortest 1-0 game) With
no outs and 2 on in the 5th inning, the Yanks fail to capitalize as Ping
Bodie falls for the hidden ball trick applied by 2B Ralph Young.

The Browns sweep a pair from Washington, winning 3-2 and 11-4. Jack Tobin
is 4 for 4 with a double and triple in game one, while in the 2nd game,
against Olaf Erickson, the Browns' George Sisler hits for the cycle and
drives in 6 runs.

As reported by Fred Stein and Nick Peters, actor John Slavin is found
badly beaten in John McGraw's New York apartment. Both Slavin and McGraw
deny that a fight took place, but prohibition agents will obtain a grand
jury injunction against the Giants manager charging him with violating
the Volstead Act "by unlawfully possessing a bottle of whiskey." The two
pugilists will settle out of court but the Lamb's Club, where the drinking
took place, will expel McGraw as a member. McGraw will later be acquitted
of the charge and the club will welcome him back. He will also be called
to testify in Chicago hearings investigating gambling and bribery among
players, including Hal Chase and Heinie Zimmerman.

1921
In his first at-bat, St. Louis Browns rookie Luke Stuart hits a homerun,
the first AL rookie to accomplish the feat. His 9th-inning blast, good
for 2 runs, comes off no less than Washington's Walter Johnson. Johnson,
leading 16-3 after his teammates score 7 runs in the 8th, cruises home with
a 16-5 win. Stuart, who appeared in one game on July 28 but did not bat,
will play one more game and then leave the majors with this HR as his only
hit. The next AL rookie to connect for a homer on his first at-bat will be
Earl Averill in 1929.

1922
Pittsburgh makes a ML-record 46 hits in a doubleheader against
Philadelphia. Pittsburgh sweeps, winning 19-8 and 7-3. With their 27 hits
in game one, and 22 the day before, a two-game ML record (49) is set. In
today's double pounding, the hitting stars are Reb Russell and Cotton Tierney,
each of whom collect 8 hits and each scores 5 runs in game 1.

The Red Sox collect 21 hits against Cleveland in a 15-6 win at
Fenway. Cleveland manager Tris Speaker retaliates by hitting two homers
over the RF wall.

Tom Zachary and the Senators beat the Browns' Dixie Davis, 3-1, cutting
the St. Louis lead in the AL to a game.

The Giants Shufflin' Phil Douglas is suspended and fined $100 by John
McGraw. (Douglas, an alcoholic, and McGraw did not enjoy the best of
relationships after McGraw forced Douglas to undergo a terrible treatment
for alcoholism.) Douglas writes a letter to St. Louis Cardinals OF Les Mann,
his former roommate at Chicago, offering to disappear if they make it worth
his while, lest he help McGraw win the pennant. Mann turns the letter over
to Branch Rickey, who relays it to Commissioner Landis. In Pittsburgh on
August 16, Douglas admits he wrote the letter, and Landis bars him from
baseball for life. Sadly, when Douglas sobered up he asked Mann to destroy
the letter, but Mann had already passed it on. Douglas was 11-4 at the time,
with the lowest ERA on the club (2.63).

1924
Ruth has a pair of homers - his 37th and 38th - plus a triple and 2 walks,
but it is not enough as the Yankees fall to Cleveland, 10-8. Bush and
Shawkey do the bleeding. George Myatt's 2-run homer is the difference in
the 3-run 9th. Myatt also has a single and double.

The Washington Potomacs of the Eastern Colored League connect for 14
consecutive hits in one inning against South Philadelphia of the Penn-Jersey
League.

At Philadelphia, Lee Meadows wins a pitching duel, 1-0, over Jimmy Ring
by hitting an 8th-inning homer over the LF wall. At 1 hour 12 minutes,
it is one of the fastest games of the year.

1925
The 2nd place Giants make two deals to help in the pennant race. Hack Wilson
goes to Toledo for Earl Webb, and Freddie Fitzsimmons is picked up from
Indianapolis for cash and two players to be named later. Fat Freddie will
be a fine addition, but Webb is soon back in the minors. Wilson, sent to
Toledo for seasoning, will be left unprotected by the Giants' front office,
and the Cubs will swipe the fireplug slugger.

1929
Rogers Hornsby cracks a 4th inning homer - one of his 4 hits - as Chicago
edges the Reds, 1-0, at Wrigley. Charlie Root allows 7 hits in beating
rookie Benny Frey.

1930
In St. Louis, the first place Dodgers beat the Cardinals, 11-5, and are now
12 games ahead of the 4th place Birds (53-52). The Cubs win to stay close
in 2nd place and the Giants sweep a pair to stay 5 1/2 games behind in
third place. But it will be the 4th-place Cardinals who will make the charge.

1931
Washington's Bobby Burke, a little-known lefthander, throws a 5-0 no-hitter
against Boston. Burke will finish the year 8 and 3, the best mark of his
10-year career. "Burke didn't throw more than a half dozen curves all
afternoon," said plate umpire George Moriarty.

1933
A series of Midsummer Classic games is proposed by William Veeck, president
of the Cubs. Although the idea receives some support, it will be 64 years
before a team from the American League plays a club from the National League
during the regular season.

1934
Wilbert Robinson dies in Atlanta. Beloved as "Uncle Robbie," the jovial
and bemused manager of the Dodgers for 18 seasons, his 7 for 7 day with
Baltimore still stands as a ML record.

1936
At the Olympics in Berlin, the announcement is made of the formation of
the World International Baseball Federation, a 16-nation group, including
Hawaii, to be headquartered in Miami.

1937
The White Sox stop Boston's winning streak of 12 games by pounding the
Bosox, 13-0, after losing the opener, 7-6. The Red Sox win with 2 runs in
the 9th. John Whitehead holds the Red Sox to 4 hits in game 2, while Zeke
Bonura provides a grand slam.

1940
At Fenway, 27-year-old Tiny Bonham makes his ML debut for the Yankees and
loses, 4-1, to Fritz Ostermueller. Tiny, brought up to replace the sore-armed
Lefty Gomez, will still end the season at 9-3, complete 10 games, and toss
three shutouts. His ERA will be 1.90 (Feller will lead with 2.61).

1941
In New York, Les Brown and his Orchestra record "Joltin' Joe," for Columbia
Records. The song about Yankee outfielder Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak
will be played incessantly on radio stations across the country eventually
reaching number 12 on the charts.

Cubs rookie Paul Erickson wins his first ML game, pitching a nifty one-hitter
to beat the Pirates' Johnny Lanning, 1-0. The Cubs collect 10 hits while
Bob Elliott's hit in the 7th is the lone Buc shot.

The White Sox roll over the Browns, 16-2. Taffy Wright paces the 15-hit
attack with 2 homers and a double to drive in 6 runs.

1942
A bean ball salvo between Manny Salvo of the Braves and Whit Wyatt of the
Dodgers ends in a 2-0 Boston victory. Only two batters are hit, but many
pitches are close and the hurlers almost come to blows twice. Salvo gets
fined $50 and Wyatt $75. Wyatt also tosses a bat. For Wyatt (8-1), it is
his first loss after 10 straight wins over the Braves.

1943
In Cleveland, the Browns lose 5-2. St. Louis takes the field 8 times without
recording an assist in the game, a ML record first in history. The Reds had
no assists in a 7-inning contest on July 22, 1907. The Yanks will have no
assists in a 9-inning game on July 4, 1945.

1945
The Tigers split a pair with the Red Sox, winning 5-2 before losing 7-4 in
12 innings. In the 10th frame of the 2nd game, a line drive off the bat
of Detroit's Hank Greenberg fractures the head of Boston Red Sox rookie
pitcher Jim Wilson, necessitating a 2-hour operation. Wilson will return
to pitch 11 more years, but won't win another ML game till 1951.

1946
Bill Benswanger, son-in-law of Barney Dreyfuss, owners of the Pittsburgh
Pirates since 1900, sell the club to a group headed by Frank McKinney and
John Galbreath. Singer Bing Crosby is among the investors in the team. The
Pirates are purchased for a reported $2.5 million.

A bloop single in the 7th inning by former battery mate Frank Hayes
deprives Bob Feller of a no-hitter against the White Sox. Hayes was traded
by Cleveland in June, just weeks after hitting a homer in Feller's April
30th no-hitter. It is the 8th one-hitter of Feller's career. His 10 games
of less than 2 hits betters Addie Joss' old mark of 9.

1947
Schoolboy Rowe of the Phillies pinch hits for Johnny Sain to become the first
major leaguer to appear in different All-Star games representing teams from
the National League and American League. In the 1936 Mid-summer classic,
the former Philadelphia A's ace threw three innings of relief against the
NL stars.

At Wrigley Field, Bill Nicholson breaks up a pitching duel between Johnny
Schmitz and Ewell Blackwell with an 11th-inning solo homer. The Cubs whip
the Reds, 2-1. Nicholson also scores the Cubs' first run, an unearned
tally. Chicago helps Schmitz out with a 7th-inning triple play when Len
Merullo snags a liner, steps on 2B and fires to Waitkus.

1948
In Cleveland, 73,484 fans watch the Indians and Yankees square off for 2
games. Trailing in the opener, an ailing Lou Boudreau hits a bases loaded
pinch single in the 7th to tie the game, and Satchel Paige wins it in relief,
8-6. Steve Gromek goes 7 innings in the nitecap to give the Indians a 2-1
win over rookie Bob Porterfield, making his ML debut. The Indians and the
A's are now tied for 1st (60-39), with the Yankees 2 games back and Red
Sox in 4th place, 2 1/2 out.

1949
After pinch hitting yesterday, Carl Furillo returns to the Dodgers'
lineup after an injury and has 2 hits and a run in a 2-1 win over the
Giants. Newcombe wins on a 3-hitter as Brooklyn stays tied with the
Cards. Furillo will hit .431 in the final 8 weeks of the season and finish
at .322, fourth best in the league.

1952
Bob Neighbors, a shortstop who played briefly with the 1939 Browns, is
missing in action in the Korean War. Neighbors is the only ex-major leaguer
killed in action in Korea and the 6th and last to die this century. There
will be no casualties of major leaguers in Vietnam.

1953
Yankee southpaws Whitey Ford and Bob Kuzava hurl 1-0 and 3-0 shutouts against
the White Sox. Kuzava gives up only Bob Boyd's double in the 9th. The Sox
now trail New York by 8 1/2 games.

1954
The Dodgers score an NL record 13 runs in the 8th off Cincinnati in Ebbets
Field to win 20-7. Twelve of the runs are unearned and a NL-record 12 are
tallied with two outs and no one on. Gil Hodges gets a triple and a HR in
3 at-bats in the inning, while Clem Labine, who has a career .100 BA, walks
twice. Jackie Robinson drives in 3 runs with a single as Snider scores from
1B. Campanella, Gilliam and Don Hoak all homer for Brooklyn in the game to
pin the loss on Karl Drews.

The Yankees spot the host Tigers a four-run lead, tie it up, then watch as
Detroit wins it, 10-8, in 10 innings. Mantle has one homer, off Billy Hoeft,
and just misses on a titanic opposite field drive that curves foul before
leaving the stadium.

1955
With his record at 18-1, the Dodgers' Don Newcombe loses a 1-0 game to the
Cubs' Sam Jones. Newk's two losses have both been to the Cubs.

1956
Mantle's opposite field homer, off Camilo Pascual, in the first inning jump
starts the Yankees to a 12-2 win over the Senators. Mantle is now 9 games
ahead of Ruth's 1927 pace.

Robin Roberts wins his 8th straight and his 4th win in 10 days, as the
visiting Phils defeat the Giants, 9-3. Ted Kazanski lines an inside-the-park
grand slam off Jim Hearn, just the 4th in club history, to pace the attack.

At Milwaukee, the Cards' Herm Wehmeier stages a one-man attack, hurling
a 4-hitter and driving in the winning run in the 10th to win, 3-2. He
singles off Burdette's glove. He also stops Hank Aaron's hitting streak of
25 straight games. The Braves win the lidlifter easily, 10-1, behind homers
by Logan, Crandall and 2 by Adcock.

1961
At Fenway, the Twins' Camilo Pascual gives up an inside-the-park grand slam
to Gary Geiger in the 3rd and a solo shot to Buddin in the 7th, but wins,
6-5. Pascual drives in his first 3 runs of the year to snap the Twins'
8-game losing streak.

1963
Vern Law (4-5) is placed on the retired list with a sore arm. He will come
back in 1964.

In the 5th inning, Frank Howard and Moose Skowron pinch-hit back-to-back HRs

lopsided shutout in twenty years. Jim Maloney coasts to the win, while Don
Drysdale takes the loss.

The Cubs trip the Braves, 4-0, behind Bill Hands, with relief help from
Phil Regan. Ump Chris Pelakoudas goes to the mound to inspect the cap and
glove of the Cubs' Phil Regan. When the game continues, Pelakoudas accuses
Regan of 3 illegal pitches nullifying a fly out, a K and changing a strike
to a ball. Wrigley fans toss garbage onto the field. Durocher, Hundley and
Al Spangler get tossed. NL prexy Giles after a special hearing, says umps
should have better evidence before calling pitches illegal.

1969
Hot-hitting Manny Sanguillen collects a single, double and triple to lead
the Pirates to a 7-1 win over the Padres. Sanguillen is 13 for his last
26. Bob Veale allows 11 hits but strikes out 10 for the win.

pair from the White Sox, 7-3 and 9-7. Tresh's homer comes in the 8th inning
of the Friday nitecap. Rookie of the year candidate Carlos May has 2 hits
in the 2nd game, his last before going on weekend Army reserve duty at
Camp Pendleton, California. While there, May suffers a serious injury when
a mortar misfires and blows off most of his right thumb. May, hitting .281
with 18 homers, will have extensive skin grafts and surgery and will return
to play 150 games and hit .285 next year. His HR output will drop to 12.

1970
On Old Timers Day at the Stadium, the Yankees retire Casey Stengel's uniform
#37. The "Old Perfessor's" Bronx Bombers won seven World Series during his
12-year tenure with the team from 1949 to 1960.

1972
After much speculation about the future of the team, the Yankees sign a
thirty-year lease to play in the 'new' Yankee Stadium beginning in 1976.
The City agrees to spend $24 million on renovations, but the actual costs will
approach $100 million. After completing the Stadium's 50th-Anniversary this
season, the Bronx Bombers will play their home games for the next two seasons
at Shea Stadium while the 'House that Ruth Built' is completely remodeled.

At Riverfront Stadium, the Reds beat the Dodgers, 2-1, in 19 innings. The
Dodgers use 5 pitchers and the first 4 (John, Brewer, Richert and Perranoski)
strike out 22 batters to tie a NL record. The 5th, Pete Mikkelson, fans
no one in the defeat to Pedro Borbon. Joe Hague's single drives in pinch
runner Ted Uhlaender to end the marathon.

1973
At Kauffman Stadium, Red Sox DH Orlando Cepeda collects four doubles
(tieing a ML record) in the team's 9-4 win over the Royals. Luis Tiant is
the winning pitcher. 'Cha Cha', who signed with Boston in January, was the
first player since the inception of the new position to be added to a roster
specifically as its designated hitter.

Against Texas, Yankee starter Fritz Peterson injures himself fielding a bunt
single by leadoff hitter Dave Nelson and he is replaced by Fred Beane. Beane
pitches 9 innings, allowing 4 hits and winning, 3-2, on Gene Michaels 2-out

1974
The Royals-Twins game is briefly interrupted by President Nixon's resignation
speech. The speech is broadcast after it begins and the next inning is
delayed until the conclusion of the speech. The Twins prevail over the
host Royals, 3-2, in 14 innings when Tony Oliva's sac fly drives home Rod
Carew. Bill Campbell pitches 7 innings of relief for the win.

1976
In the first game of a doubleheader against Kansas City at Comiskey Park,
the White Sox take the field wearing shorts - the idea of maverick owner
Bill Veeck. Chicago, after a 5-2 comfortable win in the opener, don long
pants for the nightcap and come out on the short end to the Royals, 7-1.

Padres rookie Butch Metzger is credited with a 4-3 victory over the
Astros, his 10th win without a defeat. With a victory in each of the past
2 seasons, Metzger's mark of 12-0 to start a career matches Hooks Wiltse,
in 1904. Metzger will lose his last 4 decisions this year.

1979
Oakland's Matt Keough loses to California, 8-1, running his season record
to 0-14, and tying a dubious ML record. His 14 straight loses ties him for
the 4th spot in the AL.

Braves, 3-1.

1982
In the 9-5 Angels victory over the Mariners at the Kingdome, Doug DeCinces

Minnesota six days ago.

1984
The Cubs tighten their grip on first place in the NL East with a 7-6 win over
the Mets at Wrigley Field, completing a 4-game series sweep. Keith Moreland
leads the way with 3 hits and 4 RBIs. Hubie Brooks is 4 for 4 with 4 runs
for New York. Davey Johnson gets tossed in the 7th after Bob Dernier gets

Jim Frey follows Johnson in the 9th when Smith throws behind George Foster.

Veteran P Don Sutton ends Milwaukee's 10-game losing streak with a 3-2 win
over the Royals. Sutton also passed the 100 strikeout mark for the 19th
straight season, a ML record.

1985
