1902
In Ft. Wayne, Indiana, a Sunday crowd of 3,500 watch a matchup of Cleveland's
Addie Joss and Boston's Cy Young. Boston pushes over 2 runs in the 11th to
win, 3-1.

1903
Joe McGinnity wins his 3rd doubleheader this month, stopping the Phils twice,
4-1 and 9-2, and handing losses to Chick Fraser and Bill Duggleby. Iron
Joe strikes out 9 batters in the opener to win. The two games total 3 hours
3 minutes.

1904
In a rowdy 3-2 11-inning Giants win in Cincinnati, ump Charley Zimmer
tosses McGann and Dahlen for arguing a safe call for the Reds. The high
point comes in the 6th when New York catcher Frank Bowerman slugs a fan,
a music teacher named Albert Hartzell, who has been heckling him. Police
escort the catcher from the field. Bowerman will be released from custody
tomorrow when the fan drops the charges. The Giants win the 2nd game as well,
4-1, in 7 innings, with the game shortened to allow the Giants to catch a
train for New York. The Giants leave Cincinnati with a 15-game lead over
Chicago in the NL.

1905
White Sox ace Frank Smith throws a near-perfect game, beating the Washington
Senators, 2-0. Jake Stahl's single accounts for the only Nat baserunner.

1906
Beset by injuries, the Tigers call 46-year-old Sam Thompson out of
retirement. He plays RF and bats cleanup driving in 2 runs in a 5-1 win
over the Browns. Thompson, who last played in the majors in 1898, appears
in 8 games and bats .226. When the regular umpires fail to appear, players
Wild Bill Donovan and Barney Pelty do the umping. Donovan umped once before,
in 1902.

In the great tradition of his late brother Ed, Frank Delahanty of New
York hits two HRs, a triple and a single, and knocks in 7 runs in a 20-5
rout of Washington. George Moriarty adds 2 triples as 8 players score 2 or
more runs. The game is called after 6 innings because of darkness and the
mercy rule. New York takes the opener as well, 7-5, behind the pitching of
Jack Chesbro.

1908
The Pirates and Cubs both win by shutouts, Chicago beating St. Louis, 2-0,
for its 10th straight win, and the Pirates whitewashing the Reds, 5-0. The
Giants are traveling today.

1909
The A. J. Reach Company is granted a patent for its cork-centered baseball,
which will replace the hard rubber-cored one. This change will be particularly
apparent in the NL in 1910-11. Less than three months ago, Shibe was granted
a patent for his version of a cork-centered ball.

1912
The Red Sox run their record to 87-37 with a 2-1 win over the A's. Following
the game, Connie Mack says he never realized how strong the Sox were,
and concedes the pennant to them. There are 30 games left for Boston.

1914
Walter Johnson relieves in the 8th inning with his Senators holding a 3-2
lead over the White Sox. On the first pitch, Jack Fournier hits a HR to tie
the game. Fournier's next at-bat comes in the 10th and he homers again to
give the Sox a 4-3 win. This is the first time Johnson has been reached
for 2 HRs in a game by the same batter (Gehrig will match it August 13,
1926). Last night the Sox beat Johnson, 2-1, and Fournier was 3 for 3 with
2 triples against the "Big Train."

1915
In the first game of a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, only 2 runners
reach base as Cubs right-hander Jimmy Lavender no-hits the hometown Giants,
2-0. This is Lavender's only shutout in his 11-16 season. Next season,
the 31-year-old knuckleballer will stymie New York once again tossing a
one-hitter, allowing only an infield safety to Benny Kauff.

Art Nehf and Tom Hughes are both 2-0 winners as the Braves sweep two from
the Reds.

1916
At Boston, the Browns' Ernie Koob beats the Red Sox and Babe Ruth, 2-1. Ruth
makes 2 hits and scores the lone Sox run but pops out to end the game.

1917
At Fenway, Babe Ruth wins his 20th, beating the A's, 5-3. Ruth gives up 6
hits and walks 5.

1918
The Red Sox clinch the pennant, winning the first of a twin bill from the
A's, 6-1. Ruth wins his 9th game in his last 11 starts, beating rookie Mule
Watson. Despite giving up 12 hits in the opener, Watson pitches a complete
game in the nightcap and gives up just one hit to win, 1-0. This is the
2nd doubleheader Watson has pitched this year.

The second-place Indians win, 2-1, over the White Sox, but are officially
eliminated from the AL race. Owner Jim Dunn then announces that the team will
not go to St. Louis for its final game, a doubleheader with the Browns, but
will disband for the year. On September 2, the Browns field a team and Browns
pitchers, Rogers and Leifield, tosses 10 pitches, 5 for each game. St. Louis
then claims a doubleheader victory, which goes into the standings.

1919
The Giants top the Robins, 4-3, with the help of Bill Klem who thumbs out
the entire Brooklyn bench except for manager Robinson and the batboy. Adding
injury to insult, Brooklyn P Burleigh Grimes is spiked covering 1B and will
miss the rest of the campaign.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

Cleveland's Stanley Coveleski allows 6 hits in beating Chicago,
6-1. Cleveland's Ray Chapman ties a ML mark with 4 sac bunts his first 4
times at-bat.

1920
In Chicago, the Phils beat the Cubs, 3-0, as Lee Meadows tops Pete
Alexander. This game later draws some suspicion because of heavy betting
reportedly placed on the outcome, which shifted the odds from the Cubs to
the Phils. Bill Veeck pulls his scheduled pitcher Claude Hendrix for Alex,
who is above suspicion, and offers the ace $500 if he wins. Hendrix, who
made 23 starts this year, makes none the rest of the campaign and will be
released after the season.

1921
In the Reds' 7-3 win over the Braves, the two infields accept 28 chances,
tying the ML record.

1923
Giants owner Charles Stoneham is indicted by a federal grand jury for
perjury. He will also be indicted for mail fraud. He had denied any
ownership in 2 bucket-shop operations that had been found guilty of stock
frauds. Creditors of the 2 firms claimed he retained financial interests
in both. Other NL owners are rumored to be forming a pool to buy him out,
but Stoneham stays out of jail and in the NL.

1926
Bill Sherdel and Allen Sothoron pitch the Cards back into first place with
6-1 and 2-1 wins over the Pirates. It is the first time a Cardinal team
has been in first place at the start of September.

White Sox IF Ray Morehart gets 9 hits in 10 at-bats in a doubleheader split
with Detroit, a ML record that has been matched but never broken. The Sox
coast to a 19-2 blowout behind Red Faber in game 1, then lose, 7-6, in game 2.

1927
The Yankees open a home stand by beating the Red Sox, 10-3. Ruth hits No. 43
and leads Gehrig by 2. With an 89-37 record, they now lead the 2nd-place
A's by 17.

1930
Bill Hallahan, on the way to becoming the NL strikeout leader, fans 12 as
the Cards beat the Cubs, 8-3.

With a chance to pick up a game and a half on the leading Cubs, the Giants
edge the Braves, 4-3, in the opener of a doubleheader before 40,000 fans at
the Polo Grounds. In the 2nd game, Mel Ott hits a double and 3 consecutive
HRs to drive in 6 runs, but the Braves counter with a homer by George Sisler
and two by slugging rookie Wally Berger among their 18 hits. Ott is the 4th
major leaguer to hit 3 straight homers, joining Goose Goslin (August 19,
1930), Carl Reynolds (July 2, 1930), George Kelly (September 17, 1923)
and Cap Anson (August 6, 1884). The final score is Boston 14, New York, 10.

At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers also roll up a football-like score when they
tally 23 hits, including round trippers by Babe Herman, Glenn Wright and
Rube Bressler, to stomp the Phils 14-3.

1931
Wes Ferrell of Cleveland hits 2 HRs, as he beats the White Sox, 13-5, at
Chicago. He will end his career with a record 37 HRs as a hurler, plus one
as a pinch hitter.

Against the Senators' Lloyd Brown, Lou Gehrig belts his 2nd grand slam
homer in three days, but the Senators hang onto 2nd place by beating the
Yankees, 6-5.

1932
Detroit P Chief Hogsett hits 2 HRs, as the visiting Tigers end Tony Freitas'
winning streak at 10 straight with a 5-4 victory over the A's.

Again, Kiki Cuyler leads the way for the Cubs. His 4th hit of the game ties
the score at 5-5 in the 9th inning. But the Giants score 4 in the 10th to go
up, 9-5. Chicago tally two runs and has 2 men on with 2 out when Cuyler bats
again. Cuyler's 5th hit of the game is a shot into the CF bleachers to give
the Cubs the 10-9 win, their 12th straight. Making this rain-soaked game
particularly noteworthy is the complicated substitutions by Cubs manager
Grimm in the late innings, which results in Zack Taylor hitting after he
has been substituted for. The Giants fail to protest and the result is
differing boxscores in the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.

1933
The Giants lose 3B Johnny Vergez for the season due to an appendectomy. Travis
Jackson, who has been filling in at SS, shifts to 3B. The Braves beat the
Giants today, 7-3.

1935
28-year-old Vern Kennedy pitches the first AL no-hitter since 1931 (the
sixth rookie no-hitter), and the first ever in Comiskey Park, blanking
Cleveland 5-0. He also is the batting star with a bases-loaded triple in
the 6th. Kennedy strikes out five, including the last batter in the 9th,
Joe Vosmik, the league's leading hitter.

1936
Yankees manager Joe McCarthy consents to Dixie Walker as a temporary
substitute while the White Sox patch up Mike Kreevich, who is spiked
on a play. Walker runs for Kreevich but does not replace him in the
outfield. Recently acquired Bob Seeds poles 2 homers, and DiMaggio adds
another, as the Yanks win, 5-1. Johnny Broaca wins his 11th, scattering
4 hits.

1937
Detroit's rookie Rudy York sets a new record for HRs in a month, hitting
his 17th and 18th to eclipse Babe Ruth's mark set in September of 1927. He
adds two singles in driving in 7 runs against Pete Appleton, as Detroit
beats Washington, 12-3. Roxie Lawson wins his 17th. York ends up with 44
RBIs for the month.

1939
The Reds purchase vet Al Simmons from the Boston Bees.

1941
White Sox starter Ted Lyons is lifted against the Browns in St. Louis after
7 innings and 15 hits. It is his last incomplete game in the majors. He will
finish 3 more in 1941, all 20 in 1942, and after serving in the Armed Forces,
completes all 5 starts in 1946. The Browns win, 12-8, then take the nitecap,
5-4, when Walt Judnich hits a bases-loaded triple in the 9th.

1942
Larry MacPhail seeks insurance for the Dodger pennant run by buying Bobo
Newsom from the Senators for $25,000. The purchase had been rumored for
weeks. The veteran will respond by shutting out Cincinnati, 2-0, in three
days. [Blanking the Reds is not difficult. Bill McKechnie's team will hit
.231 for the season, the lowest in the ML since the Highlanders hit .229
in 1914 and Brooklyn .229 in 1910.]

Mel Parnell, pitching for Canton (Middle Atlantic League) pitches 18 innings
against Zanesville, winning 5-4. He almost wins his own game in the 17th
after singling and going to 2B on a bunt. The next batter singles but Parnell
is thrown out at the plate. Parnell finishes the season at 16-9 for Canton.

1943
Bobo Newsom goes from the Browns to the Senators, his 3rd team in two months.

1945
The Senators again muff a chance to go into first place, dropping a pair
to the Yankees, 3-2 and 3-1. In between games, Nats pitcher Bert Shepard
receives the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in WW2. Shepard
lost his leg in battle.

1946
Luke Sewell quits as manager of the Browns. Zack Taylor will finish the
season.

Buddy Kerr hits into three DPs against the Dodgers, but his homer is the
difference as the Giants win, 2-1. Lefty Monte Williams is the winner over
Kirby Higbe. The high point of the game is at 2B when former Dodger Goody
Rosen slides into Eddie Stanky with spikes high. Stanky retaliates with a
hard tag in the face and the two start punching. Both are ejected. Extra
police are ordered for tomorrow's doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, a sweep
by the Dodgers that puts them into a tie for first place with St. Louis.

The rampaging Red Sox (92-40) sweep a pair from the Yankees, winning 5-2
and 3-1 at the Stadium. Boo Ferris (24-4) wins the opener and Mickey Harris
(16-7) takes the nitecap.

1947
Despite a 10-4 loss to the first-place Dodgers, the Giants' Jack Lohrke
homers to set a season record for HRs by a club. The Giants have now hit
183 homeruns, topping the 182 hit by the 1936 Yankees. They will end the
season with 221 round trippers.

The Cubs overcome Ralph Kiner's 39th homer of the season to defeat the
Pirates, 6-3, in Chicago. Doyle Lade goes the distance. Kiner's homer,
with one aboard, gives him 101 RBIs for the year.

1948
Before 45,531 at Wrigley Field, the last place Cubs beat the first-place
Dodgers, 3-0 and 7-2. Hank Borowy stops Brooklyn on one hit in the opener -
a single by Gene Hermanski - and faces just 27 batters. He hurls 100 pitches,
while Bob Scheffing drives in all 3 runs. Doyle Lade wins the nitecap. The
loss slices Brooklyn's lead to 2 percentage points over the Braves, 3-1
winners at Cincinnati, while the Cards and Pirates move just 2 games back.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks score 4 runs in the 8th but the Browns come
back with 5 in the 9th off Joe Page to make it close. But New York prevails,
10-9. 1B Henrich has a HR and an unassisted DP to help Allie Reynolds to
the win. The Yanks remain a game behind the Red Sox.

The Red Sox keep their precarious hold on 1st place with an 8-4 win over the
Tigers. Mel Parnell is the complete game winner. Ted Williams has 2 hits,
scores 2 runs and steals a base.

1949
In the opener of a day-nite split with the A's, the Indians win, 7-6, in
14 innings. Tribe 2B Joe Gordon participates in 6 double plays, while P
Al Benton gives up just 4 hits in the last 8 1/3 innings. Lou Brissie wins
his 13th, 2-1, in the nitecap.

1950
In front of 14,226 fans at Ebbets Field, Gil Hodges of the Brooklyn Dodgers
hits 4 HRs and a single, driving in 9 runs in the Dodgers' 19-3 rout of the
Boston Braves. Hodges becomes the fourth major leaguer in the century to
hit four homeruns in one game. Hodges' 17 total bases is the most since
1894. Gil's first homer is a 2-run shot off loser Warren Spahn in the
2nd inning, then a 3-run homer in the 3rd off Norman Roy, another 2-run
homer off Bob Hall in the 6th, and a 2-run shot off Johnny Antonelli in
the 8th. Carl Furillo is on base for each of the homeruns. Erskine is the
winner of the rout. Hodges had 4 long hits on June 25 last year, the first
Dodger to twice have 4 extra base hits in a game.

1952
Cleveland beats Billy Pierce (10-13) and the White Sox, 6-3, to remain 2
games behind the Yankees in the AL.

At Boston, the Braves top the Phillies' Steve Ridzik, 1-0, on a freak hit in
the bottom of the 9th. With the bases loaded, pitcher Virgil Jester ducks away
from an inside pitch and the ball hits his bat and bounds for a single. The
Phillies win the second game, 3-0, on Jim Konstanty's three-hitter.

At Chicago the Cubs outhit the Reds in both games, but only gain a split. Paul
Minner wins the opener, 4-2, and the Reds rebound for a 6-5 victory. The
Cubs have 12 hits in the loss, their 8th straight game with 10 hits or more.

The Montreal Royals clinch the International League pennant behind the
stellar pitching of lefty Tom Lasorda in game 2. The Royals take a pair
from Baltimore, 6-5 and 8-4.

Former player Arky Vaughan, 40, and a friend drown when their boat overturns
in a "bottomless" lake in California.

1954
Closing in on the professional homerun record of 69, established by Joe
Hauser (Minneapolis - 1938) and equaled by Bob Crues (Amarillo - 1948), Joe
Bauman blasts four homeruns in the Roswell Rockets' 15-9 victory over the
Wichita Falls/Sweetwater Spudders to bring his total to 68. The 32-year-old
slugging first baseman will finish the season with 72 homers, a record
which will last until Barry Bonds surpasses the mark by one round-tripper
in 2001. (This entry was inspired by Ron Skrabacz, who was born on this
date. His dad was a teammate of Joe's in 1949 on the Elk City Elks.)

The Indians beat the Yanks, 6-1, to record their 26th win of the month,
tying the 1931 A's for most wins in a month.

1955
Lefty Bill Wight of the Orioles gives up 5 runs in the first without
recording an out before being relieved by Hector "Skinny" Brown. Brown
then no-hits the Indian for 8 innings, striking out 10, but the O's lose,
5-1. Herb Score fans 13 in winning.

At KC, the Yanks beat up on Arnie Portocarrero and win, 11-6. Mantle has
a homer in the nite game.

1956
President Dwight D. Eisenhower is in attendance as Jim Lemon of the
Senators slugs 3 consecutive HRs, off Whitey Ford, in a night game against
the Yankees. But New York still wins, 6-4. Mantle has a homer, off Camilo
Pascual, for the Yanks.

1957
At Memorial Stadium, the Orioles top the Red Sox, 4-1, behind Gus Triandos'
inside-the-park homer, the only one of his career. Triandos lines an apparent
single over 3B in the 5th inning, and when the ball caroms off the wall
past Ted Williams, Gus lumbers around to score the first run of the game.

Steve Dalkowski, legendary minor league fastballer pitching for Kingsport
(Appalachian League), strikes out 24, walks 18, hits 4 batters, and throws
6 wild pitches in a row. He loses, 9-8, to the Bluefield Dodgers.

1959
Sandy Koufax breaks Dizzy Dean's NL mark and ties Bob Feller's (1938 4-1
loss to the Tigers) ML record of 18 strikeouts in a game against the Giants
as 82,974 fans watch. He also totals 31 Ks for 2 consecutive games to set
a new ML mark. Wally Moon's 3-run 9th-inning HR wins it, 5-2, for the Dodgers.

1962
The Indians' Dick Donovan (18-7) hits a pair of homers to pace the Tribe
to a 9-6 win over the Orioles. Both homers come off losing pitcher Robin
Roberts. Donovan had another two-homer game on May 18 to account for this
year's total.

1963
In the bottom of the ninth with two outs at Wrigley Field, Ellis Burton
hits a walk-off grand slam off Houston hurler Hal Woodeshick giving the
Cubs a dramatic 6-5 victory. Chicago had been trailing, 5-2, before the
switch-hitting center fielder hit the most memorable of his 17 career
round-trippers.

1964
Ground is broken for Anaheim Stadium, future home of next year's California
Angels.

Yankees 2B Bobby Richardson, 31, announces his retirement.

1967
Before a crowd of 4,992 at Wrigley Field, rookies Tom Seaver and Rich Nye
battle for 10 innings to a 1-1 tie. In the bottom of the 11th, the Cubs put
2 aboard with no outs and Ted Savage attempts to bunt. With the count 1-2,
Durocher lifts Savage for Al Spangler, who slaps a single to give the Cubs
a 2-1 win over the Mets. Pinch runner Fergie Jenkins scores the run.

1968
Steve Blass gets the first out against the Braves, and then moves to LF
as Roy Face relieves. Face retires Felix Millan and ties Walter Johnson's
ML record of 802 pitching appearances with one club. Blass comes back to
pitch and the Pirates go on to win, 8-0. Blass will not get credit for the
shutout but will still lead the NL in shutouts with 7. Late in the game,
the Pirates announce the sale of Elroy Face to the Detroit Tigers.

It is a tough month for Mets P Jim McAndrew as he takes his NL-tying 5th
shutout loss. Steve Carlton wins for the Cards, 2-0. McAndrew gave up just 6
runs in the 4 losses, losing 2-0 to Bob Gibson on July 21, and to the Dodgers
and Mike Kekich, 2-0 on August 4. On August 10th and 17th, he narrowed the
margin to 1-0 losses, to the Giants and Houston respectively. The 4 losses
are McAndrew's first ML decisions.

Baltimore's Dave McNally wins his 10th straight, topping the first-place
Tigers, 5-1. Paul Blair homers and triples in the win.

1969
Morganna, a well-endowed fan dressed in a mini dress, jumps onto the Atlanta

In their 2nd trade with Seattle within a week, Houston acquires OF Tommy
Davis for outfielders Sandy Valdespino and Danny Walton.

1971
The A's trade Frank Fernandez and Adrian Garrett to the Cubs for Bill

lifetime walks than hits (164/145).

1972
Another insurance purchase for the Tigers ... they buy slugging 1B/OF Frank
Howard from Texas.

1974

victory over the Tri-Cities Ports, their Northwest League opponents.

Johnny Bench drives in 7 runs with a bases-loaded double and grand slam to
lead the Reds to a 10-3 win over Montreal.

1980
In Cleveland, reliever Ed Farmer picks up two saves as the White Sox sweep
a doubleheader from the Indians. Chicago rallies for 8 runs in the last

scoring 4 in the last 2 innings to win, 8-7.

1981
Royals manager Jim Frey is fired and replaced by Dick Howser, whose Yankees
lost to Frey's Royals in last season's AL Championship Series. Kansas City
was 10-10 in the 2nd half of the season, 30-40 overall.

1982
The Mets lose their 15th in a row, 4-0, on Nolan Ryan's 2-hitter. The Mets
will finally win the following day, beating the Astros, 5-1.

1984
Trailing by five runs in the bottom of the ninth, the Rangers score six times
to beat the Brewers, 7-6. With two runs in and two out, Milwaukee shortstop

key role in the Cubs' title run, while of the three new Pad people, only
Jackson will perform decently.

1990
Refusing to part with Triple-A third baseman Scott Cooper to get Larry
Andersen from the Astros for the stretch run, Red Sox general manager Lou
Gorman trades the Eastern League's MVP Jeff Bagwell for the right-handed
relief pitcher. The University of Hartford standout will go on to win the
National League Rookie of the Year Award (1991) and will become the league's
MVP the same year Andersen retires from the Phillies (1994).

Ken Griffeys - Jr (20 years old) in CF and Sr (40 years old) in LF - become
the first father-and-son combination in ML history to play as teammates,

Maglie has done it more often.

1993
3B Gary Gaetti of the Royals hits the 239th HR of his career in KC's 6-5
win over Milwaukee. By doing so, he becomes the all-time HR leader for
players who homered in their 1st big league at-bat, moving past Hall of

ever to hit a slam in his 1st AB, doing so for the Phillies in 1898. Albert

provide post-season leadership and experience.

starts for the Dodgers, before signing as a free agent with San Diego.

Neftali Feliz' record saves established last season with the Rangers.

a player to be named and cash considerations. The 33-year-old outfielder,

the Pirates.

with 460 career homers, can provide some offensive punch for the contending
team, which recently has been slumping.
