In the Federal League, Newark takes 2 from Pittsburgh, winning, 2-1 and 3-1,
both wins coming on 10th inning inside-the-park homers by Edd Roush. Newark
leads by one percentage point over Kansas City, with Pittsburgh 3rd and
Chicago 4th, only 1 1/2 games separating the teams. The race is so close by
season's end Newark will be 5th, six games out. Chicago will win it by one
game with an 86-66 record to St. Louis' 87-67 and Pittsburgh's 86-67. There

Roush continues his hot hitting against the Phils, going 4 for 5 with a
triple and a homer, to lead the Reds to a 9-6 win. Heinie Groh adds 3 hits
while winning pitcher Pete Schneider has 2 hits and 2 runs. For the Phils,
1B Fred Luderus has 7 assists, a NL record that will last till June of 1971.

bases-loaded walk in the 9th that brings home John Brock with the winning
run. St. Louis wins, 4-3. Brooklyn comes back to take the nitecap, 5-2,
using shoddy St. Louis fielding to beat Lee Meadows.

At Washington, 3B Eddie Foster is 4 for 4 in the Senators' 7-1 victory

pitches in the 12th inning. Sloppy is the 2nd AL hurler to pitch a perfect
inning and the only ML hurler in history to do it in extra innings. But
great pitching by Eddie Rommel allows the A's to win it in 13 innings, 3-2.

1924
For the second time this year, a triple and steal of home helps decide an
extra inning game. At Yankee Stadium, Detroit's Frank O'Rourke triples in
the 12th and then steals home to help beat the Yankees, 8-6.

1925
After a disastrous western trip, the Giants trail the Pirates by 3 as the

a court injunction preventing police from interfering, they play the first
Sunday game ever seen in Philadelphia. A light rain holds the crowd to
10,000, but Lefty Grove sets down the White Sox, 3-2, without incident. A
court later rules Sunday baseball still illegal; it will be 1934 before
that law changes in Philadelphia.

The Reds sweep a pair in extra innings with the Braves, winning 4-3 in 10
innings and 7-6 in 12 innings. Dick Burns, Boston 1B, drops an easy fly

liner. Sewell has 4 of the 19 hits.

the 2nd game, Heilmann and Marty McManus hit 4th-inning homers off Walter
Johnson, the last homers the Big Train gives up in his career, and the only
time he's allowed 2 in an inning. It is also Johnson's last career loss. The

battle for 2nd place, with the Yanks in front by 12 1/2 games. Heilmann is
now hitting .390.

The Braves win their 3rd straight from the Cubs, 5-2, to cut Chicago's lead
over the Pirates to 2 1/2 games. By playing one inning in LF, Boston's Eddie

(1916-19). Steve Brodie had 574 in 1893-97.

Hadley, who wins 2-0. Ossie Bluege drives home both runs with a first-inning
single.

of the game.

1934
P Wes Ferrell hits an 8th inning HR to tie the game and a 2-out game-ending
homer in the 10th for 3-2 Red Sox win over the White Sox. It is the 2nd

1936
As part of league-wide celebration of the National League's 60th anniversary,

as U.S. Grant, Buffalo Bill, and the Sultan of Turkey, who attended a game
in Chicago. In attendance today are Judge Landis and league presidents
Ford Frick and Will Harridge. Three Finger Brown makes a few remarks and

'old timers.' Larry French then shuts out the current Reds, 7-0.

Washington ties an AL record when Red Kress, Joe Kuhel and Carl Reynolds
hit HRs in the 4th inning off the A's Gordon Rhodes. Rhodes takes the loss,

do with him." The Yanks lead Boston by 2 1/2 games.

behind to top the Reds, 4-3. Irvin homers in the 2nd off Ewell Blackwell,
but it is Whitey Lockman's double in the 8th that wins it for reliever
Sheldon Jones.

Tommy Byrne keeps walking them and the Red Sox keep stranding them as
St. Louis and Boston battle for 13 innings before the Sox win, 3-1. Making
248 pitches, Brownie Byrne walks 16 Sox batters, tying the AL walk record set
by Bruno Haas in 1915 (Haas walked 16 in a loss to the Yanks, his only ML
decision) and setting the ML mark for an extra-inning game. Boston strands
22 runners ... the AL record for stranded runners is 24, set by the Indians
in 18 innings on July 10, 1932. Byrne breaks his personal record of 13 walks

but the Cubs lose to the Braves, 12-6.

1957
Stan Musial, swinging at a 4th-inning pitch against the Phillies at Connie
Mack Stadium, tears a muscle and chips a bone, ending his consecutive-game
streak. Four days later he will pinch-run in a game suspended on July 21st,
officially giving him 895 consecutive games played and a new NL mark. The
Redbirds win today, 6-5, with the win being given to Cards reliever Billy
Muffett with 4 innings of shutout ball. Jackson was leading when replaced
by Muffett, who pitches brilliantly and is rewarded by the scorer with the
win. NL Prexy Giles will reverse the ump's decision and give the win back
to Jackson.

Led by rookie John Valentin's 1st ML homer - a grand slam off Mike Schooler -
the Red Sox gaff the visiting Marlins, 10-8. The Sox score 7 runs in their
last 3 innings to win.

1996
The Yankees claim Luis Sojo off waivers.

1997
The Tigers pound the Brewers, 16-1, with the aid of 23 hits and an 11-run
7th inning. Bobby Higginson gets 5 hits for Detroit, while Travis Fryman
and Tony Clark drive in 4 runs apiece.

In another slugfest, the Rangers score a 17-8 victory over the White
Sox. Each of the starting left fielders - Rusty Greer and Albert Belle -
hits 2 homers and drives in 6 runs for his team.

1998
In the Oriole's 6-3 win over the Indians, Cal Ripken scores his 1,500th
career run. The 'Iron Man' will cross the plate 1,647 times for Baltimore
during his 21-year career in the big leagues.

With his 52nd homerun, Mark McGwire breaks Babe Ruth's record for
round-trippers in three consecutive seasons. 'Big Red' has 162 homers in
three seasons (1996-52, 1997-58) compared to the Bambino's 161 dingers hit
in 1926-28.

1999
The Giants defeat the Brewers, 7-3. LF Barry Bonds, 2B Jeff Kent and RF
Ellis Burks hit consecutive HRs for SF in the 1st inning. It is the 2nd
time the Giants have performed the feat in 3 days.

The Diamondbacks defeat the Pirates, 7-5. Luis Gonzalez, Matt Williams and
Erubiel Durazo hit consecutive HRs for Arizona in the 1st inning.

At Shea, the Mets and Cardinals split a DH, with NY winning the opener, 8-7,
and St. Louis taking the nightcap, 7-5. Mark McGwire hits 2 HRs in the 1st
game, his 49th and 50th of the season. Number 49 breaks a light bulb in the
scoreboard, 502 feet away. This gives him a major league record 50 or more
HRs for 4 straight seasons.

2000
Hitting a solo blast and a three-run round tripper during a nine-run sixth
inning of a 14-6 victory over the Expos, Dodger first baseman Eric Karros
becomes the first player in the 111-year franchise history to hit two homers
in an inning. The Dodgers connect for 6 homers in the contest.

The Phillies defeat the Reds, 5-4, despite a grand slam by Cincinnati OF
Alex Ochoa. Ochoa's blast is the 142nd slam of the season, setting a new
major league record (previous record, 1996). The Oakland A's have hit 11,
one shy of the record shared by the Braves (1997) and Indians (1999).

Two position players take the mound in mop up rolls. Catcher Brent Mayne
is called upon after the Rockies use 9 pitchers through 11 innings against
the Braves. Mayne starts the 12th - setting a NL record for most pitchers
in a game - and allows a walk but no hits in a scoreless inning. Mayne,
who never pitched at any level, gets Chipper Jones on a ground out to end
the frame. The Rockies score to win, 7-6, in 12 innings on rookie Adam
Melhuse's 1st career hit. Mayne is the first position player to win since
Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968 (Rocky homered and threw 2 2/3 shutout
innings) and the first catcher to win a game since Buck Ewing, in 1889. Todd
Helton is 1 for 4 and finishes the game hitting .3969.

The Mets have less success using OF Derek Bell to mop up in a 16-1 loss
to the Padres. Bell, who keeps his sunglasses on, lobs in 36 pitches to 10
batters and allows 3 hits, 3 walks and 5 runs (4 earned) in his inning.

2001
Cubs OF Sammy Sosa hits 3 HRs in a game for the second time in 2 weeks as
he leads Chicago to a 16-3 win over the Brewers. Sosa is removed from the
game following his HR in the 6th inning, missing a chance to tie the ML
single-game mark of 4.

The Mariners score 6 runs in the 1st inning and 7 in the 3rd on their way
to a 16-1 victory over the Tigers. 3B David Bell gets 5 hits for Seattle,
including a double and a HR.

KC scores 7 runs in the 1st inning, but the White Sox bounce back with an
8-run 6th frame on their way to a 13-12 win over the Royals.

2003
For the fourth consecutive season, Garret Anderson reaches the 100-RBI mark
to become the first player in team history to do so. The Angels' outfielder
was also the first to have three straight 100-RBI seasons.

Sammy Sosa hits a homerun off Curt Schilling, his 500th HR as a Cub. Only
10 players in history have hit that many for one team. It is also Sammy's
30th of the season, the 9th straight season he's reached that level.

The White Sox shore up their bullpen by acquiring P Scott Sullivan from
the Reds for a player to be named.

2005
Chipper Jones drills a 2-run HR in the 4th against Carlos Zambrano, then
does the same in the 9th against reliever Kerry Wood, and the Braves win,
4-2. Tim Hudson is the CG winner.

2006
The Mets obtain OF Shawn Green from the Diamondbacks in exchange for minor
league P Evan MacLane.

The Phillies obtain INF Jose Hernandez from the Pirates for cash.

The Orioles defeat the Twins, 6-3, as OF Nick Markakis slams 3 homers.

2007
Stealing three bases in a 7-5 loss to the Padres at Shea Stadium, Mets
shortstop Jose Reyes sets a team record swiping his 67th stolen base of
the season. Roger Cedeno had established the previous mark of 66 in 1999.

Brandon Webb's scoreless streak ends at 42 innings in the first inning of
the Diamondbacks' 3-2 victory at Chase Field. The 2006 NL Cy Young Award
winner, who had thrown three straight shutouts, falls 17 innings short of
Orel Hershiser's 1988 major league record of 59 straight shutout innings.

After feeling a near game-removing pain close to the top of his right
hamstring, Albert Pujols hits a first-inning two-run homer off Scott Olse
of the Marlins at Busch Stadium to become first player to hit 30 or more
homers in his first seven seasons. It is the fifth consecutive game the
Cardinal first baseman has gone deep.

The Rangers become the first post-1900 big league team to score 30 runs in
a game. After beating the Orioles, 30-3, setting a club single-game record
29 hits in the first game of the twin bill, Texas wins the night cap, 9-7,
to break the AL mark of 36 tallies established by the 1937 Tigers during
an August 14 doubleheader against the Browns. Rangers' relief pitcher Wes
Littleton earns his second career save pitching the last three innings of
game 1. The 24-year-old reliever from Hayward, California establishes a
new major league mark for recording a save with the largest winning margin.

Appearing as the skipper in his 4,409th game, Tony LaRussa passes Bucky
Harris for third place on the all-time list for the total number of contests
managed in the major leagues. Only Connie Mack (7,755 games) and John McGraw
(4,769) have spent more time in the dugout as a manager than the current
Cardinal field boss.

2008
Joining Lou Gehrig (2,721) and Babe Ruth (2,518), Derek Jeter becomes the
third player to collect 2,500 hits in a Yankee uniform. The milestone safety
is a first-inning bloop single off Radhames Liz in New York's 9-4 comeback
victory over the Orioles in Baltimore.

In an 18-3 rout of the Braves, the Cardinals collect 26 hits tying a franchise
record established in 1930. All but five of the hits were singles, two shy
of the major league record set by the Astros in 1976.

2009
In the 14-inning 1-0 Mariners victory over Chicago, Adrian Beltre, who scores
the winning run, is hit below the belt by a ninth-inning ground ball scorched
by Alexei Ramirez. The Seattle third baseman, who doesn't wear a protective
cup because it makes him feel uncomfortable, will be placed on the disabled
list with a torn right testicle much to the chagrin of his manager.

2011
With two outs in the the eighth inning, Matt Holliday is forced to leave the
field during the game when a moth gets stuck deeply into his right ear. The
Cardinal outfielder is treated in the trainer's room where a utensil is
used to extract the embedded insect, which comes out alive.

2012
Oakland right-hander Bartolo Colon is suspended for 50 games after testing
positive for testosterone. The infraction will end the 2005 Cy Young Award
winner's season with a 10-9 record (.526) along with an ERA of 3.43 for
the playoff bound A's.

2014
Statues designed by Matt Glenn and a team of artists as tribute to the
youth sports organization are unveiled in Williamsport to commemorate the
75th anniversary of Little League. The 'Bases Loaded' project, comprised of
ten interacting commissioned sculptures, is strategically placed around the
four-corner intersection of Market and Third street to represent a diamond
as a homerun is hit, follows the history of baseball, incorporating players
from around the world.

2018
With his 20th homerun on the season by Ronald Acuna Jr against the Pittsburgh
Pirates, Acuna and Ozzie Albies of ATlanta became the first teammates in
Major League history to hit 20+ homeruns in the same season before either
player turned 22 years old.

2019
The Orioles set the record for most homeruns allowed in a season by giving
up their 259th, against the Tampa Bay Rays. Austin Meadows hit the homerun in
the third inning, breaking the mark that was set by the Cincinnati Reds during
the 2016 season. The Orioles gave up 305 homeruns to establish the new record.
