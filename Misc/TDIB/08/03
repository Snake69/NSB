the 11th.

1904
Mathewson takes 4-0 lead into the 9th against the Cubs, but after an out,
he is rattled for 4 hits, and an error to make the margin, 4-3. Shad Berry,

helps with a successful hidden ball trick on rookie Charley Malay.

1906

enter the 10th inning with a scoreless tie. Hughes decides he will have to

win a 1-0 extra-inning game with his own HR. Red Ruffing will do it in 1932.

Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Scott gives up only 2 hits to the Athletics,
but loses, 2-1.

1907
Before 17,000 in Philadelphia, A's ace Rube Waddell loses to a weakened
Cleveland team, 5-3. It's his 2nd successive Saturday loss before a big
crowd. The newspapers blame his poor performance on his visits to Atlantic
City where he, "in finishing up his prolonged spree in this city, making,
as usual, a sad spectacle of himself." (TSN)

1908
The 2nd-place Cubs stay a half game ahead of New York and 1 1/2 games
behind Pittsburgh, by beating the Phillies, 5-1. Mordecai Brown is the
winner picking up his 10th straight win over the Phillies.

7-6, in 10 innings. The Giants bail Matty out by hammering Bob Spade and
Billy Campbell.

The Athletics sweep a pair from the visiting White Sox, winning 2-1 and
10-4, though the scores take a backseat to an incident between umpire Tim
Hurst and A's 2B Eddie Collins. Doc White and the Sox take a 4-1 lead into
the 7th, but the A's score 6 runs for the lead. White is removed for Louis
Fiene and the A's continue to score in the 8th. With runners on, Collins
singles and goes to second where he appears to be safe when the throw is
dropped. When Hurst calls him out, Collins is furious and follows the ump
around the infield using words like "yellow", "crook" and "blind bat." Hurst
then turns and spits in the face of Collins before teammates pull the two
apart. After the game, police battle with fans for 20 minutes as Hurst is
hit by cushions and bottles. Hurst will be suspended by Ban Johnson tomorrow.

1910
St. Louis manager-catcher Roger Bresnahan pitches 3 1/3 innings, giving up
6 hits and no runs against Brooklyn. He last pitched in 1901, and will end
his career with a mark of 4-1 as a hurler.

1911
Against the Cubs, visiting Brooklyn gets three homers in the 5th inning
as Eddie Zimmerman, Tex Erwin and Zack Wheat connect, not consecutively,
in the 5-3 win. Zim's and Erwin's come against Lurid Lew Richie, while Fred
Toney serves up Wheat. The trio will total six homers on the year.

1912
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants score runs on two solo homers by Fred Merkle
and one by Beals Becker, off Art Fromme, to beat the Reds, 3-2. In a typical
game, Mathewson scatters 10 hits and walks none for the win. Armando Marsans
is 4 for 4 for the Reds. With the 4-0 win yesterday and today's win, the
Giants have won 15 straight.

1914
Against Detroit in the 7th inning, Yankees 25-year-old catcher Les Nunamaker
has 3 assists, nipping Sam Crawford and Bobby Veach trying to steal, and
picking off Hugh High at 2B. Detroit's next baserunner, George Burns in the
9th, gets picked off a base for the 2nd time, this time at 1B by the pitcher
King Cole. Nunamaker is the first catcher since 1887 to have 3 assists in
an inning. The Yankees lone score comes on a double steal with Nunemaker on
the front end with Fritz Maisel. New York still loses to Detroit, 4-1, as
Stanley Coveleski is the winner. Heilmann plays 2B, replacing Marty Cavanagh,
who 'played like a clown' yesterday. Nunamaker's feat is erroneously listed
in most record books as occurring in the 2nd inning; also, he is listed as
throwing out three runners in that frame when he only throws out 2.

The Giants split with the Reds, winning the opener, 7-2 behind Mathewson,
then blowing a 4-0 lead to drop the nitecap, 5-4.

At Brooklyn, Ed Konetchy hits a grand slam to deep CF in the 13th inning
to give the Pirates a 7-3 win over the Dodgers. Brooklyn loaded the bases
with no outs in the 10th and failed to score.

the starting catcher for Joe Tinker's team, replacing Artie Wilson who was
struck with appendicitis and rushed to the hospital. The Tinx other catcher

crucial series with Baltimore, the Pittfeds loan them catcher Skipper Roberts.

1918
In the first game of two with the Cards, the Phils tally 15 hits and 12
runs in the last 3 innings, but still lose, 16-12. Gene Packard cruises to
the win, while Joe Oeschger picks up one of his league leading 18 losses
in less than two innings of work. The Phils drop the nitecap, 7-1.

The Robins and Reds split, with Cincy pounding Rube Marquard in the
opener. Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 3-1. Zack Wheat hits in both contests
to run his streak to 23 straight games.

At a special meeting of AL owners in Cleveland, it is agreed that the AL
schedule will play through September 2nd, with the WS opening on September
3rd or 4th. Early indications were that the AL would vote to close down
between August 17th and August 20th, but Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the
Pirates who is there as NL representative, argues that his league would
not stop before September 2nd and would not begin the Series early.

1919
The Giants salvage the 3rd game in Cincinnati, winning 4-0. John McGraw then
adds his own bit of post-war topping on the win by yelling at the crowd,
"We beat you today and we'll be glad to get out of the home of the Huns." (as
noted by Rhodes and Snyder). His words inspire a policeman to take a swing
at McGraw, but he misses and connects with Hal Chase. Chase then slugs the
cop, and as the crowd surges, mounted policeman intercept them.

1922
The first place Browns beat the visiting A's, 9-5 behind Wright. Bill Jacobson

Vernon and Los Angeles. With McDowell and Griffin on base, Gordon Slade
of Vernon lines a single to left-center which is run down by Hood. On the
throw home. McDowell stops at 3B, but Griffin rounds 2B and heads for 3B as
well. Payne, the pitcher, cuts off the throw home and throws to 2B where
McAuley runs down Griffith for the first out. McAuley then fires to the
catcher Jenkins who puts out McAuley attempting to score for the second
out. Griffith, thinking he had not been called out, runs to 2B only to find
it occupied by Slade. Slade then ambles back to 1B but a throw to SS Clyde
Beck and a tag completes the triple play.

1927
At New York, the Yanks split a mid-week twinbill with the Tigers, losing
6-5 and then winning, 8-6. Gehrig has a homer in each to now lead Ruth,
37 to 34 homers. Ruth will hit his 35th on the 5th.

a state of semi-collapse.

Hudlin. Rube Walberg takes the loss. Connie Mack doesn't give up without
a fight though, sending in 18 players, including 5 pinch hitters.

1929
The Cubs complain about the ragged shirt sleeve on Dodger Dazzy Vance's
pitching arm, an age-old trick to distract a batter. A rule will be passed
enforcing neater dressing habits by pitchers. For the second day in a row,
Vance has not much more than a sleeve as the Cubs pound Brooklyn, 12-2,
behind Hal Carlson.

1930
In the 1st of two in a doubleheader sweep over the Braves, Chuck Klein hits
safely in his 26th consecutive game, the 2nd time this season he has run
