win over St. Louis.

slam as Boston wins, 11-10, with Pop Williams beating Menefee. Chicago wins
the opener, 7-4, with slow Bob Wicker outpitching Togie Pittinger.

1906
A Sunday crowd estimated at 30,000 are on hand in Chicago to watch the
red-hot White Sox beat the Highlanders, 3-0. The gates are closed an hour

reliever Christy Mathewson to win, 8-6. Matty takes the loss; his record
is now 17-8.

Cubs owner Charles Murphy hints that the Cards and other clubs go easy against
McGraw's Giants. Later Phils owner Horace Fogel, a former Giants manager whose
ownership of the Phils is seen as a front for Murphy and financial backer
Charles Raft of Cincinnati, echoes the accusation and charges NL umpires
with favoring the Giants. It will lead to Fogel being expelled from the NL.

1913
Art Fromme, with relief help from Mathewson, beats Brooklyn, 6-5. Matty
comes on in the 11th and gives up a lead-off triple to Zack Wheat, but the

starter Jeff Tesreau, 3-0.

1916

in the 9th as Boston wins, 2-1.

1918
At Fenway, the Yankees win their 10th of 15 games with the league leaders
by beating Boston, 2-1. Getting his opportunity because of the war, lefty
Hank Robinson is making his first ML start since 1915. He allows just 3

the winning run on a squeeze bunt, while Ruth, hitless on the afternoon,
pops out for the last out of the game.

beating the Braves, 4-0.

1922
The Wichita Falls Spudders (Texas League), winners of 24 games in a row, face
a tough opponent in grandfathered Dallas spitballer Snipe Conley. Halfway
through the game, Conley complains of a burning sensation on his lips and
mouth, limiting his ability to throw his specialty. The Spudders eventually
win, 4-3, but when the ball is examined later its revealed that a creosote
compound was rubbed into the seams, Dallas protests the game. League prexy
J. Doak Roberts upholds the protest, ending the Spudders streak at 24,
3 short of the record.

1924

adds up a triple by Babe Herman, a walk to Dale Bissonette and an Al Lopez
single for zero runs.

1931

season in 1932 before going to Brooklyn. He will die tragically in 1935.

1932
AL president Will Harridge upholds Detroit's protest of its August 1st game

At Fenway, Paul Andrews holds the A's to 5 hits and Boston beats Earnshaw,
2-1. The win snaps the Sox losing streak of 11 games.

fans with an estimated 20,000 turned away at Fenway Park where he began his
career as a pitcher 20 years ago. Ruth singles and doubles in the first game,
but the Yankees lose to Wes Ferrell, 6-4. Walks hold him to one official
at-bat in the 2nd game, which the Yankees win, 7-1, and he leaves the field
to standing cheers in the 8th inning.

over Dizzy. Big Jim Weaver wins the opener and Pat Malone is the victor
against Diz.

two homers off A's veteran Hod Lisenbee. Ferrell collects all six RBIs
in picking up the win, 6-4. Ferrell's first homer comes in the 3rd with
his brother Rick on base, and he homers again in the 4th inning with the
sacks full. The 6 RBIs ties a ML record for pitchers. The ace allows 9 hits
while striking out 8. The A's square accounts by taking the nitecap, 6-0,
behind Harry Kelley's 3-hitter.

The Senators release Wes Ferrell, who despite struggling with shoulder
problems, leads the Nats staff with a 13-8 record. Clark Griffith, who
has had differences with Ferrell over money, says Wes wasn't helping the
club. The Yankees will sign him in 2 days.

1939
At Shibe Park, the Yankeees bombard the feeble A's, 18-4, as Steve Sundra

desperate for hitting, selects P Joe Bowman to pinch-hit for Vern Kennedy
in game 1. Bowman is 0 for 42. He will hit .088 for the season.

sidelining the Cubs star for 25 of the next 27 games. The Cubs manage to
win two from the Phils, 4-3 and 12-6.

In the lid lifter at Briggs Stadium, pitcher Jim Tobin, acquired on waivers,
pitches 3 scoreless innings against New York and clubs a 3-run game-ending
homer in the bottom of the 11th to win, 9-6. Another former Brave, Jim
Turner, serves up the homer. The Tigers win the nitecap, 8-2, behind Hal
Newhouser's 18th win.

1946

3-hitter against the Cubs. The Cards win, 5-0.

game. Hal Peck leads with 4 hits and 4 runs. Pitcher Gene Bearden, who also
has 4 hits and 4 runs, is staked to 9-run lead before taking the mound. All 14
Indians who have an at-bat get a hit. Bob Feller pitches the last 2 innings.

1949
It is a long day. Boston wins the opener against the Senators, 15-7. Then
the two teams establish a new ML record for 9 innings by playing 3 hours
14 minutes. The Sox finally win, 13-11. Ortiz, for the Senators, and Vern
Stephens each drive in 5 in the opener, a CG win for Chuck Stobbs. Joe Dobson,
in relief, wins the nitecap, as the efficient Sox total 14 hits in each game.

At Ebbets Field, the Braves top the Dodgers, 5-3, in a game that Brooklyn
protests. In the 8th inning, Duke Snider belts a drive off the CF screen
that Art Gore signals as a homerun. The Braves point out that, according to
the ground rules, the ball is still in play, and Gore sends Snider back to
3B. When Duke is stranded there, the Dodgers protest. The protest will be
rejected by Ford Frick, who censors Gore for the confusion he caused by his
"bad judgment and slow thinking."

1950
The Giants' Eddie Stanky is banished by umpire Lon Warneke for refusing
to stop waving his arms in an attempt to distract Phillies batter Andy
Seminick. This is a reprise of a shuffle Stanky initiated on August 9. In
the 4th, Stanky moves over behind 2B and goes into a windup the same time
as the pitcher. Giants manager Leo Durocher had agreed to await a league
ruling on the tactic, but after Seminick knocks Hank Thompson unconscious in
a collision at 3B, Durocher turns Stanky loose. In the 4th, Seminick reaches
base on an error, then on a force at 2B he puts a linebacker block on Bill
Rigney, Stanky's replacement, and both dugouts empty for a brawl. The Phils
go on to win, 5-4, in 11 innings, on Stan Lopata's triple and a sac fly by
Waitkus. The Giants protest Stanky's ouster to no avail.

Allie Reynolds hits a bases loaded single and hurls the Yanks to a 7-2 win
over the A's. The loss goes to Scheib, but Bobby Shantz pitches the last
6 2/3 innings and clouts his only career homer, off the Chief.

1951
The Giants (59-51) start the day 13 games behind first place Brooklyn
(70-36). On Wes Westrum Day at the Polo Grounds, Sal Maglie wins the first
game against the Phillies, 3-2, and rookie Al Corwin takes the 2nd game,
2-1. Eddie Stanky returns to the lineup after a week's absence and has 5
walks in the 2 games while leading off. The sweep launches a 16-game win
streak and a spurt of 39 wins in 47 games.

Campanella breaks up a pitching duel between Newcombe and Boston's Johnny
Sain with a 3-run homer, his 2nd of the game, and the 3rd time in 9 games
he's collected a pair of homers. Campy's 5 ribbies give the Dodgers a 7-2
win. Don Newcombe wins his 16th, while Sain goes 4-13.

The Yankees, tied for first place with Cleveland, lose a pair to the A's. The
A's use 17 hits to win the opener, 9-5, then use Pennsylvania's Sunday Blue
Law at 6:59 (AL rule is 7:00 with no inning starting after 6:44) to win the
nitecap, 7-4. The Yanks start an 8th-inning 5-run rally at 6:37 and take a
9-7 lead, but the curfew wipes it out before Pete Suder can hit. Beginning
next year, the AL will adopt the 40-year-old suspended game policy of the NL.

1952

At Boston, with the A's leading, 4-3, in the 13th with 2 out, Sox George
Kell hits a fly ball down the LF line. When LF Gus Zernial attempts to
catch the ball, a fan knocks it out of his glove. Interference is called
and the A's win, 4-3.

Ford, gives up a run to avert the largest shutout win in history. Ford has
4 hits, and Berra and Martin each have 5 RBIs. Hank Bauer scores 5 runs.

record as the Tigers win, 7-3.

In an 8-4 Phils win at Pittsburgh, Robin Roberts wins his 20th of the year
and his 15th straight over the Bucs stretching back to May 20, 1951. It is

strikes out 9. He also triples in a run.

At Crosley Field, long-ball lovers enjoy 11 HRs in one game, tying the most in
any contest and setting a ML record for an extra-inning contest. Art Shamsky
hits 3 consecutive for Cincinnati, including two in extra innings. But
Pittsburgh prevails, 13-11, scoring 3 in the 13th inning. Shamsky did not
enter the game until the 8th when he hit a 2-run homer to put the Reds up,
8-7. His solo homer in the 10th ties the score at 9-9 and his 2-run homer in
the 11th ties the game at 11-11. Shamsky's pair of extra-inning homers is a
first in the NL, and just the 3rd time ever in the Majors (Vern Stephens,

In one of the ugliest brawl-filled games in ML history, the Braves beat
the Padres, 5-3, in Atlanta. The trouble begins when Atlanta's Pascual
Perez hits Alan Wiggins in the back with the first pitch of the game, and
escalates as the Padres pitchers retaliate by throwing at Perez all 4 times
he comes to the plate. All in all, the game features 2 bench-clearing brawls,
the 2nd of which includes several fans, and 19 ejections, including both
managers and both replacement managers. Padres manager Dick Williams will be
suspended for 10 days and fined $10,000, while Braves manager Joe Torre and

as Dave Campbell observed, "woke the Padres up out of their doldrums."

1995
Thanks to an odd play, the Dodgers defeat the Pirates, 11-10, in 11
innings. With the potential winning run at 3rd base, Mitch Webster of the
Dodgers swings at a pitch in the dirt. When Pittsburgh rookie C Angelo
Encarnacion casually picks up the ball with his mask, Dodger manager
Tommy Lasorda appeals, citing the rule which awards a runner 2 bases if a

the stands, mistakenly thinking the ball was the 3rd out of the inning,
