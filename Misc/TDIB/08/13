1901
Kid Nichols and Christy Mathewson face each other again and both throw
shutout ball for 9 innings. Boston finally scores three in the 10th to win,
3-0. Matty's record for the past month is 3-7. Nichols and Mathewson will
go at each other tomorrow, in the 2nd game of two, with the match ending
in an 11-inning 5-5 tie.

1902
In the 6th inning of a game with the Tigers, Harry Davis of the A's attempts
a double steal with Dave Fultz, who is on 3B. But Davis does not draw a
throw as he goes into 2B. On the next pitch he "steals" 1B without a throw
by pitcher George Mullin. The next time he steals 2B he does draw a throw
and in the rundown Fultz scores and Davis then reaches 2B, with both getting
credit for a steal. This double steal maneuver will be attempted in later
years by Fred Tenney (July 31, 1908) and Germany Schaefer (August 4, 1911),
though the details are contradictory. The Athletics plate 17 runs in the
twinbill sweep, while the Tigers never score.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader in Boston, Pirate Honus Wagner steals 2B,
3B and home in the 7th inning. Wagner also did it in 1899. Pittsburgh splits,
losing 8-6 and then winning, 6-1.

1903
New York wins its 3rd doubleheader in a week, clipping St. Louis 6-2 and
9-7. Mathewson strikes out 10 in the opener as he outpitches Three Finger
Brown.

1906
The Cubs' Jack "Brakeman" Taylor is knocked out by Brooklyn in the 3rd inning,
breaking a string of 187 complete games and 15 relief appearances in which
he finished each game (1727 total innings). The ML record run began June
20th, 1901. In 10 years he will fail to finish only 8 of 286 starts. With
relief help from Orval Overall, Chicago wins, 11-3.

The host Giants sweep the Pirates, winning 6-1 and 2-1. Hooks Wiltse is
the winner in the opener, while Mathewson matches him in the nitecap. Spike
Shannon's 9th inning single off Lefty Leifield brings home the game-winner
in the 2nd game.

1908
Cy Young Day is celebrated by 20,000 in Boston. He pitches briefly against
an All-Star team that includes Jack Chesbro, Hal Chase, Willie Keeler,
Harry Davis and George Mullin. The game is interrupted several times for
presentations to the great hurler, including a great loving cup from the AL
for all his accomplishments. This is Keeler's last appearance this season,
as he returns home to Brooklyn, partly in protest to Highlander manager Kid
Elberfeld's surly managerial style (as stated in Jim Reiseler's book "Before
They Were Bombers"). Keeler quits without pay saying, "I cannot give you
a run for your money". He had been ill and muffed a flyball in left field,
but he will return next season to play under manager George Stallings.

The Giants drop the Superbas, 5-3, behind Red Ames and Mathewson. Mathewson
pitches 7 innings of shutout ball for the win.

1910
In the most evenly matched game ever, the Pirates and Superbas each have 8
runs, 13 hits, 38 at-bats, 5 strikeouts, 3 walks, 1 hit batter, 1 passed
ball, 13 assists, 27 putouts, 2 errors and use 2 pitchers. Darkness ends
the game at an 8-8 tie before the symmetry does.

1911
The Pirates' Elmer Steele throws just 72 pitches in subduing the Superbas,
9-0. Steele gives up no walks and has no strikeouts, and allows just one
hit - a one-out 9th inning single to light-hitting Tex Erwin. Brooklyn
so admires the feat they obtain him on September 16th, but he never wins
another game in the ML.

Ty Cobb, apparently believing the Tigers can no longer win the pennant race,
begins a vacation.

1913
Goober southpaw Harry Hedgpeth pitches two complete nine-inning games when
he starts both ends of a Virginia League doubleheader against Richmond. In
the opener, the Peterburg pitcher one-hits the Colts, 1-0, and then follows
up the gem with a 10-0 no-hitter.

In a great pickup, the Cubs send P Lew Richie to Kansas City (AA) for Hippo
Vaughn. Vaughn, who had pitched 5 years with little success in the AL with New
York and Washington, will be a workhorse for Chicago. Tomorrow the Cubs will
ship 33-year-old Ed Reulbach (1-3) to Brooklyn for P Eddie Stack and cash.

Doc Crandall is rescued from the basement ... John McGraw buys him back
from the Cards 12 days after trading him. According to historian Merritt
Clifton, Doc has a sore arm and is sent back as damaged goods. He will
pitch for Brattleboro to get his arm in shape before rejoining the Giants
for the stretch drive.

1914
In the start of a crucial series in New York, The Braves pound Rube Marquard
for 11 hits to win, 5-3. Rabbit Maranville contributes a triple and Les
Mann adds a homer and 2-run single. Lefty Tyler notches another victory.

1915
Grover Cleveland Alexander wins his 20th, 5-3, as the Phillies beat Boston's
Dick Rudolph.

1916
On a muddy Robison Field in St. Louis, the Cards drill 23 hits in game
one to defeat the Pirates in 11 innings, 9-8. The hit total is a ML-high
for the 1916 season. Game two begins at 6 p.m. and when the Bucs score
8 runs in the first two innings, Pittsburgh hurries to get the game in,
while on the other side of the field, the Cards begin to dally. The Cards'
Dot Miller singles and then steals 2B and 3B on one pitch as pitcher Al
Mamaux and C Bill Fischer ignore him. The Cards "steal" 11 bases, while the
Bucs add three in just 5 innings before the umps and darkness mercifully
end it. Pittsburgh wins, 9-5. The steal rule will eventually be amended to
not credit a runner when the defense ignores him.

1920
In a Friday game at Cleveland, the Yankees complete a 4-game sweep of the
leading Indians by beating them, 4-3. Shawkey is the winner with relief
help from Carl Mays. The Indians leave for their final Eastern swing with
a 70-40 record, with New York and Chicago both at 72-42.

At the Polo Grounds, Fred Toney makes 3 wild pitches, all of which figure
in the scoring, as he loses to Brooklyn, 4-2. Two of the heaves come in
the 4th with the bases loaded and all 3 runs score. The last comes in the
8th and puts Myers in a position to score.

1921
Boston Braves P John "Mule" Watson hurls 2 complete-game victories over the
Phillies, winning by scores of 4-3 and 8-0. It is the 3rd doubleheader he
has pitched, the first 2 being with the A's in 1918.

George Sisler continues his hot hitting, collecting 2 doubles and hitting
for the cycle in a 10-inning 7-5 win at Detroit. Sisler is 5 for 5.

In Philadelphia, 33,000 fans - the largest crowd to watch a game in
Philadelphia since 1914 - see Carl Mays win his 15th straight over the
Mackmen as the Yankees prevail, 7-2, in game 1. Bob Shawkey coasts home to
a 13-7 win in the nitecap. Meusel homers in each game.

1922
The New York Yankees' Everett Scott nears 1,000 consecutive games played,
but it takes an extra effort to keep the streak alive. He spends $40 to
hire a car to get to Chicago in time for the game after a train he is on
is wrecked. Washington wins, 3-2.

Led by SS Charles Hollocher's 3 triples the Cubs cook the Cardinals,
16-5. Hollocher is in the middle of his best season, and will hit .340
while leading the loop in fielding for the 2nd straight year.

1923
In the 2nd game of the afternoon in Washington, Chicago's Earl Sheely hits
a 2-run homer in the 8th inning to beat Walter Johnson, 3-2. Dixie Leverett
is the winning pitcher. Washington wins game 1, 5-4.

1924
The Yankees regain the AL lead with 1-0 and 2-1 wins over the Browns.

Red Sox righthander Howard Ehmke has the White Sox popping up all day in
his 6-0 win. Only one assist is made by Boston, none by the infield. Red
Faber takes the loss. Boston comes back in game 2 to win, 4-1, as Curt
Fullerton beats Sloppy Thurston for the sweep.

1926
In a dispute stretching back to last season, Pittsburgh players ask that
Fred Clarke, now assistant to owner Barney Dreyfuss, not be permitted
to sit on the bench. Sam Dreyfuss, filling in for his father who is in
Europe, squelches the revolt by releasing Carson Bigbee and Babe Adams,
and suspending Max Carey, who has slumped to .222. Carey is waived to the
Dodgers. Manager Bill McKechnie will fill in till the end of the year,
to be replaced by Donie Bush, Indianapolis manager. The three players
protest to NL president Heydler, who absolves them of insubordination,
but also confirms the owner's right to get rid of them.

The only game played today is in Washington, where Lou Gehrig clouts homers
in the 4th and 5th innings off Walter Johnson, only the 2nd time in his
career that the Washington star has surrendered 2 homers to one player. The
Yankees win, 7-5.

1928
Lefty Grove holds the Tigers to two 4th-inning singles to give the host A's
a 7-1 win. Grove wins his 9th straight and 17 of the year. The A's (72-39)
still trail the Yankees (77-35) who are idle today.

The Braves send INF Eddie Moore to Toledo (American Assoc.) in exchange for
lefty OF Heine Mueller. Moore will go back to Boston briefly after the AA
season ends.

1931
Tony Cuccinello wakes up the last-place Reds by going 6 for 6, with 3 singles,
2 doubles and a triple, as Cincy wins the first game, 17-3, of a doubleheader
against Boston. Cuccinello doesn't stop there, belting a 3-run homer in the
8th of the nitecap to give the Reds a 4-2 win. 'Cooch' has 8 RBIs for the day.

1932
After blanking Washington for nine innings in a scoreless tie, Red Ruffing
hits a solo homerun in the top of the tenth. The right-hander then closes
out the Senators in the bottom of the frame to preserve the Yankees'
1-0 victory. It looked like the Yankees' scoring streak might be broken
until Ruffing's HR. The losing pitcher is Al Thomas. Tom Hughes, in 1906,
was the only other ML pitcher to hit an extra-inning, game-winning HR in a
1-0 match. Ruffing fans 12 and allows just three hits in leading the Yanks
to their 6th straight win.

Bill Terry, Mel Ott and Freddie Lindstrom hit HRs on consecutive pitches in
the 4th inning against Brooklyn in a doubleheader opener before 48,000. Terry
collects 3 HRs in his 4 hits and Mel Ott a pair, as both of them hit
back-to-back homers twice today, just the 4th time in history. But Dodger P
Sloppy Thurston lives up to his name by winning, 18-9, despite serving up
6 homers. Sloppy collects 4 of the 24 hits himself, while O'Doul has four
singles in the 4th-through-6th-inning carnage. Cuccinello, Taylor and Hack
Wilson all homer as the Dodgers score 18 runs in the three innings. Wilson
adds a triple and a single and passes the 100-RBI mark. Starter Jim Mooney is
the loser. The Giants also lose the 2nd game, 5-4, as Brooklyn hits 3 HRs -
Stripp, O'Doul and Cuccinello - off Waite Hoyt. Ott adds his 3rd homer of
the day, #35, off Fred Heimach, to move one behind Klein for the league lead.

The Reds' Eppa Rixey blanks the Pirates, 3-0, and drives in two runs
on a single and a triple. It's Rixey's 3rd win of the year - all over
Pittsburgh. Bill Swift gives up two runs in 8 innings to lose.

Commissioner Landis clears Rogers Hornsby of charges of fraudulently
"borrowing" money from Cubs players. The Chicago papers said Hornsby had
obtained money from players, either loaned to him to bet on horse races,
or to share in joint ventures. When Hornsby is fined, the players want
refunds. Hornsby wants a lump payoff by the Cubs, who refuse. Landis holds
several hearings, and as he doesn't punish anyone, it is taken as exoneration.

The A's sweep a pair from the Red Sox, winning 13-2 and 8-2. Lefty Grove
allows six hits and K's 11 in the opener. In the nitecap, Tony Freitas,
the Portuguese portsider, scatters nine hits in winning his 8th straight.

1933
At Fenway, the Red Sox score 11 runs in the bottom of the first, then hold
on to win 19-10 over the A's.

Holding a 5-4 lead with none on and 2 outs in the 9th, the White Sox give
up a single and Hank Greenberg's 3rd double of the game as the Tigers tie
at 5 all. Greenberg's 4th hit, a single in the 17th off starter Ted Lyons,
is followed by Doljack's game-winning triple as the Tigers prevail, 6-5. Vic
Sorrel, who beat Lyons on August 2, allows 14 hits in his first 8 innings
pitched, but just 3 in the last 9 to earn the win. Lyons almost loses in
the 11th but OF Al Simmons throws out two runners in succession at home
trying to score from 2B on singles.

1934
In a preview of the WS, the Cardinals play the Tigers in an exhibition game
in Detroit. The Deans refuse to make the trip, having both pitched and lost
in a doubleheader the day before. Dizzy is fined $100 and Paul $50.

1937
The Hellenic Societies of Chicago hold a day for Alex Kampouris of the
visiting Reds. He gets a car, and the Cubs get a 22-6 win, as Kampouris makes
3 errors and fans twice. The Reds total eight errors and the league-leading
Cubs total 22 hits - four each by Frank Demaree and Ken O'Dea. Charlie Root
is the winner over Bill Hallahan, who started the fateful 4th inning when
the Cubs score 9 runs on 8 hits and 4 errors.

Lou Fette (14-4) tops Waite Hoyt as the Bees sting the Dodgers, 5-2. Cookie
Lavagetto's two errors in the 8th plus Gene Moore's triple let in two
runs. Vince DiMaggio's 10th homer is the final tally.

The Giants make nine hits - seven for extra bases - to down the last-place
Phillies, 5-0. Carl Hubbell has two hits in winning his 16th, tops in the
majors. Sam Leslie has a triple and a homer, while Harry Danning has a
homer and three RBIs.

1939
The Giants hit three successive solo HRs in the 4th inning, with Alex
Kampouris, P Bill Lohrman and Joe Moore connecting. It is the 2nd time in two
months that Moore has followed back to back HRs with one of his own. Zeke
Bonura adds a 4th solo HR to set a ML record, since tied, for solo shots
in an inning. The Giants add 3 more HRs - Demaree (2) and Bob Seeds - to
beat the Phils, 11-2, in the opener of two. It is also the second time this
season they have banged 7 homers, and rookie pitcher Bill Kersieck gives up
all but one. Seeds, incidentally, is the only major leaguer to own a minor
league team; he is owner and president of Amarillo (NM-West Texas League).

After losing to the A's, 12-9 in game 1, the 2nd game is mercifully called
after eight innings with the Yankees beating the A's 21-0 to equal the ML
record for lopsided shutouts. Joe DiMaggio and Babe Dahlgren each have a
pair of HRs, one each inside-the-park. Red Ruffing collects 4 hits along
with pitching a four-hitter. Cotton Pippen takes the loss; the A's will
waive him next month to the Tigers. With the win yesterday and the 23-2
win on June 28, the Yankees have now scored 18 or more runs against the
A's three times this year. The next team to top 17 runs three times against
one team will be the 2005 Yankees against Tampa Bay.

1940
The Indians move 2 games in front by besting the Tigers again, 6-5. Cleveland
will win their next 2 games to go up by 3.

1941
3B coach Leo Durocher admits to napping as the Phils' Bobby Bragan nabs
Dixie Walker at 2B with the hidden ball trick. The Dodgers still win, 7-2,
behind Davis.

1943
Against the Red Sox, White Sox SS Luke Appling collects his 2,000th career
hit as the Pale Hose win, 3-2.

1944
The Red Sox fly in pitcher Rex Cecil from San Diego. He arrives minutes
before the start of a twinbill with the Browns. Cecil relieves in the first
game, a 7-6 Sox win in 13 innings, pitching the last 4 innings, allowing
no runs. Vern Stephens has a pair of homers, while Culbertson's homer ties
the game in the 9th. Bobby Doerr homers in the 13th to end it. Nels Potter
wins the nitecap, 6-1, in 5 innings.

The Senators cop a pair from Cleveland, winning 2-1 behind Mickey Haeffner
and 4-1 behind Early Wynn in game 2. Stan Spence hits a 3-run homer in the
1st inning, and SS John Sullivan is 3 for 3 and starts an AL-record 5 DPs,
the most started by an AL shortstop since 1905.

In the Negro League All-Star game at Comiskey Park, a sweltering 46,000
watch the West beat the East, 7-4. The winning pitcher is starter Verdel
Mathis, while Josh Gibson hits a 440 foot homer in the 7th. Satchel Paige,
in a dispute over gate receipts, does not play. Satch wants them donated
to charity.

At Cincinnati, the Giants boot their way to a doubleheader loss to the Reds,
4-3 and 9-2. In the 4th inning of the nitecap, The Reds score 4 runs on
one hit, mostly with the help of a ML-record tying 3 errors by New York 2B
George Hausmann. Jim Konstanty is the winner, while Shoun takes the win in
game 1. NY's Nap Reyes has 6 straight hits before making an out in the 7th
of game 2.

1945
Branch Rickey becomes the principal stockholder of the Dodgers. He and
associates Walter O'Malley and John Smith acquire the 50 percent interest
of the Ebbets estate for a reported price of $750,000.

1946
Boston's Dave Ferriss wins his 8th straight for his 20th win, defeating the
Athletics, 7-5. Ferriss is the first pitcher to win 20 games in his first
two seasons since Wes Ferrell in 1929-30.

In Cleveland, more than 65,000 are on hand at Municipal Stadium to see
Bob Feller take on Detroit's Dizzy Trout. Feller pitches no hit ball for
6 innings, but a walk and two singles in the 8th scores a run for Detroit,
and Cleveland loses, 1-0. Feller strikes out 7 to run his total to 262.

1947
At Sportsman's Park, pinch-hitter Willard Brown of the Browns becomes the
first black player to hit a homerun in the American League. The historic
homer, an inside-the-parker off future Hall of Fame hurler Hal Newhouser,
helps the Browns beat the Tigers, 6-5.

1948
The promise of Satchel Paige on the mound brings 51,013 to Comiskey Park
to see "Ole Satch" pitch his first ML shutout as Cleveland wins, 5-0. He
gives up five hits to run his record to 5-1. In his 12 appearances, Paige
has attracted 201,829 fans. Teammate Larry Doby has 2 hits and 2 stolen bases.

At Shibe Park, the Phils score 10 runs in the bottom of the 1st inning,
including a ML-record 9 runs before the first out is recorded, then hold
on to beat the Giants, 10-7. Rookie Curt Simmons lasts 6 innings for the win.

1949
Vern Stephens gives Boston a 5-1 win over the Senators by clouting a
12th-inning grand slam. Ellis Kinder (14-5) goes the rout for Boston.

1950
In the bottom of the twenty-second inning, with both starting pitchers
still in the game, Don Richmond lines a single down the right-field line
plating Dick Cole to give Rochester a 3-2 victory over Jersey City at Red
Wing Stadium. Tom Poholsky, after yielding two unearned runs in the top
of the second, goes on to hurl 20 consecutive scoreless innings for the
complete-game victory, but is matched zero-for-zero, until the last inning,
by opposing J. C. Giants pitcher Andy Tomasic, who also goes the distance
after giving up single runs in the first and second frames.

The Giants earn a split with the Phils as Jim Hearn shuts out the Whiz Kids,
2-0. But the Phils will take 11 of their next 14 games to hold a 7-game
edge over 2nd-place Brooklyn.

1951
Where's Steve Sax when you need him? At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers offer up
one of the odder promotions in "Music Depreciation Night," and every fan
with a musical instrument is admitted free. 2,426 fans take advantage of the
offer, including one with a piano. The Dodgers have a motive in countering the
local musicians' union, which wants to silence the non-union Sym-Phoney. The
Dodgers outplay the Braves, 7-6, as Gil Hodges belts a 3-run homer in the
8th, following an intentional walk to Campanella, who had earlier homered.

The Giants keep pace with a 5-2 win over the Phils. Larry Jansen, pitching for
the first time in 8 days, wins his 15th. Whitey Lockman hits a 3-run homer.

1954
In a brilliant pitcher's duel, Chicago's Jack Harshman and Detroit's Al Aber
go head to head for 16 innings before the Sox win it on a one-out run scoring
triple by Minnie Minoso. Nellie Fox scores from 1st. Harshman strikes out
12 and has now pitched 28 consecutive scoreless innings. Wayne Belardi,
who enters in the 13th inning, bats out of turn in the 15th and bats his
regular turn in the next inning.

on Jim Finigan's steal of home in the 8th.

1955

games. Larry Doby makes his first error in the OF after 165 errorless games
for a new AL record.

1957
Pitcher Lew Burdette of the Braves hits his first 2 career homers and beats
the Redlegs, 12-4. He'll have a 2nd two-homer game next July 10.

Before Boston's largest crowd of the season, 35,647, Mickey Mantle goes
3 for 3 and drives in 3 runs as the Yankees edge the Red Sox, 3-2. Mantle
improves his average to .384 while Ted Williams, with 1 for 2, is at .388. A
week later Mantle will injure himself when he angrily swings a golf club
at a branch and gouges his shinbone. This will effectively take him out of
the running for a 2nd-straight triple crown.

1958
Dodger P Fred Kipp relieves in the 9th and throws one pitch to retire Walt
Moryn, then wins his 5th when Elmer Valo hits a pinch double to beat the
Cubs, 6-5.

Despite allowing two 3-run pinch homers to Rip Repulski and Bob Bowman,

Ed Donnelly is the winner.

1961
In the first of two with the Senators, Maris belts his 44th homer to tie
Mantle. An inning later, Mantle hits a Bennie Daniels offering for his 45th,

the 1st inning in game 2 as the Yanks win, 9-4.

1962
Bert Campaneris of Daytona Beach (Florida State League) pitches ambidextrously
in a relief appearance. Facing Ft. Lauderdale, Campy throws lefty to
lefthanders, and switches when righthanders come up.

1963
At County Stadium, Warren Spahn hurls a complete game beating Los Angeles,
4-3. During the game, the crafty southpaw whiffs five Dodgers to establish
the all-time strike out record for left-handers with 2,382.

At Crosley Field, the Reds and Giants deal aces as Jim Maloney outpitches
Juan Marichal to win, 4-0. Maloney allows just 2 hits.

into first place with a 3-2 win.

1968

the Senators, 8-4. Washington's Jim Hannan (7-3) takes the loss and doesn't
help himself at-bat, striking out for the 13th straight time since July 24.

1969
With a unanimous vote, the major league owners elect Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn to a seven-year term.

Baltimore's Jim Palmer leaves no doubt about his comeback with an 8-0
no-hitter against Oakland. Reggie Jackson, leading the AL with 42 HRs,
walks 3 times, as the A's drop 2 games behind the Twins in the West. Palmer,
now 11-2, pushes the O's lead to a comfortable 14 1/2 games in the first
American League East Division race ever.

Bill Hands pitches a complete game 4-2 win over San Diego. Chicago now has
a seemingly comfortable 8 1/2 game lead.

Joe Pepitone returns to the Yankees but does not play in their 5-2 loss
to the Twins. Rich Reese is 4 for 4 with 2 homers and 2 singles to drive
in 4 runs for the Twins as Jim Kaat is the winner over Mel Stottlemyre
(16-9). Reese will have hits his first 3 at-bats tomorrow before flying out.

beating the visiting Cubs, 8-2. The lone Cub safety is a 2-out double by
Cleon Jones in the 8th inning. Granger pitches a hitless 9th.

1972
Bengals manager Billy Martin literally picks his starting lineup out of
a hat in an attempt to halt the Tigers' 4-game losing streak. He chooses
his starting 8, then Al Kaline picks from there. Norm Cash leads off with
Eddie Brinkman batting cleanup. The ploy works as Detroit defeats Cleveland,
3-2. Using a regular lineup in the nightcap, the Tigers lose 9-2.

1973
Roy White homers from both sides of the plate as the Yankees top the
Angels, 6-0.

1975
The A's release P Jim Perry and purchase OF Tommy Harper from the Angels. For
Perry it is the end of his 17-year ML career.

1977
Against visiting Seattle, the Red Sox have two outs in the 6th inning,
and then unload back-to-back-to-back homers by George Scott, Butch Hobson
and Dwight Evans. The Red Sox win, 13-6.

1978
The Yankees erupt for 5 runs in the 7th inning to take a 5-3 lead over the
Orioles before heavy rains force a delay of the game. Thanks to the stalling
tactics of Earl Weaver and some slow-moving Baltimore groundskeepers,
the game is called, and the score reverts to the last complete inning. The
Orioles win 3-0, with Scott McGregor the winner. This rule will be changed
in 1980, and the game today would have been suspended.

1979

1995
At Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, baseball legend Mickey
Mantle, 63, succumbs to liver cancer with his estranged wife Merlyn at his
side. Ironically, prior to a moving tribute in the Bronx ballpark for the
fallen hero, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard displays "At Bat:  7" until the
start of the game because the lead-off batter for the Indians, Kenny Lofton,
wears number 7.

The Dodgers take sole possession of first place in the NL West with a 4-1
win over the Pirates. Eric Karros hits a 2-run homer and Todd Worrell ices

1996
After failing to score in the first 3 innings, the Giants proceed to plate

exchange for P Tony Armas and a player to be named.

and move into 24th place on the career K list.

1999
In the first game of a DH, the Expos defeat the Rockies, 14-13, after the
score is tied at 1 apiece after 4 innings. Each team scores 5 runs in the

and the Astros never look back, beating the Cubs, 9-5. Shane Reynolds is
the winner, now 7-0 against Chicago. The Cubs fall out of first place as
the Astros take over.

2002
Warring Mets co-owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday finally complete
their deal to transfer full ownership of the team to Wilpon within the next
30 days. But Nelson will question the valuation of the team by the independent
arbitrator, and the transaction will not be resolved until the fall.

2003
After missing nearly three months with a groin injury, Mike Piazza makes
a dramatic return to the New York lineup as he homers and drives in five
runs on Italian Night at Shea Stadium. The backstop's 3 for 5 performance,
including a homerun in the third inning, RBI single in the fourth and a
two-run single in the seventh, contributes to the Mets' 9-2 victory over
the Giants.

Just as starting pitcher Javier Vazquez is about to throw a full count
pitch to Rockies outfielder Jay Payton, a second inning hour-long blackout
at the enclosed Olympic Stadium leaves the fans and players in total
darkness. Tomorrow the team arrives in New York on their off-day just in
time to experience a massive blackout which leaves more than 50 million
Americans in the dark.

Mike Mordecai hits his 2nd homer of the year and his second extra-inning
homer to give Florida a 2-1 win over the Dodgers. Mordecai hit a game-winning
extra-inning HR on July 23, his first homer in two years. His last homer
before that, for Montreal on August 8, 2001, was also an extra-inning game
winner. The winning pitcher today is rookie Nate Bump (4-0) who also was
the winner on Mordecai's last homer.

2004
At Seattle's Boeing Field, Edgar Martinez is on hand to greet George
W. Bush. The President, who had requested to meet the retiring designated
hitter, exchanges autographed baseballs with the man who routinely helped
the Mariners beat his Rangers when the chief executive was the managing
partner of Texas.

At Citizens Bank Ballpark, the Giants rout the Phillies by a score of
16-6. JT Snow hits 3 HRs (25% of his homers this season) for SF, drives in
4 runs, and scores 5 himself. The light-hitting first baseman goes deep in
the first inning with a two-run dinger off starter Brett Myers, and then
delivers solo shots off relievers in the fifth and seventh frames. Barry
Bonds is walked 3 times, twice intentionally. The 2 intentional walks give
him a ML record 86 on the season, helping the Giants break their 2-year-old
ML record of intentional walks in a season with 104.

The Royals hit a ML-record tying 2 grand slams in a 10-3 romp over
Oakland. Rookies Abraham Nunez and John Buck both connect with the bags
full for KC. Nunez' salami breaks up Mark Mulder's 1-0 shutout in the 6th
and is the first grand slam allowed by Mulder.

Starting pitcher Jon Rauch of the Expos homers off Houston's Roger Clemens
(Shawn Estes is the only other pitcher to do so) but leaves with a bad back
and a 4-0 lead. The Astros tie it up and then score a run in the 12th on a
homer by Morgan Ensberg. Alex Gonzalez matches that in the bottom of the frame
and Terrmel Sledge drives in the winner with a single as the Expos win, 6-5.

2005
The Braves down the Diamondbacks, 9-5, as ancient Julio Franco has a 3-run HR
and 4 RBIs. Hot hitting rookie Jeff Francouer (.388) is just 1 for 4 but does
throw out a runner. He will notch 9 outfield assists in his first 35 games.

Clint Barmes' 2-run single ignites a six-run 2nd inning for the Rockies
and they beat the Dodgers, 6-4. Sunny Kim (5-2) is the winner. The Dodgers
outfield helps the Rocks' scoring as each Dodger outfielder is charged with
an error. Left fielder Rickie Ledee starts with a throwing error and RF Jose
Cruz, Jr, follows with a fielding error on the next play. One play later,
CF Jason Werth completes the trifecta by bobbling a ball for the third
outfield error of the inning. According to Retrosheet, it was the first
time since 1960 that all three of a team's outfielders have been charged
with an error in the same inning.

For the third time this season the Yankees score 17+ runs against the Devil
Rays, winning today 17-3. This was the 3rd time the Yankees scored 17+
runs in a game against the Devil Rays. The last time a team did that to
another team was the 1939 Yankees, vs. the Athletics. Despite the loss,
the Devil Rays win the season series, 11-6.

Josh Beckett and the Marlins beat the Astros, 4-2, in Houston. Paul LoDuca's
2-run HR in the 8th snaps a 2-2 tie. Carlos Delgado has 3 hits including
his 30th homerun of the year, the 9th straight season he's reached that
plateau. Only 3 players in history have longer streaks with Barry Bonds
doing it 13 straight seasons.

Luis Gonzalez of the Diamondbacks is recognized for his philanthropic
efforts by being named winner of the Branch Rickey Award for 2005.

2006
LA's Greg Maddux and SF's Jason Schmidt hook up in a classic West Coast
pitcher's duel, reminiscence of match-ups of Koufax and Marichal, as
the Dodgers beat the Giants, 1-0, thanks to Russell Martin's 10th inning
walk-off homerun. When Giants slugger Barry Bonds lines into a double play
in the first inning it marks the only time in baseball history, a 300 game
winner pitches to a batter with over 700 homers.

He should've used the force. The Indians score 11 runs in the 1st inning off
Luke Hudson, who manages just one out, on their way to a 13-0 whitewashing
of the Royals at Jacobs Field. It is the most runs allowed in the first
inning by a pitcher since Kid Nichols on September 21, 1897. Hudson is the
first pitcher in 40 years to not record an out against the 1st ten batters
he faces. Travis Hafner hits his 6th grand slam (and 35th HR total) of the
season off Hudson to tie Don Mattingly's ML record set in 1987.

The Reds down the Phillies, 7-5, in 11 innings as Juan Castro and Ken Griffey
Jr drive in the final runs. The Phils tied it in the 9th on a 2-out single
by Ryan Howard, who earlier hit his 41st homer. Edwin Encarnacion, Adam
Dunn and Rich Aurilia hit consecutive HRs for Cincinnati in the 6th inning.

In pitching 8 shutout innings against the Giants, Greg Maddux sets a
major-league record becoming the first pitcher to make at least 25 starts
in 20 consecutive seasons. Maddux had shared the record of 25 in 19 straight
with Cy Young, Warren Spahn and Tom Glavine. The 1-0 win today goes to Takashi
Saito when Russell Martin hits a walkoff homer in the 10th off Vinnie Chulk.

The Red Sox defeat the Orioles, 11-9. Manny Ramirez is held hitless, ending
his 27-game hitting streak for Boston.

2007
Playing his 144th straight game without an error, Placido Polanco establishes
a big league record for second basemen. The Detroit infielder, who hasn't
made a misplay since July 2 of last season, surpasses the previous mark
set by Luis Castillo, while playing for the Twins.

For the first time in 1,303 games, Nomar Garciaparra of the Dodgers is
ejected from a game. The 12-year veteran infielder, who is tossed by home
plate umpire Tom Hallion for arguing a called third strike in the fourth
inning, is restrained by first base coach Mariano Duncan as he continues
to shout and points his bat toward the umpire.

2010
A day after major league baseball formally approves the sale of the team,
the new owners of the Rangers, which includes Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan,
announce lower prices for concessions, parking and merchandise. The lowering
of prices is one way of showing appreciation to the Texas fans for their
loyalty and support, according to sports attorney Chuck Greenberg, another
new owner the club.

The Giants obtain Jose Guillen from Kansas City, hoping the well-travelled
veteran can help the club down the stretch run. The departure of the
34-year-old, who has played with ten teams in the past 14 years and designated
for assignment by the Royals last week, gives highly touted prospect Kila
Ka'aihue an opportunity to play everyday.

2013
For only the second time in big league history beginning in 1916, the
earliest year the records are available, the leadoff batters for both teams
homer in their first at-bat and and then add another round-tripper in the
same game when Seattle's Brad Miller and Tampa Bay's Ben Zobrist each hit a
pair of homers in the Mariners' 5-4 win at Tropicana Field. Chuck Knoblauch
of the Twins and Detroit's Tony Phillips last accomplished the feat in 1994
at Tiger Stadium.

2015
The Toronto Blue Jays became the first Major League franchise since the 1954
Cleveland Indians to have compiled two different 11-game winning streaks
within the same season.

2019
Rafael Devers went 6 for 6 with four doubles against the Cleveland Indians,
becoming the first player in Major League history to record six or more
hits and four or more doubles in one game.

Chris Sale recorded his 2,000th career strikeout by getting Oscar Mercado in
the third inning against the Cleveland Indians. He became the 83rd pitcher
to reach this mark. Sale also became the fastest pitcher in Major League
history to record 2,000 strikeouts. He accomplished this feat in 1,626
innings, breaking the record of 1,711 1/3 innings set by Pedro Martinez.
