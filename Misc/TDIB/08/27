win his own game against the A's, 4-2.

Phillies pitchers manage to walk 17 Brooklyn batters but lose by only one
run, 11-10.

1904
At Robison Field, the Giants score 7 runs in three innings off Jack Taylor
and Mathewson eases to a 9-3 win over the Cards.

1906
The Cubs win their 9th in a row, beating the Phils, 5-2, and taking a 12
1/2 game lead.

In a 6-inning game ended by rain, Ed Walsh strikes out 9 and allows one
hit to beat the A's, 1-0.

1907
Christy Mathewson fashions a 3-hit shutout over the Cardinals and drives
in the only run with a double. Ed Karger takes the hard luck loss.

At New York, Boston's Cy Young stops the Highlanders, 5-1. Jack Chesbro
takes the loss.

1908
With electric bulletin boards also showing the action in Chicago, the Colts
arrive back home for a three-game sweep to move within one-half game of
the lead. Behind Jack Pfiester, Chicago wins today over New York, 5-1,
then takes the day off tomorrow.

1909
Still pitching doubleheaders, Joe "Iron Man" McGinnity wins a pair for
Newark over Buffalo in the Eastern League.

1910
In the first of 2, Highlander P Jack Warhop swipes home in the 6th. His
run is the difference as New York beats the White Sox, 4-3.

At Chicago's West Side Park, Chicago pulls off a 3rd-inning triple play -
2B Johnny Evers to 3B Heinie Zimmerman - against the Giants, but New York
wins handily, 18-9. The Giants tally 23 hits to the Cubs' 15 in beating
the league-leaders.

In Boston, Red Sox hurler Sea Lion Hall pitches a 7-1 one-hit win over
Cleveland. Koestner's single is the only hit.

Inventor George Cahill brings his patented lighting system to White Sox
Park. Using twenty 137,000 candlepower arc lights, 2 amateur teams play a
night game before 20,000. However, the first AL night game won't be played
there until 1939.

Washington 2B Red Killefer sets a since-tied ML mark by sacrificing 4 times
in the first game of a doubleheader against visiting Detroit. He then bunts
his first time up in game 2 to set a ML mark of straight sac bunts (according
to historian Ernie Lanigan) as Washington sweeps a pair, 3-1 and 5-4.

1911
At Comiskey Park, Chicago's Ed Walsh pitches a 5-0 no-hitter against the
Red Sox. A 4th-inning walk produces the only Red Sox runner. After going
18-20 in 1910, Walsh bounces back to win 27 and lead the AL in games (56),
IP (369) and strikeouts (255). The future Hall of Famer's son, Edward Arthur,
will also pitch for the White Sox 1928-1932.

1912
It takes a one-hitter by Art Fromme, but the Reds finally beat New York
and Mathewson, 2-0. Art Fletcher's single is the only safety. The Giants'
lead shrinks to 3 1/2 games over the Cubs.

Owen Wilson triples for his 3rd game in a row, a 4th-inning drive off Walter
Dickson good for 3 runs. Pittsburgh beats Boston, 9-4.

At Boston, Chicago White Sox infielders Rath and Weaver get thrown out
of the game, and coach Kid Gleason takes over at 2B. The 45-year-old last
appeared in a game 4 years ago, but he makes no errors and goes 1 for 2 at
the plate. With his appearance, Gleason has now played in four decades. The
two Sox knot at 8 runs apiece.

In response to demands for an alternative way to rate pitchers besides wins
and losses, the NL will officially keep ERA's for the first time. The Giants'
Jeff Tesreau will lead the league at 1.96. Despite an increase in .300
hitters from 22 to 32 this year, there will be 19 pitchers with ERA's under
3.00. The AL will not make ERA part of their official statistics until 1913.

1915
Mathewson wins his 8th and last game of the year edging the Pirates,
2-1. Babe Adams takes the loss.

Detroit snaps the Red Sox' win streak, stopping Boston, 7-6 in 12
innings. Boston still leads the AL by 4 1/2 games.

1917
In the 4th inning in New York, Pirates swiftie Max Carey beats out a bunt
single, and goes to 2B on a single by Tony Boekel. Both runners steal on
the next pitch from Rube Benton and, with Boekel entangled with New York
2B Buck Herzog, Carey steals home as well. Wilbur Cooper makes the one run
stand up for the 1-0 win. For Carey, it is his 13th steal of home enroute
to a NL record 33 steals of home.

At Detroit, Ty Cobb is 3 for 4 to lead the Tigers to a 5-1 win over the
Red Sox and lefty Babe Ruth.

1918
After today's doubleheader split with the Braves in Cincinnati, Christy
Mathewson resigns as Reds manager to accept a commission as a captain in
the chemical warfare branch of the Army. He leaves the team in 3rd place
with a 61-57 record. Heinie Groh takes over for the last 10 games of the
season, going 7-3.

Lefty George Mogridge saves the Yanks' 4-2 win in the opener against the
Browns, relieving Slim Love. LF Ham Hyatt connects for a Yankee HR in the 2nd
as New York scores all its runs in the first two innings. In the 2nd game,
the Browns start George Sisler on the mound. The Michigan Marvel pitches
the first 7 innings and is 3 for 5 with a 3-run HR before being relieved
by Byron Houck and returning to 1B. The Yanks prevail in 12 innings, 7-6,
with the victory going to reliever Mogridge, who bats in the winner. It is
Sisler's first start in 10 years, and the last of his career, and he would
"probably have pitched to victory had it not been for [Les] Nunamaker's
shaky substitution in the gateway corner" (NY Times). Nunamaker makes 3
errors at 1B before being banished to LF, but is 6 for 6 for the afternoon,
including 5 hits and an intentional walk in the nitecap.

The Red Sox' Bullet Joe Bush strikes out an AL-season high 13 Tigers,
including 8 in the first 3 innings, but loses, 2-1. Cobb and Ruth are
absent from their lineups, with Babe attending the funeral of his father,
who was killed by a blow from his brother-in-law.

At Pittsburgh, the Phils take advantage of shaky Pirate fielding to sweep
two from the host team, winning 7-6 and 11-2. Brad Hogg and Milt Watson
notch wins as Buc SS Luke Boone boots four on the afternoon, and 1B Bill
Hinchman adds two more errors.

1920
The first place White Sox lose to the Yankees, 6-5 in 12 innings, but
still lead the AL. Ruth is out of the Yank's lineup with a swollen arm from
chigger bites incurred while working off days as a star in the filming of
Safe At Home.

The Indians break out of their slump by scalping the A's, 15-3, on 21 hits.

At Chicago, the Cubs scratch out a 1-0 win over Brooklyn, with Pete Alexander
beating Burleigh Grimes.

The Giants knock the Reds out of 1st place, winning the first game of a
doubleheader in 17 innings, 6-4. Doyle's double scores Young and Kelly. The
score is tied at 4 each at the end of the 6th and starters Art Nehf and
Ray Fisher match zeros until the 17th. The 2nd game ends in a five-inning tie.

1921
The Bucs reel out of New York after dropping their fifth straight game to
the Giants as Art Nehf, pitching with 2 days rest, wins 3-1. The Giants
are just 2 1/2 games in back.

1922
The Yankees increase their lead by beating the Browns, 2-1, in 11 innings on
Meusel's sac fly. Hank Severeid's HR is the only score for the Browns. An
apparent 2-run double off the LF wall by Eddie Foster in the 10th is ruled
foul by Moriarty. The Yanks take the series, 3-1.

1925
The Braves get shut out for the 2nd game in a row. Pittsburgh's Vic Aldridge
wins, 1-0.

1926
Veteran P Dutch Ruether is picked up from Washington by the Yankees.

1927
Babe Ruth has a homer, off reliever Ernie Nevers, and a triple to pace the
Yankees to a 14-4 win over the Browns. Meusel and Combs also add homers.

Ted Lyons allows 4 hits and an unearned run as the White Sox beat Bump
Hadley and the Senators, 6-1. Lyons also leads the attack with 2 doubles
and a walk in 3 at-bats and scores 3 times. Nats SS Reeves sets an AL record
with 13 assists, a mark that will be tied by Alex Rodriguez in 1996. (Tommy
Corcoran, Reds, holds the ML mark of 14, set in 1903).

1929
Hornsby has 4 hits and Sheriff Blake allows 6 to lead the Cubs to a 4-1
win over the Reds. Chicago now leads by 14 1/2 games, the greatest lead a
NL team has enjoyed at this stage since the 1906 version of the Cubs.

1932
In the first of two games in Chicago, Kiki Cuyler hits a 3-run homer to lead
the Cubs to 6-1 win over the Giants. Cuyler adds two hits in the 2nd game
win, 5-0, the 9th win in a row for the rampaging Cubs. Burleigh Grimes and
Bob Smith each record complete-game wins for Chicago, now 5 games in front
of Brooklyn.

1933
In front of 60,000, the host Indians split a pair with the leading Senators,
fumbling away a 14-1 decision, then winning 6-3. The Tribe make nine errors
in the opener, led by Johnny Burnett at 3B and Bill Cissell at SS with
three apiece. Bob Boken and Joe Kuhel combine for 7 RBIs in the first game
as Earl Whitehill coasts. Bob Brown wins the nitecap over Alvin Crowder.

Pitching on two days rest, Guy Bush shuts out the Dodgers for the second
shutout in four days, as the Cubs win, 2-0. Bush, who shut out the Phils on
Thursday, allows just two hits in beating Van Lingle Mungo. Mark Koenig's
homer and score after a double make the difference. Ray Benge pitches
Brooklyn to a 5-2 win in the nitecap.

1934
At St. Louis, Cards pitcher Tex Carleton makes his second consecutive start
against the Dodgers and again Brooklyn beats him. Dazzy Vance relieves Tex
in the 5th as the Dodgers win, 10-1.

1935
The Yankees outslug the White Sox, 13-10, in the first game of two as the
two teams combine to strand 30 runners (15 apiece), tying the ML record set
in 1893. After 3 hits in the first game, Lou Gehrig ties an AL record with
5 walks in 5 plate appearances in the 2nd game, as the Yanks lose, 4-3.

The Browns sweep a pair from Washington, winning 10-6 and 11-1. In game 2
both Russ Van Atta and Bobo Newsom yield 9 hits, but Bobo walks 12 Browns,
hits another, and adds a wild pitch.

1936
The Pirates beat the Dodgers, 6-3. Losing pitcher Van Lingle Mungo is so
incensed by the four errors the Dodgers make that he leaves the team and
returns to Brooklyn. Dodger president Steve McKeeve calms the pitcher down
and he rejoins the team.

1937
At Ebbets Field, Fred Frankhouse of the Dodgers loses his chance to pitch a
full no-hitter when rain stops the game with 2 out in the 8th. The hitless
Reds lose 5-0.

The Dodgers put George Jeffcoat on the retired list. The pitcher had an
appendectomy last month and has failed to regain his strength. He'll make
it back to Brooklyn in 1939.

The Red Sox down the 2nd-place Tigers, 8-5, behind the pitching of Jack
Wilson. Jake Wade gives up six runs in the 7 innings for the loss. The Tigers
get on the board first when Rudy York poles a three-run homer - his 7th homer
in 7 games - in a four-run first. The only other score for the Motormen is
Gee Walker's 5th-inning homer. Joe Cronin and Eric McNair homer for Boston.

The Giants split a pair with the Pirates, losing the opener, 1-0, to Ed
Brandt and Mace Brown, then winning, 3-2, behind Al Smith. With the Cubs
rained out, the Giants fall two games back.

1938
With 40,959 fans at Yankee Stadium, Joe DiMaggio has 3 triples in the first
game of a doubleheader with Cleveland, an 8-7 Yankee win. New York scores 4
in the 9th, the last 2 coming around on DiMaggio's 3rd successive triple,
to win it. In the 2nd game, Yankee Monte Pearson tosses a no-hitter - the
first at Yankee Stadium - winning his 10th straight game, 13-0. He faces
just 27 batters (thanks to 2 DPs), striking out 7. The Yankees, playing
their 6th successive doubleheader, increase their AL lead to 12 games.

1941
Charlie Root uses his arm and then his bat, hitting a clutch single with
the sacks full in the Cubs' 3-run 9th inning, to win his 200th game. The
Braves get one back but the visiting Cubs win, 6-4. The 42-year-old Root
had taken over in the first inning from Ken Raffensberger. Root will win
one more and his 201 wins is the all-time Cub mark. He will also hold the
club record for games (605) and innings pitched (3137 1/3). Root is best
known for giving up Babe Ruth's 'called' homerun.

Pitching to Detroit leadoff hitter Tuck Stainback, Boston's Lefty Grove
pulls a muscle in his side and is out for a month. Wilson then relieves
and allows just 5 hits but loses to Gorsica, in relief of Newhouser, 6-3.

In a night game at Ebbets Field, Kirby Higbe outpitches the Reds' Johnny
Vander Meer to win, 4-2. Higbe walks and singles in his 1st 2 at-bats,
giving him 9 for 10 in his last 3 games. With 2 outs in the 4th, Ernie
Lombardi swipes 2nd ... it is his first steal, or attempted steal, since
August 10, 1937 when he also stole against the Dodgers' Mickey Owens.

1942
Brooklyn salvages a win, 4-1, to leave St. Louis with a 5 1/2 game lead.

1944

Gromek shuts out the Sox in game 2 and wins when Roy Cullenbine hits a HR
in the bottom of the 9th off Johnny Humphries.

The Red Sox sweep the A's, 8-5 and 7-2. In game 2, Boston manager Joe
Cronin calls every pitch in the first 6 innings with Russ Christopher on
the mound. His "fastball" and "curve" audibles are loud enough to be heard
in the stands.

A crowd of 43,634 at the Polo Grounds sees the Giants take a pair from the
Dodgers, 8-1 and 4-1. Mel Ott has a pair of 2-run homers in the opener.

1946
At an Owners' Meeting, a committee formed to study integration, which includes
Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, delivers its secretive report defending the covert
color barrier which exists in professional baseball. The absurd reasons given
to why blacks shouldn't be allowed to play in the big leagues include an
absence of skills due to inferior training and lack of fundamentals and the
need to respect Negro League contracts, but another lesser known motivation
may have been profit as revealed later in the report, "The Negro leagues rent
their parks in many cities from clubs in Organized Baseball (and) Club owners
in the major leagues are reluctant to give up revenues amounting to hundreds
of thousands of dollars every year" as well as the fear white fans would
be driven away if black players attracted more minorites to the ballpark.

Kirby Higbe tops the Cardinals, 7-3, to give Brooklyn a split of their series.

1948
Hank Majeski of the Athletics hits 6 doubles in a doubleheader against
the Browns, pacing the dogged A's to wins of 6-0 and 9-1. He is the 3rd
AL player to collect 6 long hits in an afternoon and just the 2nd to do
it in two regulation-length games. Hal McRae, on the same date in 1974,
will do it next in the AL.

Johnny Schmitz leads the Cubs to a 1-0 win over the first-place Braves
at Wrigley Field. Schmitz allows just 6 hits, including two triples, but
doubles and scores the game's only run in the bottom of the 9th. Johnny
Sain takes the loss.

For the second time in 4 days, the Phillies are beaten on a game-ending
homer by an opposing pitcher. Today, it is Pirate P Kirby Higbe who hits
a 9th-inning homer to win, 4-3.

1949
At Philadelphia, the Pirates use 5 Blue Jay errors and Ralph Kiner's 8th
homer in his last 14 games to beat the Phils, 8-2. Ernie Bonham is the
complete-game winner in his last appearance in the ML. Bonham will die
September 15th of complications from an emergency appendectomy.

Former Mexican Leaguers Max Lanier and Fred Martin drop their $2.5 million
suit against baseball.

1950
Yankee Allie Reynolds hurls a 2-hitter in a 2-1 win over the White Sox.

The Indians' Ray Boone and Clyde Vollmer of the Red Sox match grand
slams today. Boone's comes in the 7-run 3rd to give Bob Feller a 7-0
cushion. Vollmer's pinch slam against Al Benton in the Sox' 6-run 7th helps
Boston to an 11-9 win. It is the Red Sox 9th slam of the season.

1951
At Shibe Park, light-hitting reserve C Del Wilber of the Phillies hits 3
HRs in 3 at-bats to provide Ken Johnson with all his support. He is the
only player to have done this. The 32-year-old catcher will only hit a
total of 19 homers during his major league career. Johnson beats the Reds'
Ken Raffensberger, 3-0, in the nightcap after Jocko Thompson shuts out
Cincinnati, 2-0, in the first game. Wilber went back to the minors in 1949
to manage in the Texas League.

The two fine Italian arms of Branca and Furillo had a no-hitter running
for eight innings writes columnist Dick Young ... in the 3rd inning Ralph
Branca's no-hitter seems broken by a one-hop shot to RF by pitcher Mel
Queen, but Carl Furillo guns him out at first. Branca, pitching on 2 days
rest, finally gives up 2 Pirate hits in the 9th before winning, 5-0. In the
nitecap the Pirates jump on Erv Palica for 3 runs in the first inning and
hold on for a 5-3 win behind Bill Werle and Vern Law. Clyde McCullough is
the "Big Un" with a two-run double and a two-run homer. The Pirates continue
to be the only team with a season edge on the Dodgers.

The Giants win two more from the Cubs, including a 5-4 twelve-inning
complete-game victory for Larry Jansen. It is his 17th win. The Cubs
score in the top of the 12th, but the Giants score two off Dutch Leonard
to win. Behind Al Corwin's pitching and homers by Stanky and Irwin, the
Giants take the nitecap, 6-3.

1954
In an 11-0 White Sox win, Chicago 3B Cass Michaels has his skull fractured
by a pitch from the A's Marion Fricano. Michaels is sidelined the rest of
the year, and the injury will effectively end his 12-year ML career.

The Reds pull off a triple play in the 6th to stop a Pirate threat, and
Ted Kluszewski hits a HR in the 9th for the game winner, as the Reds win,
3-2. Kluszewski's homer comes off Max Surkont, the 6th time this year that
Klu has left the park against him ... this ties the ML record set by George
Kelly off Vic Aldridge in 1923 and tied by Ted Williams off Johnny Rigney
in 1941. No one else this century will match the mark. Big Klu starts a
streak of 17 straight games in which he scores a run.

In the championship game of the Little League WS, Schenectady, NY, defeats
Colton, CA, 7-5. Future NL Rookie of the Year, Cub 2B Ken Hubbs leads Colton,
while future major leaguers Jim Barbieri and Billy Connors stars for the
New Yorkers. This team later becomes the subject of a best-selling book by
Martin Ralbovsky, Destiny's Darlings.

1955
In his second big league start, bonus baby Sandy Koufax two-hits the Reds at
Ebbets Field, 7-0. Showing his future dominance of the 1960's, the southpaw
strikes out 14 Cincinnati batters. The 2-team total of 23 strikeouts ties
a record.

At Detroit, the Red Sox trail, 3-0, with 2 outs in the 9th when Ted Williams
drills a grand slam HR. The Sox win 4-3.

1956
Curt Roberts of Columbus (IL) hits 4 HRs in a row in a 7-inning 10-7 win
against the Havana Cubans. His third homerun is inside-the-park. Havana
wins the 2nd game, 5-2.

return to play it will be with 4 catchers and 2 pitchers in the lineup.

1958
Owner Cal Griffith says that the Senators will probably accept a good offer

them, Cincinnati rallies from a 5-1 deficit to a 6-5 first-game win over
Los Angeles. Gene Freese hits a 3-run homer in the 7th and Wally Post adds a
2-run double in the 8th. Rookie Ken Johnson is an 8-3 winner in the nightcap
as the Reds pummel Don Drysdale. The sweep gives the Reds a 3 1/2 game lead

1964
Joe Adcock belts his 300th career homerun, off Diego Segui, to pace the
Angels to a 7-1 victory over host Kansas City. Adcock is the 23rd player

is the loser, giving up 4 runs in 2+ innings.

1971

homers. Rodriguez hit one to start the streak.

1973

deep off Astros hurler Tom Griffin in New York's 4-2 win.

Hal McRae ties the ML record with 6 extra-base hits - 5 doubles and a HR -
as the Royals split a doubleheader with the Indians. Kansas City loses the
opener, 12-8, and wins the second game, 13-3. McRae has a HR and 3 doubles
in game one to drive in 6 runs. He adds 2 doubles in the nitecap. Rico Carty
has 4 hits for Cleveland in the first game while teammate Joe Lis homers in
each game. George Brett records an unusual strikeout in the 3rd inning of
game one when he fouls a ball off his foot and Catcher Dave Duncan throws
to 1B. Umpire Odom calls Brett out and when Brett argues too vehemently,
he is ejected. The umps confer and then decide to reverse the call at
first base, ruling it a foul ball. But the ejection stands. It is Odom's
second ejection of the game ... he had earlier tossed Kansas City coach
Bob Aspromonte for protesting that McRae interfered with Duncan on a throw
home. Umpire Phillips had ejected Cleveland coach Larry Doby from the dugout
on the same play. John Mayberry pinch hits for Brett and strikes out.

1975
At Candlestick Park, nearly half the outs in the Giants' 9-1 victory over
the Expos come via the strike out. John Montefusco, who goes the distance
to get the win, strikes out 14 Montreal batters, and the 'Count' and his
teammates reciprocate by whiffing 11 times, including the three times he
goes back to the dugout with a bat in his hands.

Craig Kusick gains the dubious distinction of being hit by a pitch three
times in one game, tying a major league record. The 11th-inning plunking
of the Twins' first baseman leads to the decisive run in the team's 1-0
victory over Milwaukee. Kusick also got hit once yesterday (though records
for consecutive games are not kept). This mark will be tied by Craig Biggio
in 2000. Bert Blyleven goes the distance for today's win.

1977
Rangers Toby Harrah and Bump Wills hit back-to-back inside-the-park HRs on
consecutive pitches off Ken Clay, highlighting an 8-2 win over the Yankees,
only the 2nd loss for New York in 14 games. It ties the ML mark and it is the
first time since 1946 that two batters have connected consecutively on IPHRs.

Dan Driessen and Johnny Bench hit back-to-back homers in the 9th inning to
give the Reds a 5-4 win over the Phils. Tug McGraw serves up both. Driessen's
homer is a line drive that hits the CF wall at Riverfront and rebounds

their heads instead as Matt Williams drives in a ML-record-tying 6 runs
in a 10-run 4th as the Indians beat California, 10-4. Williams has a 3-run

IPHR game-ender in Phillies history and the first since Bob Dernier did it
in 1989, also against the Giants. He's the 29th major-leaguer since 1900

David Vincent). Ed Vosberg (1-0) picks up his 1st win since 1997.

2004
The Astros jump on Cubs starter Kerry Wood, who lasts 4+ innings, and
continue against Kyle Farnsworth. The Astros' Roy Oswalt wins 15-7,

the batter's box; he plunked Barrett five days ago and he and Wood were
ejected. Kent Mercker later hits Oswalt. Carlos Beltran hits 2 homers,
and has now homered in each of his last 5 games. He also steals two bases,
matching Howard Johnson who hit 2 HRs and stole twice on July 11, 1987. Jeff
