1901
The Boston Americans coast to a 16-0 win over the A's behind the pitching
of Cy Young. It is Cy's 20th win of the year versus 5 losses.

1902
Brooklyn edges the visiting Reds, 2-1, as players Wild Bill Donovan and
Billy Maloney, acquired during the season from the Browns, do the umpiring
when the regular umps fail to appear.

1904
Pitcher Frank Owen of the Chicago White Sox, steals home against the Nats
in the 3rd inning of a 5-1 win.

Prompt action by Boston Americans players Bill Dinneen, Norwood Gibson, Freddy
Parent and Hobe Ferris prevents a tragedy in a Cleveland hotel. Returning
to their rooms following the game, the 4 are confronted by a fire sweeping
through the 5th floor. They extinguish the blaze and are toasted as heroes.

1905
The Athletics go into first place as Rube Waddell beats the White Sox, 4-3,
fanning 14. He will lead the AL with 287 strikeouts, the 4th of 6 straight
seasons when he tops the league.

At Pittsburgh, the Giants win their 13th game in a row, beating the Pirates,
3-1, to take a 10 1/2 game lead over the Pirates. Mathewson is the winner
over Deacon Phillippe. Bucs star Honus Wagner is thrown out at first in the
4th inning on a close play, then shows his displeasure by firing a ball
near umpire George Bausewine during warmups the next inning. Bausewine
responds by thumbing Honus out of the game. Wagner will be suspended for
3 games and fined $40.

1906
While the Athletics, crippled by injuries, falter, Doc White launches the
White Sox on a 19-game winning streak (longest in AL history) with a 3-0
win over Boston. The streak, interrupted only by a 0-0 tie with New York,
catapults Chicago from 4th place to first in 10 days. Doc White wins 6 of
the 19 and Ed Walsh, 7. In this century, the 'Hitless Wonders' streak will
only be equaled by the 1947 New York Yankees. Boston, too, starts a more
dubious streak of four straight shutout losses. They lose tomorrow, 4-0,
1-0 on the 4th, and 4-0 on the 6th. This ties the mark set earlier in the
year by the Boston Nationals, and no team will top them.

The Cubs shut out the Phillies twice, beating them 1-0 and 7-0. Reulbach
and Brown are the winners.

1907
Manager Hugh Jennings, known for his gyrations on the coaching lines and
"Eeyah" war cry, is suspended for 10 days for insisting on using a tin
whistle while coaching at 3B for the Tigers.

Walter Johnson, 19, debuts with Washington and loses to Detroit. The first
hit off him is a bunt single by Ty Cobb, who also helps Detroit's cause by
throwing out 3 runners from RF, two of them at home plate. Sam Crawford's
inside-the-park HR is the margin in Detroit's 3-2 win. Johnson exits in the
8th, trailing, 2-1. Detroit also wins the 2nd game of the doubleheader and
moves into first place.

Three Finger Brown tops Mathewson for the 3rd time this season, allowing
just 4 hits in shutting out the Giants, 5-0. The first-place Cubs paste
Matty for 9 hits, and will take 4 out of 5 games in the series with New York.

1909
Harry Pulliam is buried in Louisville. For the first time in history, both
NL and AL games are postponed in tribute. After the funeral, a special
meeting of the Board of Directors appoints John Heydler to succeed Pulliam.

1910
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants score 4 runs in the 1st off Orval Overall,
but Overall tightens his belt and allows no more scoring. The Cubs come
back with 5 runs off Mathewson to win, 5-4.

1911
Christy Mathewson allows 15 singles, but his teammates help with 4 double
plays and the Giants top the Pirates, 8-4. Babe Adams takes the loss.

Against visiting Brooklyn, King Cole throws a 10-inning 2-hit shutout to
give the Cubs a 1-0 win. Jimmy Archer's homer in the 10th off Nat Rucker
is the winner.

1913
It's Walter Johnson Day in Washington. President Wilson is on hand to help
mark the Big Train's 6th anniversary in a Senators uniform. Johnson is
presented with a silver cup filled with 10-dollar bills ($674) and returns
the favor with a 3-2 win over Detroit, his 24th win of the year.

The Federal League takes a big step toward another baseball war, voting to
expand into the East.

1915
On the 8th anniversary of Walter Johnson's debut, the Big Train tops the
Browns, 5-1. The losing pitcher is George Sisler, who has a single off
Johnson.

1916
Phils star Grover Alexander wins his 20th of the season, pitching a 12-inning
1-0 shutout over the Cubs. In the 12th, Alex intentionally walks two and
then fans pitcher Iron Mike Prendergast with the bases loaded. Bill Killefer
strolls home with the winning run while the Cubs are arguing a call at
third base. Alexander has now won more games than the cross-town A's (19).

1919
In New York, the Tigers beat the Yankees in 10 innings, 14-8. The big blow
in the extra frame is Harry Heilman's 2nd homer of the day, a grand slam,
which comes after an intentional walk to Veach. The two had hit homers in
the 8th on successive pitches. Heilman adds a pair of singles and Cobb has
4 hits and a walk. Roger Peckinpaugh paces New York with 3 hits, including
a homerun, and 4 RBIs.

In Chicago, the Phils sweep a pair from the Cubs, 2-1 and 4-3. The second game
was interupted by bottle-throwing as fans protest a call at 3B. After game,
several fans came onto the field after the umpires. Fred Luderus, Phils first
sacker, plays in his 479th straight game (started June 2, 1916), breaking
Eddie Collins record set in 1916. The Phillies first baseman will extend
his major league mark to 533 before the streak ends in the 1920 season opener.

The Braves trade 2B Buck Herzog to the Cubs for 2B Charlie Pick and OF
Les Mann.

1921
With the jurors lifting the men onto their shoulders, the eight White
Sox players accused of throwing the 1919 World Series are acquitted by
the jury. That night, jurors and defendants celebrate with a party in an
Italian restaurant. The next day, Commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis will
say the overwhelming evidence clearly shows the Black Sox fixed the games
with gamblers and all involved will be banned from playing professional
baseball again.

1922
Ken Williams homers in his sixth straight game setting an American League
record. The Browns left fielder's homerun helps beat the Red Sox, 9-4.

1923
The Browns drop a pair to the Senators, losing 5-0 to rookie Monroe Mitchell,
then losing 2-1 to George Mogridge. Mitchell will go just 2-4 in his only
ML season. The Browns help the recruit by twice batting out of turn (as
noted by Clifford Blau). In the first inning, Ken Williams hit in Jacobson's
place. Then, in the ninth, Hank Severeid batted when Gerber was supposed to,
and the latter was called out. Coincidently or not, the Browns will fire
manager Lee Fohl in a few days and replace him with Jimmy Austin.

1924
A's 1B Joe Hauser sets an AL record when he hits 3 HRs and a double for 14
total bases in a 12-4 win over host Cleveland. It'll be broken by Ty Cobb's
16 total bases on May 5, 1925. His first 2 HRs come off Joe Shaute in the
2nd and 3rd and his double in the 6th bounces off the screen in RF.

The Reds sweep a pair from the Braves, winning 2-0, then collecting 24 hits
to win 19-2.

1925
Walter Johnson, who has been ailing with the flu, recovers to give the
Senators a 5-1 win over the Tigers on the 18th anniversary of his first
appearance, also against the Tigers.

1926
In the Giants' 4-2 win over the Cards at the Polo Grounds, New York CF Ty
Tyson seals the victory with an unassisted DP in the 8th inning with the
bases loaded. Tyson was beaned in the 6th, but stays in the game and snags
a Specs Toporcer line drive and touches 2B before Tommy Thevenow can get back.

1927
Washington celebrates Walter Johnson Day on the 20th anniversary of
his joining the team. He receives $14,764.05, a silver service, and a
Distinguished Service Cross from the AL. The cross is made of gold with
20 diamonds. Billy Evans, who was behind the plate of Johnson's 1st game,
is there again, though on crutches. He leaves after calling the first
inning. The Tigers kayo Johnson in a 3-run 9th to win 7-6, the loss going
to reliever Garland Braxton. Under today's rules, the runners he inherited
(and the loss) would be charged to Johnson. Harry Heilmann, enroute to his
3rd batting crown, is 3 for 4 against Johnson.

1928
In St. Louis, the Browns go 15 innings with the Yankees before emerging
winners, 4-3. A tired starter Herb Pennock gives up the winning single
to pitcher Walter Stewart, who relieved for Curly Ogden. The loss leaves
the Yanks 4 1/2 games ahead of the A's ... New York had a 12-game lead on
July 4th.

The A's win their 10th straight, beating Cleveland, 6-0. The Mackmen have
now won 17 of 18 games. The winning pitcher is George Earnshaw, whom the
A's recently acquired from Baltimore.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants beat the Reds, 7-5, to move into 2nd
place. Joe Genewich is the winner, going all the way against 4 Reds pitchers.

The Pirates score 12 runs in the first 3 innings and coast to an 18-4 win
over the Phillies. Glenn Wright in the 2nd, and Larry Grantham in the 3rd,
clout 3-run homers.

1929
In the 9th inning at Philadelphia, 1B Don Hurst cracks his 6th HR in as
many games, a ML record up to this time. In the 6 games, Hurst had no other
hits. The Phils win 2-0 over Pittsburgh, with Les Sweetland allowing 11
hits in the shutout to beat Larry French.

At St. Louis, the Cards bomb Dazzy Vance for 18 hits and 13 runs in his
six-inning stint, before Uncle Robby mercifully removes him. As the Dazzler
leaves, the band plays, "the old grey mare ain't what she used to be." Six
of the blows are for extra bases, including Jim Bottomley's 24th homer, as
Sunny Jim knocks in 5 runs. Mitchell coasts home with the win for the Cards.

The A's spot the Tigers six runs in the first inning, then rally to win,
11-10. Harry Heilmann had 4 hits, including two homers, for the losers,
as did McManus and Alexander. The Tigers outhit the A's 13-10. The A's
victory increases their AL lead to 11 1/2 games over the Yankees, losers
today to the Indians, 9-8.

After being shutout four straight times by Giants hurler Fred Fitzsimmons,
the Reds score off him in the first inning and add two unearned runs
in the 3rd to win, 3-2. Freddie allows just four hits in losing to Pete
Donohue. Before the game, John McGraw issues a vehement denial that he has
hurt morale by browbeating his players and issuing fines for errors. He says
he has only fined Hubbell $25 for failing to touch second base in a game,
and Frank Hogan $50 for failing to show up at the team hotel in Boston one
night. "These, plus a fine of $100 assessed against Jack Cummings for being
absent without leave for ten days - during which I had no idea where he was
and could not even notify him of his transfer to the Braves - constitutes
the total fines I have ordered." He also states that he hasn't even been
in the clubhouse since July 18th.

1930
Playing under Kansas City's portable light system, the Pittsburgh (later
Homestead) Grays' 44-year-old hurler Smokey Joe Williams (27 strikeouts)
spins a one-hitter to defeat the Monarchs' Chet Brewer (19 strikeouts,
including 10 in a row starting in the 7th), 1-0, in a fiercely contested
12-inning matchup. Oscar Charleston scores the only run.

1931
The Red Sox and the third-place Yankees split a Sunday doubleheader before
a record 40,000 played at Braves Field because of religious restrictions
involving Fenway. Former Boston P Red Ruffing wins the first game, 4-1, and
ex-New Yorker Wilcy Moore blanks his former mates, 1-0, in the nightcap. Moore
allows just three singles in topping George Pipgras. The Yanks will go two
years and a day, a major league record spanning 308 games before being shut
out again.

Washington beats the A's, 10-6, to knock Philadelphia's lead in the AL down
to 14 games.

1932
The Cubs lose again in Brooklyn, 4-2, as Warneke gives up 3 runs in the 8th
inning, and now trail the Pirates by 5 games. Warneke loses his 2nd in the
series after winning 9 straight. Following the loss, Cubs president Veeck
and Hornsby argue on the train to Philadelphia about the strategy. Further
discussion in Veeck's hotel room ends with the firing of Rogers Hornsby as
a manager. A contributing factor in The Rajah's departure is his gambling,
and the debts he has run up borrowing money from Cubs players (Hornsby
said to pay debts). Veeck works out a repayment schedule with the money
to be subtracted from what the Cubs owe Hornsby on his contract. Affable
1B Charlie Grimm is put in charge of the team and the team will charge in
front winning 20 of their next 25 games.

1933
In a 16-3 win over the Yankees in New York, A's catcher Mickey Cochrane hits
for the cycle for the second time in his career. The Philadelphia backstop
also accomplished the rare feat last season. He's the only 20th-century
catcher to cycle twice.

The Tigers beat the White Sox, 3-2, as Hank Greenberg drives in all 3
runs. Vic Sorrell tops Ted Lyons.

1934
Walter Johnson is hospitalized with pleurisy, and Willie Kamm takes over
as interim Cleveland manager.

1935
Phillies 1B Dolph Camilli makes 3 errors in the first inning, a NL record, in
an 8-3 loss to the Dodgers. He will lead the NL in fielding, however, in 1937.

1936
In Detroit, Washington's Jesse Hill hits a 9th-inning triple and then steals
home to climax a 3-run rally in the 9th. The Senators win, 5-3. The Cards' Don
Gutteridge will duplicate Hill's effort on September 11th against the Dodgers.

In Cleveland, the Indians play their first game in three years at Municipal
Stadium and draw 65,000 fans to watch the Yankees and the Tribe battle to a
16-inning 4-4 tie. Darkness ends the game at 7:15. Cleveland catcher Frank
Pytlak will miss a month after being struck in the jaw with a Pearson pitch
in the 3rd inning. The pitch fractures his jaw. Gehrig is 3 for 6 before
leaving in the 14th inning for Jack Saltzgaver. Hal Trosky runs his hit
streak to 28 games but will be stopped tomorrow by Schoolboy Rowe. The game
is part of a promotion put on in conjunction with the nearby Great Lakes
Exposition. Prior to the game there are a number of contests including one
for pitching accuracy, won by 17-year-old Bob Feller.

After losing the opener, 9-1, at Comiskey Park, the Red Sox lead 10-1 after
4 1/2 innings of game 2, only to see Chicago roar back to win 12-11 in 12
innings. This is the biggest blown lead on the road in Red Sox history. Boston
chases Vern Kennedy and his 10-game win streak in the nitecap, but starter Wes
Ferrell gives up 5 runs in the 8th and 2 more in the 9th to tie. Jack Russell
and Ostermueller are the losing pitchers with Clint Brown and Chelini winning.

1938
Larry MacPhail has official baseballs dyed dandelion yellow, and they are
used in the first game of a doubleheader between the Dodgers and Cardinals
at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers win 6-2, but Johnny Mize hits one of Freddie
Fitzsimmons' knuckleballs for the first "yellow" HR. Fat Freddie complains
that the dye comes off and the balls are too slick. The Dodgers will use
up their yellow balls in 3 more games in 1939 (Cards over Dodgers, 12-0
and 5-2; Dodgers over Cubs, 10-4). In the 2nd game today, a white ball is
used and the Dodgers tattoo that for a 9-3 win. Yellow balls were used in
an August 1928 game between Milwaukee and Louisville.

Cubs P Clay Bryant, who will lead the NL in walks (125) and strikeouts
(135), shuts out the Giants, 7-0, at the Polo Grounds. Hubbell takes the loss.

Two players act as umpires in a game in St. Louis. In a game being worked
by only two umpires, Browns catcher Billy Sullivan tries to score on Orel
Hildebrand's single in the second inning, and smashes into umpire Harry
Geisel, knocking him cold. Geisel is carried from the field, and regains
consciousness in the clubhouse, where Dr. R. F. Hyland discovers that the
umpire's left wrist has been fractured. Steve Basil, the other umpire,
goes behind the plate while Buck Newsom (Browns) and Oscar Bluege (Nats),
both active players, became umpires in the field. Washington wins, 5-3.

1939
In the ninth inning of New York's 7-2 loss to Detroit, Joe DiMaggio makes
one of the most memorable catches in Yankee Stadium history when he grabs
Hank Greenberg's drive 455 feet from home plate. The 24-year-old center
fielder, who seldom displays emotion, is so thrilled with the amazing catch
he enthusiastically heads toward the dugout forgetting there is still a
man on base with only two outs, a rare mental error for the 'Yankee Clipper'.

1940
In Detroit, the Red Sox pound 14 hits in beating the Tigers, 12-9. Shortstop
Joe Cronin is 4 for 5 and hits for the cycle, the 5th cycle in Sox
history. Cronin cycled in 1929, not the first player to cycle twice, but
the first to do it a decade apart. His 8th-inning homer, off Archie McKain,
follows a Doc Cramer triple and ices it for the Sox. Boston also gets
homers from Dom DiMaggio and catcher Jimmy Foxx, his 23rd. Ted Williams,
pinch hitting in the 4th, draws a walk. Jack Wilson beats Tom Seats, with
both pitching in relief.

In San Antonio, a crowd of 11,956 is on hand to watch veteran Dizzy Dean pitch
for the Cubs affiliate Tulsa Oilers (Texas League) against the Missions. Dean
is rocked for 10 hits and 5 runs in 5 innings as the Mission hit seven
"crowd rule doubles" in the game. Bob Muncrief allows 11 hits but pitches
a 7-3 complete game for his 20th win.

1941
Marv Breuer shuts out the Browns on 3 hits to win, 2-0. It is the Yankees
3rd shutout in a row. Denny Galehouse gives up 8 hits, including a double
to DiMaggio. This extends DiMag's new hit streak to 16 games.

1942
Carl Hubbell wins his 5th straight, topping the Cardinals, 7-1. Mel Ott's 2
homers, one a grand slam, eases the way for the vet. In the nightcap, Dick
Bartell's 9th-inning error paved the way for Billy Southworth's squeeze bunt,
and the Cards win, 3-2. Mort Cooper allows 4 hits in winning his 13th.

The Braves split a pair with the Reds, winning the opener, 7-0, behind Al
Javery before being shot down by Paul Derringer, 4-2. Boston's top homerun
hitter, Max West hits a grand slam in game 1.

At Detroit, the Tigers sweep a pair from the Red Sox, 8-4 and 6-2, to knock
Boston out of 2nd place. Dizzy Trout wins the opener, helping himself with a
3-run HR. Virgil Trucks wins the nitecap, giving up a 9th-inning HR to Ted
Williams. Along with Jim Tabor, CF Dom DiMaggio has a homer in the opener,
then adds an unassisted DP in the nitecap.

At Yankee Stadium, Satchel Paige and Hilton Smith combine to pitch a one-hit
shutout over the New York Cubans (Negro League). The Monarchs win, 9-0. In
the first game of the twinbill, the Philadelphia Stars conquer the Baltimore
Elite Giants, 7-4. Henry Spearman's grand slam sparks the Philley attack.

1943
Yankee minor leaguer Larry Berra (the Yogi will come later), playing for
Norfolk, has 6 hits and 10 RBIs against Roanoke. This follows the 18-year-old
catcher's performance yesterday when he had 6 hits and 13 RBIs. For the
two games Berra has 12 hits, 23 RBIs, with 3 homers, two triples and a
double. For his other 109 games, Berra has just 4 homers and 33 RBIs. He
will hit .253 for the year and lead the league in errors.

1947
At Wrigley, the Cubs pummel 7 Dodger hurlers to win a second straight from
the Dodgers, 12-7. Peanuts Lowrey and Eddie Waitkus, the 1st two hitters
for Chicago, have 5 hits apiece.

The Giants hit 5 homers and set a club record of 144 in a split with the
Pirates. The Ottmen take the lidlifter, 10-2, then lose, 5-4. Bobby Thomson
has a pair of homers. The Pirates also tie a club record for homers with
86 as Greenberg and Gustine go deep.

1950
Andy Pafko of the Cubs hits 3 HRs in the 2nd game of a doubleheader, but
the Cubs lose both to the Giants, 11-1 and 8-6.

Larry Doby hits 3 HRs in a game as Cleveland beats Washington, 11-0. Besides
tossing the shutout, Indians hurler Bob Lemon hits a HR. Lemon has now won
9 in a row.

Elmer Valo hits for the cycle as the A's thrash the White Sox, 10-3.

1952
In Brooklyn, the Cubs' Hank Sauer hits a three-run homer in the third
inning off Ben Wade. The game is rained out in the fifth inning and Sauer
will end the season tied for the homerun lead with Ralph Kiner with 37.

1954
Johnny Antonelli (16-2) wins his 11th straight, beating the Reds, 9-4,
in the first game of a twinbill at the Polo Grounds.

The 55-game hitting streak of Waco (Big State) OF Roman Mejias ends. He batted
.435 during the streak (97 for 223) and will end the year at .354. The streak,
the 3rd longest ever in the minors, will earn him a promotion to the Pirates.

1955
Johnny Klippstein and Joe Nuxhall of the Redlegs shut out the Phils, 2-0 and
4-0, in both ends of a doubleheader. Klippstein allows 6 hits and Nuxhall just
5. Gus Bell knocks in both runs in the opener and 2 more runs in the 2nd game.

Mr. Cub Ernie Banks hits his 4th grand slam of the season, tying the ML
record, as Bob Rush bests the Pirates, 12-4.

1956
Boston's Jackie Jensen knocks in 9 runs as the Red Sox bag the Tigers
18-3. Jensen has a HR, a bases-loaded triple (he'll hit 3 triples with the
bases loaded this year), a single and a sac fly. He grounds out in the 8th
with the sacks full.

At the Polo Grounds, Reds OF Stan Palys has a homer and 4 singles as Cincy
beats the Giants, 10-3.

Herb Score shuts out the Yankees, 4-0, for the Indians 7th shutout in their
last 12 games. Bobby Avila gets the Tribe on board with an inside-the-park
homer in the 3rd. Ward and Colavito go back-to-back in the 4th and one out
later Chico Carrasquel homers. The 4 solo homers in a shutout win sets a
ML record.

1957
At Yankee Stadium, Cleveland's Don Mossi takes a no-hitter into the 7th
inning before McDougald and Mantle hit one-out back-to-back homers to tie
the game at 2 apiece. The Yanks score another run in the 8th and Bob Grim
saves the win for Tom Sturdivant.

1959
In the ninth inning of a 5-4 loss to the Boston Red Sox, Jim Bunning, tossing
a frame in relief, strikes out three batters on nine pitches sending Sammy
White, Jim Mahoney and Ike Delock back to the dugout with bats in their
hands. The Tiger right-hander becomes only the tenth pitcher in major
league history to accomplish the feat. The last AL hurler to K the side on
9 pitches was Lefty Grove, in 1928.

In the 2nd of two games at County Stadium, Billy Bruton of the Braves
hits 2 bases-loaded triples, tying a ML record, in an 11-5 win over the
Cardinals. Elmer Valo did it in the AL in 1949, and that mark will be tied
in 1978. The Cards win game 1, 4-3. Bruton hits a third triple in the game.

Giants 1B Willie McCovey hits the first of his 521 ML HRs, off Ron Kline,
as San Francisco downs the Pirates, 5-3. Johnny Antonelli wins his 15th game.

1960
In an agreement with the major leagues, the Continental League abandons
plans to join the AL and NL. Walter O'Malley, chairman of the NL Expansion
Committee, says, "We immediately will recommend expansion and that we
would like to do it in 1961." Braves owner Lou Perini proposes a compromise
that 4 of the CL territories be admitted to the current majors in orderly
expansion. Branch Rickey's group quickly accepts. The Continental League
ends without playing a game.

1961
New York beats Kansas City, 12-5, with Mantle walloping a first inning
homer off Art Ditmar. Mantle and Maris are both at 40 homers.

Juan Marichal fires a one-hitter - a Tommy Davis single - at the Dodgers,
winning, 6-0. Felipe Alou has 3 hits, including 2 HRs, to pace the Giants'
win over the league leaders.

1962
Phils P Art Mahaffey gives up 2 HRs to Frank Thomas and 2 more to Marv
Throneberry, but negates those with a grand slam of his own in the 3rd
inning. Mahaffey tops the Mets, 9-4, at New York.

1963
Vada Pinson hits a 3-run homer, off Don Cardwell, for the only scoring as
the 5th-place Reds beat the visiting Pirates. Jim Maloney is victorious.

Jimmy Schaffer.

1964
Detroit P Larry Sherry suffers a fractured left foot when struck by a
liner off the bat of Leon Wagner in Cleveland's doubleheader sweep, 6-1
and 2-1. Sherry is out for the rest of the year.

In Baltimore's 8-7 win over Kansas City, Brooks Robinson hits a ball that
strikes the LF pole at KC and it is ruled in play by John Rice. Brooks is
thrown out at 3B. Later Rice admits he made a mistake.

1965
Harmon Killebrew suffers a dislocated left elbow in a collision with
Baltimore's Russ Snyder. The Twins slugger will miss 48 games. Killebrew
is leading the AL in homers with 22 and RBIs with 70.

1966
Ossie Virgil drives in 3 runs and Juan Marichal, making his first relief
appearance of the year, picks up his 17th win, as the Giants edge the Mets,
5-4. The win moves the Giants (63-44) back ahead of the Dodgers and Pirates
by a game.

1967
With homers from both sides of the plate, Pete Rose leads the Reds to a 7-3
win over the Braves. It's the 2nd time Rose hits homers from both sides of
the plate in the same game.

1968
A day after he hit a grand slam against the Tigers, the Senators trade SS
Ron Hansen to the White Sox for IF Tim Cullen

1969
At St. Louis, the Cards take a 7-1 lead over the Dodgers, and stagger to
a 7-6 win. It's the Redbirds' 6th straight win and 13th in the last 15
games. Vada Pinson has a sac fly but no hits for the Cards, ending his
22-game hitting streak.

1970
Trailing by three runs entering the bottom of the ninth inning, the Phillies
score four times in the bottom of the frame without recording an out in
the unlikely 7-6 victory over the Giants. Tony Taylor ends the Connie Mack
Stadium contest with a walk-off grand slam off of Mike Davison.

Bobby Tolan celebrates his new son, born just before today's game, by
driving in the winning run in the 11th inning to beat the visiting Cubs, 4-3.

Oakland splits a pair with Washington, losing the opener, 6-2, but winning
game 2, 1-0, in the 9th when Don Mincher hits a game-ending HR off Horacio
Pena. Mudcat Grant, with one inning of relief, is the victor.

Carl Taylor ends a slugfest by belting a game-ending grand slam in the 9th
off Ron Herbel to give the Cards an 11-10 win over the Padres.

1971
Houston's Don Wilson allows just two hits in beating the Cubs and Fergie
Jenkins, 2-1.

Bill Lee pitches tremendous relief, allowing just 2 hits in 8 1/3 innings,
and the 2nd-place Red Sox come back to beat the AL East first-place Orioles,
7-4. The Birds get all their runs off Tiant in the 1st.
