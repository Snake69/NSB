1901
Before the Pirates' 6-3 win at Cincinnati, Reds and Pirates players are
clocked while running from home plate to 1B. The fastest time for the
90-foot sprint is 3 seconds flat, by Pirates OF Ginger Beaumont.

1905
The Highlanders field a unique battery:  Doc Newton pitching and Mike
"Doc" Powers catching, but only Powers is a physician. The Highlanders beat
St. Louis, 7-3.

At Boston, Harvard Eddie Grant makes his ML debut, collecting 3 hits for
Cleveland. But Boston wins, 7-5. Grant will go hitless tomorrow in an 8-4
loss to Cy Young, and be sent down to the minors. He'll resurface with the
Phillies in 1907.

1906
The Giants slow the Chicago express, stopping the Cubs, 7-4, behind Mathewson
and Hooks Wiltse. New York is just 4 1/2 games behind Chicago, but the Cubs
will go 50-8 from August 1st to outdistance the pack.

1907
Light-hitting Pat Moran bangs his only homer of the year, in the 12th inning,
to give the Chicago Cubs a 2-1 win over the New York Giants.

1908
In Brooklyn, the last-place Cardinals blank the Brooklyn Superbas (Dodgers),
3-0. The entire Washington Park contest is played with just one ball.

The Giants take 2 from Cincinnati, winning 4-3 in 12 innings, and 4-1. Christy
Mathewson wins both, relieving McGinnity in the 9th inning of the opener
and tossing nine innings in the nitecap. Andy Coakley loses both. New
York moves into 2nd place, 5 percentage points behind the Pirates. Despite
the two losses, it is a relief for the Reds to score runs. Cincy (48-50)
had endured four straight shutout losses: 5-0 on July 30, 3-0 on the 31st,
6-0 on the 1st and 3rd.

In a 7-5 loss to Cleveland, Senators Otis Clymer and Jim Delahanty draw
indefinite suspensions for abusing umpire Silk O'Loughlin. Delahanty, a
Cleveland native, is fined $50 by Ban Johnson and barred from the Cleveland
ballpark for one year for his unbecoming conduct, though he denies that
the language he used could be heard all over the park. Washington manager
Joe Cantillon then declares that he will not put the other contenders at an
unfair advantage and he benches Delahanty for games in Detroit, St. Louis
and Chicago. Delahanty will miss an additional 13 games because of this
but the ban will be lifted at the beginning of the 1909 season.

1910
Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia A's and White Sox hurler Ed Walsh duel one
another in a 16-inning scoreless tie.

Athletics Jack Coombs and Chicago's Ed Walsh duel 16 innings to a 0-0
tie. Coombs gives up just 3 hits and strikes out 18 in what he calls his
best game. Working with little rest, Coombs wins 18 of 19 starts in July,
August and September, finishing 31-9 with a 1.30 ERA. His 13 shutouts
are the AL record ... in 12 other games he gives up just one run. Walsh
gives up just 6 hits in 16 innings but the woeful Sox offense provides no
support. Coombs ties his AL mark for most strikeouts in a game set September
1, 1906, in 24 innings.

1911
The A's move into first place in the AL by taking a pair from the Browns,
5-1 and 5-2. The Athletics are 14-0 over St. Louis this season. In game 1
Stuffy McInniss has 18 putouts at 1B.

At Washington, the Senators sweep the White Sox, winning 1-0 in 11 innings,
then winning 3-2 in regulation. Doc White and Walter Johnson go all the way
in the opener. The Sox almost score in the 7th but Rollie Zeider is called
out at home and severly twists his ankle in the attempt. In the 9th Milan
doubles, and Germany Schaefer bunts him to 3B and is safe at 1B. Germany
steals 2B and after Elbefeld pops out, and Walker is at-bat, Germany steals
first base. Manager Duffy then comes onto the field to argue that Schaefer
should be out for stealing 1B, and while the argument goes on Germany takes
off for 2B, getting caught in a rundown. Milan then attempts to score and
is thrown out at home. The Senators then protest, to ump Connolly, saying
the Sox have ten men on the field, but it falls on deaf ears. The game is
marked by spectacular fielding including Lee Tannehill of the White Sox
setting a ML mark as the only SS to execute 2 unassisted double plays in
one game, though it is not even mentioned in the Chicago Tribune writeup.

1913
George Cutshaw celebrates the holiday by lining 2 inside-the-park homers
as Brooklyn beats the visiting Cubs, 7-1.

1914
Red Sox owner Lannin offers the use of Fenway Park to Braves owner James
Gaffney. With the Braves making a run for the pennant, Gaffney will take
up the offer.

1915
On a cold and damp day in St. Louis, the Giants sweep the Cardinals. In
the opener, New York pounds Red Ames and Mathewson coasts to a 10-0 lead
after 6 innings, but the Cards come back to make it close, losing 11-9. Jeff
Tesreau saves Matty's 6th win of the year. New York takes the nitecap, 7-0.

1916
The Browns' Eddie Plank allows 2 hits and tops young Babe Ruth to give the
Browns a 6-1 win over the first place Red Sox. For the hot St. Louis Browns,
it is their 14th win in a row, but the streak still leaves them in 7th place.

1918
In the nitecap at Detroit, Walter Johnson goes 17 1/3 innings, his 2nd longest
outing ever, and faces 64 batters in losing to the Tigers, 7-6. Detroit
collects 16 hits and 8 walks against the Senators' ace. Detroit ties the
score, 6-6, in the 7th inning when Ty Cobb drives in a run, and wins it in
the 18th on a Cobb double. Cobb, in CF, also throws out Milan at home in the
13th, while SS Donie Bush nails two Nats at home in the 14th. Hooks Dauss
is the winner with 10 innings of relief. In the first game, the Senators
score 6 runs in the 1st three innings off rookie Rudy Kallio and coast,
7-0, behind Doc Ayers. Ayers scatters 7 hits and shuts out Cobb. Johnson
is now 1-1 in 18-inning games this year!

In Chicago, the Sox sweep two from the A's, winning 7-6 and 3-2 in 10
innings. Dave Danforth goes 7 innings in the opener and, though lifted
with the score 2-2, is credited with the win over Willie Adams, who goes
all the way. Ed Cicotte is the victor in the nitecap.

In Cleveland, the Indians split with the league-leading Red Sox, to take
three out of four in the series. The Sox win the opener, 2-1 in 12 innings,
with starter Babe Ruth going the distance and allowing just 4 hits. Ruth
drives in the first run with a single, and the Tribe ties the game in the
8th with two hits. Cleveland takes the nitecap, 2-0, in a game called after
6 innings because of rain. Ruth, playing LF, has one hit and is hit once
by winner Stanley Coveleskie.

1919
The Red Sox release pitcher Ray Caldwell and he will sign with Cleveland.

1921
At Chicago, Braves Billy Southworth leads Boston to a 13-5 scalping of
the Cubs by belting 3 doubles and HR. John Watson coasts to the win over
Percy Jones.

1922
The Cards pass New York and move into first again, as the Cubs score a 3-2
win over the Giants, scoring 3 runs in the 9th inning. The Giants split
for the afternoon, winning the 2nd game of the doubleheader, 2-1.

1923
Travis Jackson drives in 8 runs on 4 hits to lead the Giants to a 14-4 win
over Cincinnati.

1924
Young Ernie Wingard wins his 13th game for the Browns, beating Washington
and Firpo Marberry, 3-1. This is Wingard's first pro season and not until
Jim Abbott wins 12 in 1989 will anyone come close to winning that many ML
games in his first pro year. Wingard will not improve on his 13, losing
his next 8 decisions this season to finish 13-12.

1925
Every player in each team's lineup has at least one putout in the
Indians-Yankees game. New York wins, 4-1, behind Urban Shocker.

1926
Stanford star fullback Ernie Nevers pitches his first complete game for the
St. Louis Browns, beating the A's 3-1. Nevers will be 6-12 in his brief
baseball life, but he will win a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame
playing with the Duluth Eskimos and Chicago Cardinals (1926-31).

At Chicago, Bill Barrett hits a grand slam in the 7th to break a 3-3 tie with
the Red Sox and give the White Sox a 7-3 win. He also hits a 2-run double.

Cardinal pitcher Willie Sherdel, who owns the Robins, continues his mastery
over Brooklyn with an 8-4 win. Sherdel paces the attack with a double,
triple and homerun.

The Braves and Pirates split, with Boston taking the opener, 14-0, and the
Pirates fighting back to win game 2 by a 5-2 score. Jack Smith has 8 hits
for the afternoon, including 5 hits in game 1.

1928
In New York, the Giants sweep a doubleheader from the Reds, outscoring Cincy,
13-11 and 10-9. New York collects 18 hits in the opener and 20 in the nitecap,
one more than the Reds. It is so hot on the field that Reds C Val Picinich
plays the 2nd game without a chest protector. Hughie Critz has a bunt single
in the opener and a double in game 2 to run his hit streak to 23 games.

The Braves split with the front-running Cards, losing 3-2 before beating
Pete Alexander, 2-1. The Cards only score in the nitecap is Jim Bottomley's
24th HR tying him for the NL lead with Hack Wilson.

At St. Louis, George Pipgras pitches the Yankees to an 8-6 10 inning win
over the Browns. Ruth clouts his 43rd homer. Gehrig is 2nd in the AL with
19, and Joe Hauser 3rd with 15.

1929
The Yankees take the opening game of 2 from the visiting Cleveland Indians,
winning 12-0. Tom Zachary wins his 7th straight. In the 2nd game, after
trailing 6-5 with 2 out in the top of the 9th, Cleveland scores an AL
record-tying 9 runs, to win 14-6.

1930
At Philadelphia, Lefty Grove helps himself to his 17th win by belting a
3-run homer in the 2nd. Al Simmons adds two triples and a 2-run homer as
the A's beat Boston, 13-4.

At Detroit, Charley Gehringer hits a CF homer with the bases loaded in the
12th inning to give the Tigers a 7-3 win over Chicago. It was Gehringer's 4th
hit and 2nd homer as he drives in 6 runs. It is Gehringer's 2nd 12th-inning
homer in a month ... he hit one against Cleveland on July 4.

1931
Pittsburgh's Heine Meine gives up 3 Cardinal runs in the 6th inning,
halting a scoreless streak by Buc hurlers at 45 innings. The Pirates streak
includes shutouts over New York and Cincy in 4 consecutive games. The Cards
win today, 7-1.

The Reds finally score, but lose to the Cubs, 4-2, in the first of two. Guy
Bush beats Larry Benton. Chicago takes the nitecap, 7-3, behind Les Sweetland
as Jack Ogden is pinned with the loss. Rookie OF Vince Barton has 5 hits
in the 2 games, including a pair of homers in game 2.

1932
After being fined $1,000 and suspended until Carl Reynolds, the player whose
jaw he broke in two places a month ago was ready to play again for the
Senators, Bill Dickey returns to the Yankees line-up. The future Hall of
Fame catcher bangs out four hits, including a grand slam, despite missing
31 games. New York beats Chicago, 15-3. Dickey will hit another grand slam
September 10th.

1934
After the Phillies take the first game, 5-4, Phillies P Reggie Grabowski
surrenders 11 hits (10 singles) in the 9th inning of the 2nd game against the
Giants for a modern NL record - but doesn't even lose the game. Roy Hansen
takes the loss. Eleven runs score in the inning, as New York wins 21-4. Mel
Ott scores 6 of the runs, the 1st 20th century player to do so. He will do
it again in 1944. Ott has a walk, HBP, two homers, a double and single to
drive in 4 runs.

Backed by Babe Ruth's 18th homer with 2 on and a 2-run homer by Jack
Saltgaver, the Yankees beat the A's, 5-1. Jimmy DeShong wins his 5th
straight. Gehrig is 0 for 2, striking out for the first time since July
16. In the same period, he's hit 11 homers.

Go figure. General Crowder, the AL's top winner in 1932 and 1933 is waived to
the Tigers by the Senators. Just 4-10 this year with the Senators, the General
will go 5-1 in Detroit for the remainder of the season, then win 16 next year.

1935
Cleveland president Alva Bradley announces the "Voluntary resignation" of
Walter Johnson as Cleveland manager. Walter Johnson (46-48) is replaced by
Steve O'Neill (36-23). The Tribe has dropped 23 of its last 32 decisions.

In Cincinnati, the Cubs take a 1-0 lead into the 8th inning behind Lon
Warneke, but a Bill Jurges error opens the way for five runs and a Reds
win. In the nitecap, catcher Wally Stephenson, making his first start above
D ball, collects three hits and drives home the winner in a 4-3 Cubs victory.

1936
The Cardinals regain first place, beating the Cubs, 6-1, and dropping them
to 2nd place. Roy Parmalee will stop the Bruins tomorrow, 4-1.

1937
Joe Medwick again ties the ML record with 4 extra base hits - all doubles
- in a game. It is the 2nd time this year, and the 3rd time altogether,
he has had 4 extra base hits in a game. The Cards rally for 5 runs in the
9th to edge the Boston Bees, 7-6.

Gabby Hartnett is 2 for 3 to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, but
the host Cubs lose, 2-1, to the Phillies.

After six straight losses, Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane inserts young
Rudy York into the starting lineup. York responds with a three-run homer
off Harry Kelley to start one of the most productive months in major league
history. The Tigers win, 11-7, over the A's.

Bill Dickey hits a grand slam for the 2nd consecutive game, connecting off
the Browns' Vern Kennedy in the 3rd inning. The Yanks need it all as they
edge St. Louis, 10-9. Dickey is the second American Leaguer to hit grand
slams in consecutive games ... Ruth did it twice.

1939
Mike Kreevich of the Chicago White Sox equals the ML record by grounding
into 3 successive DPs against the Washington Senators. Chicago loses, 6-5.

1940
Jimmie Foxx, who started as a catcher in 1925, is behind the plate for the
Red Sox to catch a 7-3 win for long-time teammate Lefty Grove. Foxx cracks his
24th HR to start the Sox on an 8-game skein in which they will hit 20 homers.

In Boston, the two teams dedicate the game in memory of Willard
Hershberger. Then Frank McCormick drives in 6 runs to lead the Reds to a
12-9 win over the Braves after Bucky Walters loses the opener, 5-3, for
his 3rd straight defeat.

1941
At Ebbets Field in the 3rd inning, C Mickey Owens catches 3 foul flies,
the first time in the ML that feat's been recorded. His Dodgers score 9
runs in the 6th and 7th to whip the Giants, 11-6.

1942
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants-Dodgers game ends in a 1-1 tie as Pee Wee
Reese's grand slam in the top of the 9th is wiped out. As was the case the
day before, the game is called because of the government's 9:14 curfew
on lights. It is the last twilight game played at the Polo Grounds. The
Dodgers have held the NL lead for 144 days. The margin over the Cardinals
is 10 games. Until the season's end, Brooklyn will win 17, lose 18.

Braves pitcher Jim Tobin clubs his 6th homer of the year, tying the NL
record for homers by a pitcher, but he loses to the Phils, 4-2.

1944
In Philadelphia, 29,166 ignore a transit strike and jam Shibe Park to help
Connie Mack celebrate his 50th anniversary as manager of the A's. Even
the Yankees' 1-0 win doesn't diminish the enthusiasm of the evening. Mack
receives a check for $5,000 as well as other gifts. On hand are members
of Connie Mack's All-Time All-Star team, each of whom he called to the
center of the diamond. These include George Sisler, Eddie Collins, Frank
Baker, Honus Wagner, Lt. Bill Dickey, Lefty Grove (introduced by Mack as
"Groves"), Walter Johnson, Tris Speaker, Babe Ruth and Al Simmons. Ty
Cobb and Lt. Commander Mickey Cochrane, two members of Mack's club, did
not appear. In the pre-game Abbott and Costello dressed in uniforms of the
A's and Yankees respectively, take batting practice. The Yankees score on
a fumble in the 9th to beat Bob Newsom. Hank Borowy wins his 14th.

Despite homers by Ron Northey and Jimmy Wasdell, the Phils lose, 4-3, to the
Giants in 10 innings. Starter Ken Raffensberger serves up a game-winning
homer to Hal Luby, and the 4th place Giants win their 10th in a row over
the Quakers.

At Brooklyn, former AL outfielder Ben Chapman makes his comeback debut as
pitcher a successful one, beating the Braves, 9-4. He yields 8 hits while
walking 5 and striking out 5 in the complete-game win. He adds 2 hits,
3 RBIs and 3 runs scored.

1945
Tom McBride of the Boston Red Sox drives in a ML-record-tying 6 runs in
the 4th inning of the 2nd game of a doubleheader against the Senators, as
the Sox score 12 runs. He doubles and triples off Santiago Ullrich and Joe
Cleary, each time with the bases loaded. The Sox bat around against Cleary,
who gives up 7 runs on 5 hits and 3 walks. Cleary, the last major leaguer
born in Ireland, gets one out, on a strikeout, but this is his only ML
appearance and he'll finish with a 189.0 ERA. The Senators then call on
Bert Shepard, who remarkably pitches 5 1/3 innings giving up one run on 3
hits. For Shepard, who was wounded in WW2 and lost a leg, this too will be
his only major league appearance. The Sox win, 15-4.

At Crosley Field, the Reds edge the Cubs, 4-3, behind the pitching of Ed
Heusser. It is Cincy's only victory against Chicago this year as they will
go 1-21 against the Cubs. Only the Cubs (1909 vs. Braves) are close with
a 1-20 mark. The Yankees (1927 vs. Browns) and the Pirates (1937 vs. Reds)
have matched this. No team has been swept in a season series.

At Pittsburgh, Pirate catcher Bill Salkeld is 5 for 5, including hitting
for the cycle, and drives in all 5 runs, but his Bucs lose 6-5 to the
Cardinals' reliever Harry Brecheen. Salkeld hits his only triple of the
year in the cycle, half his career total. His offensive effort offsets a
curious defensive stat ... he has no putouts or assists in the game.

1946
Bobby Doerr leads the Red Sox offense with 7 RBIs as Boston beats the host
Tigers, 9-4. Four of the runs come on a grand slam.

The Browns win a pair from the Athletics as Tom Ferrick picks up both
wins in relief, 8-7 and 7-4. He goes an inning in game 1 and 2 2/3 more in
the nitecap.

1947
The Yankees sell P Al Lyons to Pittsburgh.

1948
In St. Louis, the Browns spot the Red Sox 6 runs in the first inning, then
come back with 7 of their own in the bottom of the inning. St. Louis scores
2 in the 9th off reliever Ellis Kinder to win, 9-8.

Ernie Harwell, filling in for Red Barber who is recovering from a bleeding
ulcer, begins as an announcer for the Dodgers helping to call a 5-4 win
over the Cubs. The Dodgers had to trade a player, Cliff Dapper, to the
Atlanta Crackers to acquire Harwell. Brooklyn scores a pair in the 1st,
one on a steal of home by Robinson with Russ Meyer on the mound. Robby
tried to steal home against the Cubs 2 weeks ago (7/21) but was called out.

1949
Four years after appearing for the Senators, Bert Shepard is fired as
player-manager of Waterbury (Class B Colonial League) because the owners
can no longer afford his $4000+ salary. Shepard pitched for the Senators
wearing an artificial leg, having lost his leg in WW2. The players threaten to
strike unless he is rehired, then raise enough money to cover his salary. The
popular Shepard will return on the 11th. Shepard plays in 69 games at first
or pitching and posts a 5-6 record along with a .229 batting average. And
he adds 5 stolen bases.

At Swayne Field in Toledo, Mud Hen pitcher Walter Noble holds Minneapolis (AA)
hitless for 8 innings, after teammate Hal White pitched 9 innings of no-hit
ball yesterday against the Millers. He gave up a leadoff single. Noble wins,
2-0, in the scheduled 7-inning game. The 17 hitless innings is an American
Association record.

1953
Yankees hurler Vic Raschi sets the ML record for RBIs by a pitcher with
7 as the Yanks roll over Detroit 15-0. Raschi singles in 2 in the 2nd,
doubles home 3 in the 3rd and singles home the last 2 in the 8th. Four
pitchers held the mark of 6 ribbies. His record will stand in the AL, but
Braves pitcher Tony Cloninger will top Raschi's mark. Vic's teammates fill
his locker with bats after the game.

1955
Ernie Banks continues his hot hitting, clouting 3 HRs at Wrigley against 3
Pirate pitchers (Dinoso, Surkont and Littlefield) and they are all needed,
as the Cubs win 11-10.

1956
Al Kaline drives in all 5 Detroit runs on 2 homers to lead the Tigers to
a 5-4 win over New York. Mantle hits two homers against Virgil Trucks,
and scores another on a single in a losing cause.

1957
For the second consecutive game, Willie Mays hits two homers, and adds a
triple, as the Giants down the Cincinnati Reds, 7-6, in 14 innings. Ray
Katt's DP grounder in the 14th scores the go ahead run. Mays' second homer
of the game comes in the 12th inning, but Reds catcher Ed Bailey matches
him. Frank Robinson and Wally Post hit back-to-back homers in the 5th. The
Reds take the second game of the doubleheader, 3-2.

1960
Believing that Chicago's Jim Brewer is throwing at him, the Reds' 2B
Billy Martin throws his bat toward the mound. Then, advancing to retrieve
it from Brewer, who has picked it up. The two exchange words and Martin
launches a hard overhand right that fractures the orbital bone of Brewer's
right eye. Both benches empty and Martin continues swinging, decking Frank
Thomas. Brewer requires surgery and will be out of action for a month. The
Cubs win, 5-3, on Ernie Banks' homer at Wrigley. Martin will be fined $500 for
the punch and Brewer and the Cubs will sue the combative infielder on August
22nd for $1,000,000. Years later, when the courts award Brewer $100,000,
Martin's comment will be, "How can they ever collect it? I haven't got that
kind of money."

1961
With a little help from George Altman, the Cubs' Bob Anderson outpitches
Sandy Koufax, and beats the Dodgers, 4-2. Altman hits two homers off Koufax,
the first time anyone has done that off the Dodgers lefty.

At Candlestick, Warren Spahn wins his 299th game, 2-1, over the Giants. He
gets a bit of help from Hank Aaron who leads off the 7th and 9th with homers
off Mike McCormick. The Giants scoring is a Cepeda homer in the 5th.

1962
After a double header loss to the Mets, 9-1 and 3-2 in 13 innings at the
Polo Grounds, Reds manager Fred Hutchinson stays in the dugout instead of
joining his players in the club house. He then calls the clubhouse and
tells the players to be out of there in 15 minutes. They do. Hutch has
tickets for Zero Mostel's "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"
but doesn't use them.

At Visalia (California League), Visalia's William Dawson sets a league
record, striking out 21 Silver Sox batters. Visalia beats Reno, 7-4.

1963
At County Stadium, Roger Craig suffers his 20th loss of the season when
the Mets lose to Milwaukee, 2-1. The defeat is the right-hander's 18th
consecutive setback, tying Cliff Curtis' National League mark set in 1910 with
the Braves, and one loss shy of A's Jack Nabors' 1916 major league record.

After missing 61 games with a broken left foot, Mantle returns to the Yankee
lineup as a pinch hitter for Steve Hamilton. The Orioles are leading 10-9
in the 7th inning, when the stiff-legged Mantle golfs a line drive homer
to tie the game at 10. The emotional Yankees win it, 11-10, after the O's
take the opener, 7-2.

Dodger P Johnny Podres' bid for a no hitter is broken up with one out in
the 9th inning by Johnny Temple who singles. Podres ends with a one-hit
4-0 win over Houston.

Fred Hutchinson returns to manage the Reds. They respond by sweeping a pair,
5-2 and 4-2, from the Braves.

weekly telecasts.

1968
The Yankees, once again, honor their aging superstar when the team hosts
the second of three Mickey Mantle Days at the ballpark in the Bronx. Prior
to the game, over 2000 young fans paid tribute to the future Hall of Fame
outfielder by parading across the field with homemade banners expressing
their admiration for the living legend.

In pre-game ceremonies at Busch Stadium honoring him, Stan Musial is joined by
his 1941 Cardinal teammates. A 10-foot bronze statue of Musial is unveiled
at one of the Stadium entrances. The crowd of 47,445 then watch as Bob
Gibson battles the Cubs for 12 innings before Chicago P Lee Elia singles

Tom Walker of Fort Worth (Texas League) pitches a 15-inning 1-0 no-hit
win over Albuquerque, the 2nd longest no-hitter in baseball history.
The right-hander faces only 47 batters during the minor league game, two
over the minimum. The Dukes' Tom Haller matches Walker, scattering 9 hits
in 14 innings before exiting. Enos Cabell's run-scoring double ends it. Only
Fred Toney's 17-inning no-hitter in 1909 is longer.

1972
The Angels beat the Royals, 4-3, in 10 innings. Vada Pinson shows the way
home with 5 hits and 3 RBIs.

Colborn (14-7) is the winner.

In an outstanding relief performance, Yankee Lindy McDaniel comes to the
rescue of Fritz Peterson, who exits with a muscle pull in the 2nd inning,
and allows just one run in 13 innings to earn a 3-2 victory over the
Tigers. Horace Clarke's HR is the game winner.

1975
At Fenway, 35,866 are on hand to watch the Orioles topple the Red Sox,

modern ML records with 4 wild pitches in one inning (5th) and 6 in one game.

At the Kingdome, the Mariner's Ruppert Jones hits a foul ball that sticks
in the speaker above the 1B dugout. But the Athletics amass 11 hits fair
to beat the Mariners, 5-3. Dwayne Murphy is 3 for 3 with a triple and a homer.

1980
The Seattle Mariners fire manager Darrell Johnson and replace him with
Maury Wills, who becomes the 3rd black manager in ML history. Seattle had
lost 9 games in a row and 20 of 24 since the All-Star break. This is the
first managerial change in franchise history. The M's will fare no better
finishing the season 44 games under .500.

The Reds score 8 runs in the 7th enroute to a 11-2 win over the San Diego
Padres.

1982
OF Joel Youngblood becomes the first ML player ever to play for 2 different
teams in 2 different cities on the same day, and collects a hit in each
game. After going 1 for 2 off Fergie Jenkins in an afternoon game at
Wrigley Field, a 7-4 Mets win with Youngblood driving in the winning run,
he is traded from the Mets to the Expos and flies to Philadelphia in time
to enter the game that night in the 6th inning, going 1 for 1 off another
Hall of Famer, Steve Carlton. The Phils beat the Expos, 5-4.

1983
While warming up before the 5th inning of the Yankees' 3-1 win over the
Blue Jays game at Toronto's Exhibition Stadium, New York OF Dave Winfield
accidentally kills a seagull with a thrown ball. After the game, Winfield
is brought to the Ontario Provincial Police station on charges of cruelty
to animals and is forced to post a $500 bond before being released. The
charges will be dropped the following day.

1984
In a 9-2 Giants rout of the Astros, Jeffrey Leonard collects five hits. The
cleanup slugger gets all singles and, therefore, is unable to demonstrate
his one-flap-down homerun trot in front of the Houston fans at the Astrodome.

The Yankees win their 8th straight, 4-0, over the Indians on Lou Piniella
Day at Yankee Stadium. Sweet Lou played his final game less than two months
ago in an 8-3 win over the Orioles. Ray Fontenot allows one hit in 5 2/3
innings for the win, and Brian Dayett has a double and 2 RBIs. Victor Mata
hits his lone career homer.

1985
At Yankee Stadium with 54,032 New Yorkers cheering him on, White Sox Tom
Seaver becomes the 17th player in major league history to record his 300th
victory when he six-hits the Bronx Bombers, 4-1. All of the Yankees' hits
are singles. Before the game, the Yankees honor Phil Rizzuto by retiring
their former player and current broadcaster's uniform #10. The 'Scooter',
known for the expression 'Holy Cow', is knocked over in a pre-game ceremony
by a fitting gift from the team, a cow wearing a halo.

Rod Carew of the Angels bloops a single to left off of Twin Frank Viola
in the third inning to become the 16th major leaguer to amass 3000 hits.
The Angels beat the Twins, 6-5.

At Chicago, Doc Gooden wins his 11th straight, a club record, as the Mets
beat the Cubs, 4-1. Doc triggers a 3-run 3rd with a double.

1986
White Sox pitcher Jose DeLeon (2-0) beats Boston's Roger Clemens (17-4)
for the 2nd time in 5 days, 1-0, at Fenway Park. DeLeon and the White Sox
also won, 7-2, on July 30th.

1987
In the fourth match up of 300-game winners since 1900, Angels hurler Don
Sutton (317) allows four hits in six innings to beat Steve Carlton (328)
and the Twins, 12-3. The 645 combined victories is the largest number of
wins ever accumulated by pitchers starting the same major league game.

1988
Seattle John Rabb is suspended indefinitely for "failing to comply with
the ML drug testing program."

1989
Hard-luck pitcher Dave Stieb loses a perfect game when New York's Roberto
Kelly doubles with 2 out in the 9th inning, and Stieb finishes with a 2-1
two-hitter. It is the 3rd time that Stieb has lost a no-hitter with 2 out
in the 9th. Last September he lost back-to-back no-hit bids with two outs
in the ninth inning.

1990
The Braves trade Dale Murphy to the Phillies for Jeff Parrett, Jim Vatcher
and Victor Rosario. The move enables the youngster David Justice to return
to right field and win the Rookie-of-the-Year Award.

1992
At an auction in New York, actor Charlie Sheen pays $93,500 for the 'Mookie
Ball' which went through Bill Buckner's legs capping the miraculous Met
comeback in the sixth game of the Fall Classic in 1986. Arthur Richman,
the team's traveling secretary, who was given the ball that night by right
field umpire, Ed Montague, gives all the proceeds to charity. At the same
auction, an unidentified buyer purchases a toothpick once used by Mets Hall
of Fame P Tom Seaver for $400.

1993
OF Tony Gwynn of the Padres gets 6 hits in SD's 11-10 win over the Giants. It
is the 4th time this season he has 5 or more hits in a game, tying a major
league record set by Wee Willie Keeler in 1897, and equaled by Ty Cobb and
Stan Musial.

White Sox 3B Robin Ventura charges 46-year-old Nolan Ryan after a pitch
hits him in the 3rd inning. Ryan gets Ventura in a headlock and throws 6
punches to emerge the winner. Ventura is suspended 2 games for his actions,
while Ryan is not disciplined. Ryan (3-3) also is the winner with 7 IP,
5 K's and 3 hits allowed.

1994
Fan favorite Kent Hrbek announces his retirement effective at the end of
the season. The Twins first baseman, who played his entire 14-year career
in Minnesota, ranks near the top in virtually every team offensive category.

Seattle defeats California, 4-2, as Rich Gossage notches the win in
relief. It is Gossage's 1,000th major league appearance on the mound,
making him the 3rd pitcher to ever reach that milestone. Only Hoyt Wilhelm
(1,070) and Kent Tekulve (1,050) have gotten into more games as pitchers.
The future Hall of Fame reliever will end his 22-year career playing in
1002 games with seven different teams.

1995
The Giants roll over the Dodgers, 15-1, as winning pitcher Bill VanLandigham
hits his only career homer, off Tom Candiotti. Candy plunks him his next
time at-bat. Mark Carreon has 5 RBIs and Barry Bonds goes hitless but scores
4 runs.

At Colorado, the Rockies score 7 in the 1st inning, then hang on to beat the
Padres, 14-12. The Pads outhit the Rocks, 20-12, with Livingstone and Finley
collecting 4 hits apiece, and Phil Plantier hitting 2 homers and scoring
4 times. Bichette has 4 hits for Colorado and Joe Girardi adds a 3-run HR.

1996
Baltimore managers Earl Weaver and Ned Hanlon, Kentucky congressman Jim
Bunning and Negro League star Bill Foster are inducted into the Hall of Fame.

The Braves end their 17-game 20-day road trip, with a 6-4 win over the
Dodgers. The extended road stay is caused by the Atlanta-based Olympics.

Willard Brown, 81, dies. He was an All-Star outfielder in the Negro Leagues
and became the first black player to hit a homerun in the American League.

1997
The Twins beat the Blue Jays, 9-3, as Brad Radke ties a team record with
his 12th straight win. Greg Colbrunn's pinch-hit grand slam, off Chris
Carpenter, is the big blow. Radke is only the 3rd pitcher since 1950 to
win 12 consecutive starts. Bob Gibson of St. Louis did it in 1968 and Pat
Dobson did it with Baltimore in 1971.

At Anaheim, Jose Valentin, Dave Nilsson and Jeremy Burnitz homer in the
4th inning, all off Ken Hill, as Milwaukee beats Anaheim, 5-2, for its 10th
victory in 12 games. The loss drops Anaheim into a tie for first place in
the AL West with the idle Seattle Mariners.

Manny Ramirez homers and drives in four runs, and Jim Thome hits his 30th
homer as the Indians beat Detroit, 7-2. Charles Nagy improves to 12-4
lifetime against the Tigers, his most wins against any club. Thome is the
first Cleveland lefthanded hitter to hit 30 homers in successive seasons
since Hal Trosky in 1936-37. Scott Sanders (3-9), making his fourth start
since being traded to Detroit from Seattle, was the loser. He has lost all
three of his decisions in a Tigers uniform.

At Shea, the Mets top the Cards, 4-2, in a rain interupted game. Rick Reed
(10-4) wins his 6th straight, beating Manny Aybar, making his ML debut. Lance
Johnson has a pair of RBI triples. Completing an unusual major league-minor
league sweep, the Pittsfield Mets top the New Jersey Cardinals (NY-Penn
League), 8-4, in the earlier 9-inning game.

Kevin Tapani finally makes his Cubs debut, limiting Atlanta to five hits over
seven+ innings, as the Cubs win, 3-1. Tapani (1-0) signed to a three-year
$11 million deal with the Cubs after winning 13 games for the White Sox last
season, had surgery April 4 to remove scar tissue in his right index finger.

1998
OF Darryl Strawberry's PH grand slam is the big blow in NY's 9-run 9th
inning, as the Yankees come from behind to defeat the A's 10-5 in the 2nd
game of a DH. It is his 2nd PH slam of the season, setting a new AL record,
and tying the NL mark held by his former manager, Davey Johnson, and Mike
Ivie, both set in 1978. New York also wins the 1st game of the twinbill, 10-4.

Pittsburgh 1B Kevin Young goes 4 for 4, with 4 runs scored and 4 RBIs, to
lead the Pirates to a 13-5 mauling of the Rockies. Three of Young's hits
are doubles.

The Orioles' Mike Mussina carries a no-hitter into the 8th before
allowing a double to Frank Catallano. He ends up with a 2-hit 4-0 win
at Detroit. Broadcasting the game is the long-time voice of the Tigers,
Ernie Harwell. Ernie is celebrating his golden anniversary, starting as
an announcer for the Dodgers on August 4, 1948. The Dodgers had to trade
a player, Cliff Dapper, to the Atlanta Crackers to acquire Harwell.

1999
Prior to a game with the Royals, with his team in the midst of a slump
(losers in 15 of their last 19 games), Angels batting coach Rod Carew
suggests the club use a single bat through the starting lineup as a way of
loosening up the players. The team selects Jim Edmonds' bat. When leadoff
hitter Orlando Palmeiro strikes out in bottom half of the first inning,
he drops the bat for the next hitter to use. Umpire Tim Tschida sees this
as an act of defiance and ejects Palmeiro from the game. Anaheim manager
Terry Collins eventually convinces Tschida that Palmeiro wasn't trying to
show him up, and the umpire changes his decision and allows him to stay in
the game. All nine Angel batters use the same bat the first time through
the order yielding dramatic results when the Halos go 4 for 8 with one
walk in the first inning, including Bengie Molina first career hit, an RBI
double. The Angels go on to defeat the Royals, 4-3.

The Mariners send vet Butch Huskey to Boston for AAA pitcher Roberto
Ramsey. Tomorrow, they send vet 1B David Segui to Toronto for minor leaguers
Tom Davey and Steve Sinclair.

2000
Joining Dave Kingman, Frank Huelsman, Willis Hudlin, Paul Lehner, Wes
Covington, Ted Gray and Mike Kilkenny, Dave Martinez ties a major league
record as he appears for his fourth team in a season. In the past four
months the veteran outfielder/first baseman has played for the Devil Rays,
Cubs, Rangers and now the Blue Jays. The Blue Jays obtain OF Martinez from
the Rangers for a player to be named later.

With 32 home games remaining, the Astros, who moved from the pitcher-friendly
Astrodome to homer-haven Enron Field this season, set a franchise-record
by already hitting 83 homers at home this season.

The Padres obtain SS Desi Relaford from the Phillies for a player to be
named later.

2001
Braves 1B Wes Helms drives home a career-high 7 runs with a triple and a
pair of HRs as Atlanta defeats Milwaukee, 14-2. Helms had been hitless in
his previous 18 at-bats coming in to the game.

In a 4-2 Mets win at Arizona, Mark Grace ends the game with a ground single,
which hits pinch runner David Dellucci for the last out. It's the D'backs'
7th loss in 9 games.

2002
Cincinnati defeats San Diego, 15-10, as LF Russell Branyan slugs 3 HRs and
drives home 5 runs for the Reds.

The Braves edge the Cardinals, 2-1, as Damian Moss and John Smoltz combine
on a 1-hitter. Mike Matheny's single is the only St. Louis hit.

The Athletics defeat Detroit, 4-0, as Cory Lidle, Ricardo Rincon, Chad
Bradford and Billy Koch combine on the 1-hit shutout. Tiger OF Wendell
Magee's single is the only Detroit safety.

2003
Major League Baseball announces a five-year deal which will generate more
than $500 million in revenue for apparel and headwear global licensing
rights. The seven companies involved in the deal include Majestic Athletic,
New Era Cap, Twins Enterprises, Nike USA, Dynasty Apparel Industries,
Drew Pearson International and VF Imagewear.

2004
Continuing a tradition over half a century old, the Cardinals announce
their new ballpark scheduled to open in 2006, will also be known as Busch
Stadium. In 1953, a month after Anheuser-Busch purchased the Cardinals, the
brewery bought Sportsman Park renaming it Busch Stadium and then kept the
name in its new downtown stadium which opened in 1966 calling the facility
Busch Memorial Stadium.

Mike Matheny's major league errorless streak behind the plate ends when
his errant throw allows the runners to advance to second and third base on
an infield single. The Cardinals' catcher hadn't committed an error since
August 2, 2002, a span of 252 games. The Cardinals defeat the Expos, 5-4.

2005
After the team goes into a free fall from first place, the Orioles fire
manager Lee Mazzilli (129-140) and replaces him with bench coach Sam Perlozzo
on an interim basis. Currently suffering an eight-game losing streak, the
Birds have dropped 16 of their last 18 games. The change won't help. The
Orioles will join the 1978 A's as the only teams since 1900 to be 14 games
over .500 then fall at least 14 games under .500 in the course of a season.

The Brewers defeat the Mets, 12-9. Geoff Jenkins accounts for 5 of Milwaukee's
21 hits with 4 singles and a 2B.

At Atlanta, Jason LaRue hits a pinch grand slam in the 12th to power the
Reds to an 8-3 win over the Braves. The Reds overcome two homers and a
triple by Marcus Giles to win their first in 6 games. Ken Giffey Jr hits
his 536th career homer to tie Mantle on the all-time list, but leaves the
game in the 12th with an apparent twisted ankle. But he is out for the rest
of the year having pulled part of a tendon off the bone.

2006
At age 95, Elden Auker, the last living pitcher to face Babe Ruth, dies of
congestive heart failure. The author of Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms,
which he wrote when he was ninety, started his major league career in 1931
by striking out Babe Ruth and getting Lou Gehrig to pop out.

In the Phillies' 5-3 victory over the Mets, Chase Utley' s hitting streak
ends at 35 consecutive games. Philadelphia's second baseman, who goes 0
for 5, has the fourth longest stretch in National League history and tied
for the 8th-longest on the all-time list.

The Orioles trade C Javy Lopez and cash to the Red Sox for a player to
be named.

2007
Needing only 14 seasons to accomplish the feat, Alex Rodriguez becomes the
22nd and youngest player (32 years and 8 days) to hit 500 career homeruns. The
historic three-run homer, off Royals' starter Kyle Davies who was recently
acquired from the Braves, is hit into the left field seats at Yankee Stadium
making A-Rod and Mickey Mantle the only two players to reach the milestone
in the Bronx.

In the second inning at PETCO Park in of a front sellout crowd of 42,497
fans, Barry Bonds drives a Clay Hensley fastball over the left field wall for
his 755th homerun tying Hank Aaron's 33-year-old career homerun record. The
opposite-field drive, ironically off a pitcher who failed a steroid test as
a minor leaguer in 2005, is met with mix reactions as a few patrons hold up
asterisk signs and the crowd responds to the feat with a mixture of cheers
and jeers.

2008
At the start of the rain delay during the Astros and Cubs game at Wrigley
Field, fans are advised to take cover in the concourse due to a tornado
warning being issued by the National Weather Service for downtown Chicago. The
game resumes in 2 hours 45 minutes, but approximately an hour later more
thunder and lightning and another 39-minute stoppage causes the contest
to be called in the bottom of the eighth with Houston credited with a 2-0
rain-shortened victory.

During a Brewers' 6-3 loss to the Reds at Great American Ballpark, first
baseman Prince Fielder confronts starting pitcher Manny Parra in the dugout
shoving the hurler twice in the dugout after an angry exchange of words. The
Milwaukee hurler had taken a no-hitter into the fifth, but gave up six runs
on four hits and four walks before leaving the game for a pinch hitter in
the seventh inning.

The Mariners stun the Twins with a 10-run seventh inning coming back from
a 6-0 deficit in an eventual 11-6 victory at Safeco Field. With six runs
driven in, Raul Ibanez, who hits a grand slam and a two-run single in the
frame, establishes a club record for RBIs in one inning, one more than Ken
Griffey Jr's mark set in 1999.

2010
Exactly three years to the day he hit his 500th round-tripper, Alex Rodriguez
eclipses Babe Ruth in becoming the youngest major leaguer to hit 600 career
homeruns when he blasts a two-run first-inning shot into Monument Park at
Yankee Stadium. The 35-year-old Bronx Bomber third baseman is the seventh
player in baseball history to reach the milestone.

The Phillies obtain Mike Sweeney from the Mariners for a player to be named
later or cash considerations. The deal is necessitated for Philadelphia
when their All-Star first baseman Ryan Howard is put on the disabled list
with a severe sprained ankle.
