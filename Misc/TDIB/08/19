1901
Kid Nichols and Christy Mathewson square off the 3rd time in 7 days with
Nichols winning easily, 11-6. New York makes 4 errors, but a tired Matty
is pasted for 13 hits while striking out just one.

At St. Louis, the Pirates knock out the NL's leading pitcher Jack Harper
(21-8) in the 3rd enroute to a 9-5 win. Harper, 21-7 at the start of the day,
will end up at 23-13.

1902
Baltimore outfielder Albert 'Kip' Selbach sets the post-1900 mark in the
AL by making 4 errors, a mark tied by Braves flychaser Fred Nicholson in
1922. Baltimore loses to St. Louis, 11-4. Three of the errors come on fly
balls, and another hit goes through his legs. Another outfield error gives
the O's a ML record for OF errors.

The front-running Pirates edge the Giants, 5-4, when Ginger Beaumont plates
the winning run, scoring from 1B on a single. Jack Chesbro, on his way to
a 28-6 record is the winner.

1903
The Phillies do not play a scheduled game for a unprecedented ninth
consecutive time. None of the games from August 10 to 19 are played due
most likely to inclement weather.

1907
Red Sox Chick Stahl must wonder why he's managing. Jack Knight gets caught
at 3B in the 12th inning when Detroit 3B Charley O'Leary pulls the hidden
ball trick on him. Detroit wins, 4-3.

Washington's Sam Lanford, 21, in an ignominious debut, walks 2 Chicago
batters, hits 2, throws a wild pitch and balks - all in the first inning. He
gives up 4 runs in the 1st and 7 in the 3rd, as the Senators fall to the
White Sox, 16-2.

1908
The Highlanders' Jack Chesbro allows 11 hits, but shuts out Detroit, 7-0.

1909
The Phils end a series of rainouts with a split with the Giants. Doc Crandall
slices the Phillies, 6-4, but the Quakers come back to beat Mathewson,
1-0. Sherry Magee scores the only run in the bottom of the 9th to tag Matty
with the loss.

1910
At Cincinnati, the Giants win, 9-3, beating Jack Rowan. Mathewson allows 9
hits in coasting to his 20th win of the year and his 17th straight victory
over the Reds.

1911
Thirty-five thousand gather at the not-yet-completed Polo Grounds to watch
the Reds finally get to Christy Mathewson after 22 straight losses, beating
him for the first time since May of 1908. Matty, after saving the 5-4 opener
for Wiltse with two scoreless frames, starts the nightcap, goes 5 innings,
and loses 7-4. Mike Mitchell leads the Reds in the nitecap by hitting for
the cycle off Matty, and adding a double. A crowd of 35,000 views the loss.

1913
Grover Alexander is reached for nine straight hits and six runs as the Cubs
defeat the Phillies, 10-4.

The Reds' George Suggs loses a no-hitter against Boston when a ground ball
by Rabbit Maranville is juggled by 1B Dick Hoblitzel, who then throws wide
to Suggs covering 1B. The Reds win, 2-0, on Suggs' one-hitter, after winning
the first game of the twinbill, 4-2, behind Chief Johnson.

1914
Lefty Tyler stops the Reds for a 3-2 Braves win.

1915
Red Faber pitches the White Sox to a 2-1 win over the Red Sox, beating Rube
Foster. With the Tigers' win over the A's, Boston and Detroit are virtually
tied for 1st.

1917
Coaching at 3B in a 1-1 game against Washington, Ty Cobb gives base
runner "Tioga" George Burns a shove when Burns stops at 3B on a long hit.
Burns keeps going and scores the winning run. Clark Griffith protests,
and Ban Johnson upholds him, as the rules now ban coaches from touching a
runner. The game is replayed, and Washington wins 2-0.

As part of a benefit for the 69th New York regiment - which is about to depart
for France - the Giants move up the date of a game against the Cincinnati
Reds. The 2,100 European-bound troops march from the armory on 25th Street
and Lexington Avenue to the East River at 34th Street, where a ferry takes
them to the foot of 157th Street. The troops parade to the Polo Grounds,
entering through the Eighth Avenue gate, and drill on the field. A concert
follows. Then the Giants play their first official Sunday game within the
city limits. More than 25,000 fans watch the Reds shut out the Giants,
5-0. The Giants circumvent the Sunday law by stipulating that they are
charging patrons for the concert, then allowing them to watch the game for
free (with all proceeds turned over to war charities). But city officials
try to prosecute the two managers - Christy Mathewson of Cincinnati and John
McGraw of New York - for violating the Sunday Blue Law. Mathewson and McGraw
will be called to court two days after the game but the charges against them
will be quickly dismissed by Magistrate Frank McQuade, who actually praises
them. (McQuade, a rabid Giants fan, later becomes part owner of the team.)

1918
Walter Johnson beats St. Louis, 4-3, in 14 innings. The Big Train will work
in 15 extra-inning games, including 2 of 18 innings, one of 16 innings,
and another of 15 innings.

In the battle for 2nd place, the visiting Giants split with the Pirates,
losing 8-1 before coming back for a 2-1 win. The Bucs rough up Red Causey
for 12 hits in 6 innings in the opener, while Ralph Comstock scatters 9 hits
for the win. In the nitecap, Fred Toney allows just 3 hits in 8 innings,
and 3 more in the 9th, but emerges with the win over Wilbur Cooper.

Jack Quinn, pitching for the White Sox, trims the Yanks, 4-1, at the Polo
Grounds. While the Yankees maintain that Quinn, who was in the minor leagues,
is their property, he is wearing a Sox uniform, while Jack Fournier, awarded
to the Sox, is at 1B for New York. Fournier has 3 hits today off Quinn, who
has yet to lose. A busy Ray Caldwell, who pitched Saturday for his Weehawken
ship yard team (and reportedly played CF for them on Sunday) is the loser.

Edd Roush hits a grand slam, off Rube Marquard in the 7th, to lead the Reds
to an 8-4 win over visiting Brooklyn.

1919
In a matchup of old buddies, Chicago's Grover Alexander outpitches Shufflin'
Phil Douglas, to beat the Giants, 4-2. After the game, Douglas will fall
off the wagon with a bang and end up back in Tennessee. The Giants will
suspend Phil, but he'll return to have three good seasons with the Giants.

1920
Despite Ruth's 43rd HR of the year, the Indians' Slim Caldwell allows just
4 other hits to top the Yanks, 3-2. The Indians answer with homers by Elmer
Smith and two hits from new shortstop Harry Lunte. The Indian players leave
immediately for Cleveland and Chapman's funeral with a half-game lead over
Chicago and 1 1/2 over the Yankees. It will be the tightest race since 1908.

Ban Johnson states diplomatically that Carl Mays "is greatly affected [by the
fatal beaning] and may never be capable temperamentally of pitching again."

In Cincinnati, the Reds strengthen their hold on 1st place, beating their
nearest rivals the Dodgers, 3-2, in 13 innings. Leon Cadore, who takes over
for Grimes after 10 innings, loses to reliever Jimmy Ring.

1921
In game 2 at Boston, Ty Cobb gets hit No. 3,000, off Boston P Elmer Myers. At
34, he's the youngest ever to do so. Ty has 3 of the 19 hits that Myers
allows. Cole gives up 4 to win, 10-0. Boston takes the opener, 13-8, as Cobb
collects 3 hits. The 'Georgia Peach' will end his career with 4,191 hits,
the most ever in the major leagues until Pete Rose surpasses the mark in 1985.

1922
In Philadelphia, the Browns and A's split a pair, with St. Louis taking the
opener, 9-5. Urban Shocker is backed by Ken Williams' 31st HR. He hits his
32nd in the nitecap, but the A's win, 6-5, when Bing Miller bangs a 2-run
HR in the 8th off Rasty Wright. The split allows the Yankees, winner over
Chicago, to move back into first place.

1925
The Phils finally solve Reds righthander Pete Donohue, topping him 5-4,
after losing to him 20 straight times. The losing streak began in 1921.

Host Salt Lake City (PCL) splits a pair with Portland, winning 29-9 and
losing 9-4. In the first game, the Bees' RF Lefty O'Doul is 5 for 6 while
catcher John Peters is 4 or 6 with 2 doubles and 6 runs.

1930
Goose Goslin hits 3 consecutive HRs for St. Louis to back George Blaeholder's
7-0 shutout of the Philadelphia A's.

In the first of two, Chicago's Hack Wilson connects off Phils P Sugar
Sweetland for his 43rd HR, tying Chuck Klein's NL record set last year. In
RF, Klein waves to Wilson as he circles the bases. The Phils hold on for
a 9-8 win with Claude Willoughby the winner over rookie Bud Teachout. The
second game ends in a 6-6 tie after 16 innings.

1931
At Chicago, Lefty Grove (25-2) wins his 16th consecutive game, 4-2, tying
the AL record set by Walter Johnson and Joe Wood in 1912. Grove holds the
Sox scoreless till the 9th, while the A's score in the 2nd, 3rd and 8th
off Red Faber. Grove has completed all but one of the wins.

The Giants score single runs in each of the last 3 innings to beat the
Reds, 6-5. Giants Shanty Hogan is the first catcher to start 3 DPs - only
one other catcher, Damian Miller in 1999 - will match him. The 3 DPs ties
a ML record for catchers.

1934
The Red Sox draw a record 50,000 (46,995 paid) to Fenway, but drop two games
to the Tigers, 8-6 and 4-3. Detroit batters three Red Sox pitchers - Lefty
Grove, Henry Johnson and Herb Pennock - to win the opener, overcoming a cycle
spree in 5 at-bats by Moose Solters against Alvin "General" Crowder. Moose
is collared in the nitecap loss, going 0 for 4.

The Harvard University varsity team tours Japan, winning only 5 of 11 games
against collegiate and club teams.

1935
The Indians score 6 in the 8th, led by Hal Trosky's grand slam, to beat the
visiting Senators, 11-5. Earl Averill adds a homer and SS Bill Knickerbocker
seemingly adds another when his 1st inning drive sticks in the lattice work
of RF as he circles the bases. When umpire Dinneed orders him back to 2B,
manager Steve O'Neill lodges a protest.

1936
For the third time in two weeks, Mel Ott and rookie Jimmy Ripple hit
back-to-back homers as the Giants edge the Dodgers, 3-2. Ott's 27th in the
8th is deep but when Ripple's ball is touched by a fan it touches off a
Casey Stengel tirade that gets the perfessor tossed. The homers break up
a pitching duel between Carl Hubbell and Max Butcher and leaves the Giants
just a game behind the leading Cardinals.

The Cubs fall to 2 1/2 in back of the Cards when they drop a 5-4 decision
to the Pirates. Pittsburgh reliever Bill Swift halts a Cub rally in the 8th,
then drives home the winning run in the 9th with a single off Charlie Root.

In Washington, Joe DiMaggio breaks a 2-2 tie with a two-out homer in the
5th off Jimmy DeShong and the first-place Yankees roll on to a 7-4 win. Red
Ruffing pitches a complete game, while DiMag and Dickey collect three hits
apiece. Stone has a homer for the Nats.

Buck Ross and Harry Kelley pitch the last-place A's to a double victory over
the Red Sox, 5-4 and 7-2. Ross wins the first in 13 innings when Frankie
Hayes hits a homer off Johnny Marcum to win. In the 7th, Bill Werber's
3-run homer breaks a 1-1 tie but the A's rally to tie. In the nitecap,
Kelley wins his 16th, scattering 11 hits to beat Fritz Ostermueller.

1937
In Chicago, Detroit's Rudy York has six RBIs on two homers, one a grand
slam, when he comes up in the 7th with the bases loaded again. York hits
a shot to dead center that bounces off the wall, but Hank Greenberg, the
runner on 1B, holds up thinking the ball might be caught, and only manages
to lumber into 3B. York reaches 2B with "the longest double ever hit in
Comiskey Park." Gee Walker adds a pair of homers. However, rain washes out
the inning - and York's hit - and the score reverts to the end of 6 innings
at 12-4. Because of his precarious health, manager Mickey Cochrane does
not accompany the team to St. Louis.

In a PCL match between Sacramento and San Diego, umpire Jack Powell is
arrested on the field in the 6th inning for drunkenness. Powell, considered
the best ump in the PCL, took the field against the advice of friends and
his fellow umps, and immediately got into arguments with the players. After
calling a Sacramento runner out at 2B in the 5th, even though the second
baseman dropped the ball, the arrest is made. Sacramento, losers by 8-6,
protests the game.

1938
When Detroit's Billy Rogell walks his first time up, it is his 7th consecutive
base on balls, a new AL record. Jose Canseco, Mel Ott and Eddie Stanky will
tie Rogell's patience in this century. Rogell is 0 for 3 in game 1, an 8-7
win over the Browns, then goes 0 for 5 in game 2, a 7-4 Tiger win. Hank
Greenberg hits 3 homers in the doubleheader.

In preparation for the 1940 Olympic tournament in Tokyo, the U.S. Olympic
Baseball team loses, 5-3, to England in a rain-shortened 6-inning match in
Leeds. The England side, consisting mostly of Canadians and other Commonwealth
players, has now beaten the Americans in four of the five games, and the
International Baseball Federation will crown the Brits as the Inaugural World
Amateur Champions. The outbreak of the War will cancel the 1940 Olympic Games.

1939
Ted Williams leads the Red Sox to an 8-6 win over Washington by hitting
his first ML grand slam. He'll hit his 2nd in 10 days.

1940
Hot-hitting Jimmy Foxx belts his 33rd HR, against Cleveland, as the host
Red Sox roll to a 16-7 win.

1941
Pittsburgh Pirates manager Frankie Frisch is ejected (and fined $50) by
umpire Jocko Conlan from the 2nd game of a doubleheader when he appears on
the field with an umbrella to protest the playing conditions at Brooklyn's
Ebbets Field. The rainy argument is later portrayed in a famous oil painting
by Norman Rockwell. The Dodgers sweep, winning 9-0 and 6-2, behind Curt
Davis and Hugh Casey.

In game 2 at Detroit, Joe DiMaggio jams his spikes sliding into 2B on a
double and sprains his ankle. He will be out till September 19th. The Yanks
win, 8-3, after losing the opener, 12-2, to Hal Newhouser.

White Sox pitchers Thornton Lee and John Humphries each throw shut outs
against the A's. Lee wins, 4-0 and Humphries, 1-0. McCrabb and Babich are
the losing pitchers.

1945
In game 2 of a doubleheader against the Reds, 37-year-old slugger Jimmie Foxx
makes his first ML start, pitching the first 7 innings for the Philadelphia
Blue Jays. He leaves with a 4-1 lead, and Andy Karl saves Foxx' only ML
decision, a 6-2 final. Double X's ERA in 10 ML appearances is 1.52. Foxx'
opponent is Howie Fox, who started yesterday's game as well. The lidlifter
goes to the Phils as well, 5-0, though they are mathematically eliminated
from a 1st place finish.

The Yankees win the first of 2 with the White Sox, 4-2, to break their 9-game
losing streak, the longest under McCarthy. Chicago takes the nitecap, 2-0,
as Lefty Grove gives up just 5 hits, 3 by Metheny.

1947
Led by Eddie Miller's grand slam and 6 RBIs, the Reds trounce the Giants,
6-1. Johnny Vander Meer is the winner over Dave Koslo.

1948
In the Eastern Shore League, Ed Santulli of Rehoboth Beach pitches a 10-0
no-hitter over Federalsburg, the 3rd no-hitter in the league in 4 days. On
August 16, Ed Black of Salisbury no-hit Milford, 4-0, while Gene Kern of
Cambridge did the same, beating Federalsburg, 12-0.

1949
The Phillies host 'Eddie Waitkus Night' at Shibe Park and shower their injured
first baseman with gifts. The All-Star infielder, in uniform for the first
time since June, had been shot in the chest at Chicago's Edgewater Beach
Hotel by Ruth Ann Steinhagen, an obsessed fan upset with his trade from
the Cubs to Philadelphia.

1950
The Gillette Safety Razor Co. pays $800,000 for TV rights to the WS. Radio
rights will add another $175,000 more.

The Pirates outslug the Cubs, 13-9, for their 6th win in 7 games. Ralph Kiner
slugs two homers to put him seven days and nine games ahead of last year,
when he hit 54. He has rapped 8 this month and 4 in the last 5 games. Clyde
McCullough adds a bases-loaded triple, sac fly and two-run double, while
Johnny Hopp homers. The Cubs answer with homers by Hank Sauer, Mickey Owen
and Roy Smalley, but its not enough. Reliever Bob Rush loses to Murry Dickson.

1951
In his most interesting promotional stunt, Bill Veeck signs a 3'7" midget,
Eddie Gaedel, who goes to bat wearing the number 1/8 in the first inning
of the nightcap with the Tigers. Lefty Bob Cain laughingly walks him on 4
pitches. Jim Delsing then pinch runs, but the Tigers win, 6-2, after winning
5-2. Two days later the ML bars Eddie Gaedel from appearing in any more games.

In Boston, the Braves score 5 in the 6th and roll over the Dodgers,
13-4. Warren Spahn picks up his 15th win and his 21st complete game. A
2nd-inning homer by Willard Marshall, off Ralph Branca, starts the scoring.

In Philadelphia, the Giants overcome a 4-run deficit to win, 5-4, and cut
Brooklyn's lead to 8 games. Al Corwin wins in relief, after Bobby Thomson's
2-run homer gets the Giants on the board. The Giants have won 9 in a row,
with tomorrow a day off.

1955
For the sixth consecutive season, Robin Roberts is a 20-game winner (the
first 20-game winner this season). The Phillies right-hander, who will
finish the season with a 23-14 record, beats Don Newcombe and the first
place Dodgers at Connie Mack Stadium, 3-2. Roberts beat Newk by the same
score 5 days ago and in both games Willie Jones drives in the winning run.

At Comiskey Park, Billy Pierce shuts out the Tigers, 3-0.

1956
The visiting Braves beat the Reds, 3-1, with actress Elizabeth Taylor in
attendance. She is filming the movie Raintree County in Kentucky.

1957
Citing poor attendance as the reason, Giants president Horace Stoneham,
ignoring baseball's edict of banning announcements about relocation of
franchises until after the World Series, informs the press the club has
signed a lease to play its home games in San Francisco next season, as San
Francisco promises a new stadium in the Bayview area. The club's Board of
Directors voted 8-1 approving the shift to the West Coast, with the only
dissenting vote cast by M. Donald Grant, who will become the chairman of
the Mets, an expansion team located in New York to fill the National League
void created by the departure of the Giants and Dodgers to California.

1958
Giants hurler Johnny Antonelli hits the 1st homer by a pitcher at Seals
Stadium, and also tosses a 4-3 win in 10 innings over the Reds.

In an oddity, each starting player of the Douglas Copper Kings team hits
a HR in a 22-8 rout of the Chihuahua Dorados (Arizona-Mexican League).

1959
Honolulu seeks a franchise in the Continental League.

1961
The Phils rally in the 9th, but strand 11 and lose, 4-3 to Milwaukee. For
the hapless Quakers, it is their 22nd loss in a row. For the Braves,
it is their 9th win in a row. The Phils have 13 hits off Tony Cloninger,
the winner, while Frank Sullivan allows just 7. The Braves score all their
runs in the 3rd, the big blow being Frank Thomas' 2-run homer.

The Reds surge to a 3-game lead in the NL by topping the Cards, 3-1, behind
Joey Jay. They now lead by 3 games. The Reds get on the board in the 6th on
Wally Post's homer, his 16th. He has now homered this year in every NL park.

The Red Sox top the Tigers, 5-3, as the two teams combine to hit into 8
double plays, tying the ML record for 9 innings.

1962
Gino Cimoli, Wayne Causey and Billy Bryan of the Athletics hit consecutive
HRs in the 7th inning, but Elston Howard has 2 HRs and 8 RBIs; Bill Skowron,
a HR and 4 RBIs; Mickey Mantle, a grand slam and 7 RBIs; and Skowron 4 RBIs
as the Yankees rout the A's, 21-7. Mantle adds 2 stolen bases before Jack
Reed takes over in CF and has 2 at-bats.

Cleveland Indians President Mike Wilson dies at age 74.

1963
At Fenway Park, Dick Stuart's towering fly ball becomes an adventure for
Indians outfielder Vic Davalillo when it strikes the ladder attached to
the wall above the scoreboard. After ricocheting off the fence, the ball
bounces off the head of the center fielder, and before he can retrieve it,
the slow-footed Red Sox first baseman crosses the plate for a very improbable
inside-the-park homerun in Boston's 8-3 loss to Cleveland.

1965
In a magnificent performance, Reds P Jim Maloney's records his 2nd 10-inning
no-hit effort of 1965. It is another 0-0 duel through 9 innings, until
Reds SS Leo Cardenas homers off the LF foul pole in the 10th at Wrigley
Field. Maloney sets a no-hit record by allowing 10 walks, and fans 12 in
Cincinnati's 1-0 win. Larry Jackson is the losing pitcher. Earlier in the
season the Fresno native had also no-hit the Mets for ten innings, but lost
the game in the eleventh when Johnny Lewis homered.

At San Francisco, Don Drysdale faces Warren Spahn in the start of a critical
four-game series. Drysdale lasts longer than Spahn, allowing five runs
through eleven innings and leaves with the game tied. The Dodgers win it
in 15 innings, 6-5.

1967
The Red Sox continue winning, beating California, 12-11. Norm Siebern hits
a pinch triple with the bases loaded and Yaz has 4 hits, including his
29th homer.

1968
Bob Gibson pitches the Cardinals to a 2-0 win over the Phillies. Gibson
strikes out 11 batters including Dick Allen 4 times, the 7th time this season
the Phils' sluggers has K'ed 4 times. He will strike out a career-high 161
times this season. For Gibson, it is his club record 10th shutout of the
year and his 15th straight win. His ERA is an even 1.00.

For the 2nd time this year, the Mets lose a marathon 1-0 game, this time
losing to the Giants in 17 innings. Ron Hunt's single, off Taylor, drives in
Lanier with the lone run. Koosman and Bolin go 12 and 11 innings as starters,
with the win going to Linzy and Mike McCormick picking up a save. The Mets
lost 1-0 in 24 innings on April 15.

1969
Cub Ken Holtzman (14-7) pitches the 5th no-hitter of 1969. Ron Santo's 3-run
HR in the first inning off Phil Niekro provides first-place Chicago with a 3-0
win against Atlanta. Holtzman is the first no-hit hurler with no strikeouts
since Sam Jones on September 4, 1923. LF Billy Williams, with his back against
the vines, hauls in Aaron's drive in the 7th to preserve the no-hitter.

Giants starter Juan Marichal gives up a game-ending homer to the Mets'
Tommy Agee in the 14th inning as the Mets win, 1-0. Tug McGraw is the winner
in relief.

John "Swede" Hollison dies in Chicago at age 99. He was the last surviving
ML pitcher to throw from a mound 50 feet from home plate. He pitched in
one game in 1892.

1970
The White Sox erupt for 11 runs on 10 hits in the 9th inning to defeat the
Red Sox, 13-5.

Fergie Jenkins homers and his teammates add another 6 as Chicago coasts
over San Diego, 12-2. Jim Hickman (2), Glenn Beckert, John Callison, Joe
Pepitone and Billy Williams also round trip for Chicago. Six of the Cub
homers are solo shots and San Diego adds a solo homer. The 7 solo homers
by 2 teams sets a NL record and ties the ML mark set on April 29, 1962.

1973
Behind P Jim Rooker, the Pirates top San Francisco, 5-0, to move 2 games
out of 1st in the NL East. Rooker also leads the way hitting 3 for 3.

1974
Reds 2B Joe Morgan drives in 7 runs as Cincinnati rolls over Philadelphia,
15-2. Morgan has a grand slam and a 3-run homer, then leaves after 3 innings
when the Reds build a 14-0 lead.

1975
The Astros hire Bill Virdon to replace Preston Gomez as manager.

The Cardinals' Lynn McGlothen strikes out 3 Reds on 9 pitches in the 2nd
inning of a 2-1 victory. The loss snaps the Reds' 9-game win streak.

1977
Backed by homers from Reggie Jackson and Bucky Dent, Mike Torrez hurls his
6th complete game in a row and New York beats Texas, 8-1. The Yanks are
now 2 1/2 games in back of Boston.

1980
Jon Matlack holds George Brett hitless, snapping his hitting streak at 30
consecutive games, but Kansas City rallies for 3 runs in the 9th to beat
Texas, 4-3. Brett batted .467 during the streak and knocked in 42 runs.

Baltimore's Steve Stone becomes the first 20-game winner in the major
leagues this season, holding the Angels hitless for 7 1/3 innings on the
way to a 5-2 victory.

In New York's 3-1 win at Seattle, Bob Watson is 3 for 3 including a homer
and a double, the latter off the left CF speaker at the Dome in the 2nd
inning. It is retrieved by 3B Stein.

1982
Scheduled to pitch against the Expos in a home game, Braves rookie Pascual
Perez misses the start of the game when he can't find his way to the ball
park. Perez circles on the expressway several times but got lost. He will
be given a Braves jacket with the new number I-85 on it. Niekro takes the
mound and wins, 5-4, to run his record to 11-3.

1983
The Dodgers trade pitchers Dave Stewart and Ricky Wright to Texas for
star pitcher Rick Honeycutt, who was 14-8 with an AL-best 2.42 ERA for the
Rangers. Honeycutt will go 2-3 down the stretch for the Dodgers, but still
wins the AL ERA title because his 174 2/3 innings pitched were already
enough to qualify.

1985
The Mets move into 1st place in the NL East with a 1-0 win over the Expos. Ron
Darling with relief help from McDowell, is the winner.

At Milwaukee, Roy Smalley's homer in the 5th is the Twins' only hit off
Danny Darwin. The Brewers win, 2-1.

1987
Molitor collects 4 hits to extend his hit streak to 34 games and tie Dom
DiMaggio for the 11th spot on the all-time list. The Brewers beat Cleveland,
13-2. Rob Deer has a grand slam for the Brewers, and tomorrow will hit another
- just the 11th player in history to hit grand slams in consecutive games.

1989
Cubs center fielder Jerome Walton extends his hitting streak to 29 games
in an 8-4 loss to Houston at the Astrodome. With his seventh-inning single,
the 24-year-old rookie establishes the longest consecutive-game hit streak
in modern franchise history, surpassing the mark set by Ron Santo in 1966.

1990
White Sox Bobby Thigpen records his 40th save as the Chicago White Sox
beat the Rangers, 4-2. He becomes only the eighth reliever to reach this
milestone in major league history.

Dodger SS Jose Offerman leads off the bottom of the first with a HR in his
first ML at-bat, but that is all the LA scoring as Montreal wins 2-1. Offerman
had not homered all season in the minors.

1992
Mariners 2B Bret Boone makes his major league debut against the Orioles. By
doing so, he becomes the first 3rd-generation player in the major leagues,
following in the footsteps of his grandfather Ray (1948-60), and his
father Bob (1972-90). Boone goes 1 for 4 and drives in a run in Seattle's

by the 1988 Orioles, and four more will tie the major league mark of 23
endured by 1961 Phillies.
