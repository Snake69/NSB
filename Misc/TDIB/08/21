1901
At Washington, umpire John Haskell is involved in another violent incident
during the Washington-Sox game when Sox SS Frank Shugart punches Haskell
after a disputed ball-four call, followed by a Senators bases-loaded
triple. Teammate John Katoll tries to add his two cents, and a fan jumps in
punching Shugart. The police intervene and both players are arrested. Shugart
will be expelled. Washington's Win Mercer lives up to his name with an 8-0
win over Chicago. The incident starts in the 4th inning with the score 1-0
when Haskell calls a ball four to load the bases. Clingman then triples
and the battery of Sugden and Katoll start berating the ump for the ball-4
call. Sugden then lets a pitch go by him that strikes the umpire, and
Haskell waves in Clingman from third. Katoll then fires a pitch at Haskell
that strikes him on the leg. At the start of the next inning Shugart follows
Sugden at the plate and the two start in on Haskell before Shugart swings.

In Baltimore, Orioles pitcher Joe McGinnity is tossed for spitting in
the face of umpire Tom Connally. When Detroit's Kid Elberfeld intervenes,
he is decked by Baltimore's Mike Donlin. Bill Keister also gets involved,
as do some fans, and the police, who arrest the players and a fan. Judge
Harry Goldman, a part-owner of the O's, releases the players and fines the
fan $100. McGinnity is suspended for 10 days for the spitting, which he
says was not spitting but throwing his tobacco quid at him. Ban Johnson
will reduce the suspension after meeting with McGinnity and John McGraw
(source:  Terry Simpkins).

1902
Sam Leever hurls a two hitter to give the first-place Pirates a 2-0 win
over the Giants and Mathewson.

1903
Ducky Holmes, White Stockings OF, has 4 assists in a game, tying the ML
record. But his team still loses, 11-3, to Cy Young and the Boston Americans.

In a singular effort, Philadelphia's Rube Waddell allows 3 hits in edging
the Tigers, 1-0, in the opener of a doubleheader. Wild Bill Donovan,
who sets the AL record this year by losing five 1-0 games is the opposing
starter. Donovan has one of the three hits. Waddell then pitches the nitecap
as well, giving up 8 hits before losing, 2-1. With 13 K's in the DH Rube
boosts his strikeout total to a record 302 for the season. This is the last
he'll pitch this year. Donovan will be 2nd in the AL with 187. With his
two complete games today, the overworked Rube finishes the year with 34,
which will tie him with Cy Young and Donovan.

In their 2nd straight doubleheader, the Pirates and Giants again split,
with the Bucs taking the opener, 5-0, behind Sam Leever. Mathewson wins
the nitecap for New York, 9-5, the 8th time he's whipped Pittsburgh this
year. Matty scatters 10 singles and Ginger Beaumont's double.

1905
The Giants run past the Pirates, 10-2, with Mathewson defeating Deacon
Phillippe. New York swipes 5 bases including a steal of home by Art Devlin.

1908
Pittsburgh regains first place as Nick Maddox (15-5) beats Brooklyn, 2-1,
for his 8th win in a row. Maddox drives in both runs as well. Maddox,
who won his last 5 games of 1907, has now won 20 games in 30 appearances,
the quickest twenty-game winner ever (this mark will be tied by Russ Ford,
in 1910; Boo Ferriss in 1945 and Cal Eldred in 1993).

Senators catcher Gabby Street stands at the base of the Washington Monument
and catches the 13th ball dropped from the top, 555 feet up, duplicating
the feat performed by Pop Schriver of the Chicago Colts on August 24,
1894. Billy Sullivan of the Chicago White Sox will repeat the catch on August
24, 1910. Street gets a $500 prize for his morning's efforts, then spends
the afternoon behind the plate catching Walter Johnson's 3-1 win over Detroit.

1909

takes the loss when Larry Doyle walks in the 1st, goes to 3B on a ground
out and scores on another grounder.

Jack Taylor, former iron man pitcher in the NL, hurls two complete games
in the Central League. On the mound for Dayton, he shuts out Terra Haute on
2 hits to win, 4-0, in game one, then wins 1-0 in 11 innings in game 2. On
June 4th, pitching for Grand Rapids in the same league, Taylor threw a 1-0
no-hitter over Fort Wayne.

Thomas C. Noyes, president and part owner of the Senators, dies, opening
the way for Clark Griffith to eventually become club owner.

and beat New York ace Mathewson, 3-2. Al Demaree relieves Matty in the 6th,
but Big Six takes his 4th loss in a row. The New York lead drops to a game.

1918
Led by Edd Roush's three hits, including a double and a triple, the Reds
edge the Phils, 4-3, in 10 innings. Each starter goes the distance with

he records seven assists in one game.

1920
In Boston, the Red Sox sweep a Saturday doubleheader from the shell-shocked
Indians, who play without Speaker, still in Cleveland dealing with matters
relating to Chapman's death. Pitchers Waite Hoyt and Herb Pennock each allow
just 3 hits in throwing shutouts, winning 12-0 and 4-0. The 2 losses drop
the Indians into 2nd place behind the first place White Sox, double winners
in Washington. The Sox have won 10 of their last 12 games.

Pittsburgh pitcher Wilbur Cooper starts his 2nd triple play of the year,
a ML record, but the Pirates lose, 3-1, to the Phils.

he is severely injured. His health will not be the same afterwards and he
will die in less than two years.

1921
At St. Louis, the largest crowd of the season cheer as the Browns sweep
a pair from the Yankees, winning 5-4 and 10-0. Bayne strikes out 7 of the
1st 9 Yanks in game 2 on his way to a 10-K run.

1922
With homers by Welch and Perkins in the 1st inning, the A's jump to a 5-0
lead over the Browns, and hold on for a 7-6 win. George Sisler has a pair
of hits to stay in the batting lead and Ken Williams runs his consecutive
batting streak to 25 games. The idle Yankees lead by a full game.

In Boston, the Tigers score 10 runs in the 6th inning to blast the Red Sox,
16-3. Emory Rigney reaches base twice in the frame on errors, the first
player to do that. Veach is 3 for 3 with 4 runs scored.

1923
A 4-piece bat used by Ruth is banned by AL president Ban Johnson because of
the glue used on it. A protest is made against the Browns' Ken Williams for
using a bat with a wooden plug in it. Johnson rules that all bats must be
one piece with nothing added except tape extending to 18 inches up the handle.

1924
At Redlands Field, the Reds whitewash the Phils, 11-0. As noted by historians
Greg Rhoades and John Snyder, the Reds were delayed as the train they were

Cincinnati at 3:00 p.m., the scheduled game time, and rush to the park to
play at 3:45.

1926
In Boston, it takes Ted Lyons just 67 minutes and 81 pitches to no-hit the Red
Sox, 6-0, for Chicago. Lyons strikes out 2 and walks just one - the leadoff

old) hits his 600th HR, off George Blaeholder of the Browns, as the Yankees

their 10 years as teammates, they will homer in the same inning 19 times
and in the same game 72 times.

1932
Defeating the Senators, 11-5, at Washington's Griffith Stadium, Indians
hurler Wes Ferrell becomes the first pitcher in this century to win 20 or

who will post a 23-12 record this season, won 21, 25 and 22 games for
Cleveland during the past three years.

1933

and two errors.

1935
At Braves Field, Cardinals first baseman Ripper Collins does not make a put
out during the 13-3 nine-inning loss to Boston. The St. Louis infielder,

against Brooklyn in 1937, is the only player to have accomplished the very
rare feat twice in the major leagues.

The Phils outlast the Cubs, 13-12, but the Cubs turn around in the nitecap
and win, 19-5, scoring 12 runs in the 6th inning. Frank Demaree has 8 hits

the mound during a Yankee rally in New York and is suspended and fined $1,000
by Boston manager Joe Cronin. It is the second time in 5 days he has walked
off the mound, having done it in Boston last Sunday in a game against the
Senators. Ferrell, furious when he hears about the fine, says he will not pay
it. "They can suspend me or trade me, but they're not getting any dough from
me." The Red Sox lift the suspension in 4 days but will trade Ferrell after
the season. The Yanks win, 4-1, handing Ferrell his 14th loss of the year.

Babe Herman, who quit the Reds in a dispute over a bonus, rejoins the team
on orders from Commissioner Landis. Herman was suspended on August 18 after

the Browns more than a month ago. In the opener, McQuinn and former A's
catcher Frankie Hayes hit homers for St. Louis.

At Cleveland, Charley Keller and Bill Dickey hit homers to pace the Yankees
to an 8-3 win over the Indians. For Dickey, it is his 200th homer. Jeff Heath

three hits and a RBI, and is now tied with Rudy York for the RBI lead with 84.

Rudy York belts his 12th homer of the month, but the Tigers lose in 12

ends in the ninth inning when Bob Lemon walks Pat Seerey and yields homeruns
to Aaron Robinson and Dave Philley in a 3-2 loss to the White Sox. The
scoreless streak by Indians pitchers started with the last three innings
of the first game on August 15. The 1903 Cleveland team had had a run of 41
scoreless innings and Baltimore will extend the record in 1974 to 54 innings.

Representatives of Cuba, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, meeting in
Havana, agree to stage a 4-country round-robin 12-game tournament to be

participate on a regular basis.

1949
A barrage of bottles from the Philadelphia stands as protest of a decision by
umpire George Barr over a trapped line drive by Ashburn results in the first
forfeiture in the ML in 7 years. Umpires Al Barlick and Lee Ballanfant are
hit by flying objects during the 15-minute melee. The Giants, who receive
this forfeit, gave one away in 1942 when hordes of youngsters invaded the
field. The Giants are leading, 4-2, with one out in the 9th of the second game
of a doubleheader when the forfeit occurs. Per the rules in effect, neither
pitcher - Larry Jansen nor Schoolboy Rowe - get a decision. As a result of
the forfeit, Shibe Park officials ban the sale of soft drinks in bottles.

in their negotiations with the owners. NL prexy Warren Giles intones,
"The players can do more for themselves than any outside representative,
no matter how able that outsider may be."

At St. Louis, rookie Haddix wins his 16th, defeating the Reds on 4 hits. For
the 2nd time in a month Stanky is involved in a batting-out-of-turn incident,
but this time it works to his advantage. After Bilko strikes out in the 2nd,
Stanky realizes that it should have been Jablonski's turn and notifies the
umps. Bilko gets another chance and belts a homer.

play in the 4th inning after catching a line drive off the bat of Jim Fridley.

inning, Houston's Jeff Leonard flies to CF to apparently end the game. Umpire

1991

the Atlanta Braves in time for tonight's twinbill with the Reds. Even
without him, the Braves are just two games behind the Dodgers in the NL West.

League. Helena has 27 hits, including six homers, but sets no records. The

win both, 4-3 and 8-5.

Field. Aaron Boone hits one in the 6th and Eddie Taubensee in the next inning.

going 1 for 4.

2002

P Russ Rohlicek and two players to be named.

Much to the delight of the Fenway Faithful and the embarrassment of the
team's first baseman, the 'Rally Karaoke Guy' makes his debut when a video
of Kevin Millar, as an LA City College freshman doing an impersonation of
Bruce Springsteen singing "Born in the USA," is shown on the scoreboard. The
video, which was first played at a clubhouse meeting in Texas as a prank
by a college now-FBI-agent friend, appears to be Boston's answer to the
Rally Monkey of Anaheim as the Red Sox win their first game in seven days
beating the A's, 14-5.

2004
The Dodgers down the Braves, 7-4. LA P Jeff Weaver ties a ML record in the
first inning when he hits 3 consecutive batters with pitches.

while Barry Bonds is 4 for 4 with two doubles, a triple and two walks.

2005

Florida suspends their bat boy for six games after the 11-year-old accepts
former Marlin and current Dodger hurler Brad Penny's $500 dare to drink a
gallon of milk in less than an hour without throwing up. The sixth grader,

down, will be offered by the Milk Processor Education Program a promise to
pay off the dare and will cover the lost wages resulting from the suspension
if he agrees to drink three glasses every 24 hours.

2006
For the first time since 1943, the Yankees sweep a five-game series at
Fenway. The latest Boston massacre leaves the Red Sox six and half games
behind front-running New York and four games off the wild card pace.
Cory Lidle, recently obtained from the Phillies along with Bobby Abreu
in a trade-deadline deal, throws six scoreless innings to get today's 2-1
win. Dubbed the "Boston Massacre II", the lopsided series reminds fans of
the rivalry of a similar meltdown in Boston in 1978.

After seeing his starting pitcher give back seven runs of a 8-0 lead
in the third inning, John Gibbons goes to the mound to remove Ted Lily,

a bloody nose for the Toronto skipper.

player to collect 10 RBIs in one contest in big league history.

Mark Reynolds ties a major league record, held by five other non-pitchers
including Bo Jackson of the Royals in 1988, by striking out in nine
consecutive plate appearances. The dubious streak comes to an end as Dave
Bush hits the Diamondbacks' third baseman with a pitch in the sixth inning
in a 7-4 Brewer victory at Chase Field.

Citing he would be heavily taxed on the historically significant souvenir
if he were to hold onto it, 21-year-old Matt Murphy reclutantly decides
to sell the ball Barry Bonds hit to break Henry Aaron's all-time homerun
record. The August 7th AT&T Park homerun ball, valued at an estimated
$500,000, will be available from August 28 through September 15 through a
Sotheby's/SCP on-line action.

2010
After being heckled by Philadelphia fans between innings, Nyjer Morgan
throws a ball into the Citizens Bank Park outfield seats hitting a fan in
the head. The Nationals outfielder will receive a seven-game suspension
for his serious lapse of judgment, although his victim, a 37-year-old male,
is very surprised by the suspension and wishes his assailant luck with the
appeal of the penalty.

Matt Stairs sets the career record for pinch-hit homeruns when he goes deep
off Ernesto Frieri in the eighth inning of a 6-5 loss in Milwaukee. The
two-run shot over the Miller Park right field fence, his twenty-first
round-tripper coming off the bench, moves the premier pinch-hitter ahead
of Cliff Johnson.

2011
The Padres retire Trevor Hoffman's No. 51 in a post-game ceremony to honor
baseball's all-time saves leader, who retired in the off-season after playing
18 big league seasons, 16 with San Diego. After he was acquired by the team
in a five-player deal in 1993, the right-handed reliever compiled 552 saves
of his 601 for the Friars.

2013
Ichiro Suzuki collects his 4,000th career hit to join Ty Cobb and Pete
Rose as the third professional baseball player to accomplish the feat. The
Yankee right fielder, who has compiled more hits during his 13 seasons in
the major leagues than any other player within the same amount of playing
time, started his career with the Orix BlueWave in Japan where he had a
total of 1,278 hits before joining the Mariners in 2001.
