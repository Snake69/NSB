1901
Umpire Bob Emslie becomes ill before the 2nd game of the Superbas-Phils twin
bill and Phils P Al Orth and Superbas C Jim McGuire fill in for him. However,
it is a close game, and Orth is needed as a PH in the 9th. Doc White then
becomes the 2nd umpire as Orth hits a single and scores a run. Brooklyn
holds on for a 3-2 win.

At Boston, Cy Young pitches a 6-0 shutout over visiting Milwaukee. Boston
(59-40) is a game behind the White Sox (60-39), but will lose 12 out of
their next 17 to drop out of contention.

1903
The NL-leading Pirates set an NL mark for an inning of inept fielding,
making 6 errors in the first inning, giving the Giants 7 runs toward a 13-7
win in the first of two games. Mathewson, with relief in the 6th inning,
coasts to his 23rd win. Deacon Phillippe wins the nitecap, 4-1, for the
Pirates to keep the Giants 5 games in back.

At Chicago, Boston's Buck Freeman is the first to hit a ball over the RF
score board, but the Boston Americans lose to the White Sox, 9-5.

1904
In a rain-shortened game in Pittsburgh, the Giants win 3-0, as Christy
Mathewson allows just 3 hits.

1905
The A's Rube Waddell strikes out 12 batters in 7 innings, but the effort
is wasted as the Browns and A's go 16 innings before the game is called at
3-3. Bobby Wallace has 5 hits.

1906
White Sox OF Patsy Dougherty leads the offense with a homer to CF as Chicago
beats New York, 4-1.

1907

a B (Boutles, P; Brown, C; Brain, 3B; Bridwell, SS; Burke, LF; Beaumont, CF;
Bates, RF; Tenney, 1B; Richey, 2B). The B's prevail, beating the Pirates, 9-8.

1908
Brooklyn collects 15 safeties off three Pirates pitchers and Harry McIntire
allows just 4 Buc hits for the 6-1 win. He follows Kaiser Wilhelm's 4-hitter
against the Buccaneers yesterday. Pittsburgh is now tied for first with
New York.

The A's Danny Murphy hits his second grand slam in a month as Philadelphia
beats Doc White and the White Sox, 6-1.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed

3-0 victory.

1909
The Browns and Tigers trade first baseman:  Tom Jones goes to Detroit for
Claude Rossman.

1912
In Washington, Walter Johnson wins his AL-record 15th straight, downing
Cleveland, 4-2. The Big Train is topped in the nitecap when Washington
hurler Jay Cashion tosses a 6-inning no-hitter, winning 2-0. The only base
runners reach on 2 errors by SS George McBride. Johnson's effort takes
1 hour 55 minutes, while Cashion's 6 innings finish in just 65 minutes.
The game is called to allow Cleveland to catch a train to Boston. Cashion
will win only 11 other games in his ML career.

1913
White Sox ace Jim Scott, on his way to a 20-20 record, shuts out Boston to
win, 1-0. The loser is rookie Fred Anderson, who will go 0-6, before going to
the FL next season. Patrolling CF is Edd Roush, in his major league debut,
the start of an unsuccessful 9-game trial with Chicago. Roush will play CF
tomorrow, his only 2 games in the Sox outfield. But the September 6, 1913
edition of The Sporting Life notes that Roush "is the only ball player who
carries two gloves with him. When he plays left field he throws right-handed
and wears his left-hand glove. When they shift him over to right field he
throws left-handed, and sports the right-handed glove." As asked by Bill
Deane, which glove does he wear when he plays CF?

The Phillies trade Cozy Dolan and cash to the Pirates for P Howie Camnitz
(6-17) and 3B Bobby Byrne. Camnitz, a 20-game winner the past two seasons,
will reach 20 losses this year, and then jump to the PittFeds for the
1914 season.

1914
The Braves' Dick Rudolph wins his 11th straight, stopping Pittsburgh,
6-3. Included in his win streak is a 4-3 10-inning victory over the Reds on
August 8. There is confusion in some record books about this game. Rudolph's
streak will be stopped in his next start on the 24th by Chicago.

1915
The White Sox obtain Joe Jackson from Cleveland in exchange for OF Braggo
Roth, OF Larry Chappell, P Ed Klepfer and $31,500. Roth will lead the AL

Victoria for $1200. Kelly is the nephew of Bill Lange, 1890s star of the
Chicago Nationals.

needs help because regular 1B Jake Daubert is hurt.

1919
Wichita OF Joe Wilhoit (Western League) fails to get a hit against Elam
Vangilder in a 5-2 win over Tulsa, ending a 69-game streak. During the
streak (which started June 14 and included 50 games with 2 or more hits) the
33-year-old collected 155 hits in 299 at-bats for a .505 batting average. The
previous record was 49 by Oakland's Jack Ness (Pacific Coast League) in
1915. Wilhoit draws a walk in his last at-bat. Coincidentally, the Red Sox
purchased Wilhoit's contract yesterday and he will report September 15,
Wilhoit's streak almost ended in games 62 and 63, a doubleheader in Omaha:
in the first game his only hit was an 11th inning HR; in game 2, after making
an out 3 times, he bunted to 3B. The Omaha third sacker, with his team leading
by a big margin, held the ball rather than throwing Wilhoiy out. "Graham's
sportsmanship drew forth the admiration of the crowd." (Wichita Eagle)

1920
The Friday Red Sox-Indians game in Boston is postponed because of Chapman's
funeral in Cleveland. It will be part of a Monday doubleheader.

After two minutes of silence at the start of the 5th inning, the White Sox
sweep a pair from the A's in Philadelphia. The Sox win the opener, 7-4,
and take the nitecap on a forfeit when the crowd surges on to the field
thinking a foul grounder had ended the game. Chicago is leading, 5-2,
at the time. The double win moves Chicago into a virtual tie with the Indians.

1921
The Tigers waive veteran Donie Bush to the Senators.

1923
At Comiskey Park, the Yanks are winning a laugher, 16-5, when a dog wanders
onto left field in the 9th inning. Babe Ruth briefly plays with the pup,
then tosses his mitt to chase it away. The dog promptly grabs the mitt and
takes off at the same moment that Sox rookie pitcher Paul Castner lofts a
fly to left. Babe casually catches the fly bare handed.

1924

the Cubs. Genewich wins the opener, 2-0, and Barnes the nitecap, 5-0.

1-0, win over the Indians. The victory puts the Senators back on top to stay.

1926
The Giants lose their 5th in 6 games, 6-2, in St. Louis. It is the Giants
3rd loss in a row to the Cards, giving St. Louis a momentary view from
atop the NL. In today's game, Frankie Frisch misses a sign that costs a
run. After the game, berated by John McGraw in front of the team, Frisch
buys a ticket to New York and leaves the team. Fined $500, McGraw's favorite,
and heir apparent, is through with the Giants.

1928
Art Shires of the White Sox strokes 4 hits, including a triple, in his
ML debut, to lead Chicago to a 6-4 win over the Red Sox. Red Faber is the

wins; his last loss came against Jess Haines, who wins today in relief. Jess'
last win was against Dazzy.

1931
At St. Louis, Gehrig hits his 33rd homer in the 4th to tie Ruth for the ML
lead, but the Babe answers in the 9th with his 34th, a grand slam over RF
roof, to give the Yanks a 7-3 win over the Browns. Lefty Gomez almost has
New York's first shutout of the season, but he weakens in the 9th.

Tony Freitas, who will win 342 minor league games, is let out of jail to
pitch for Sacramento (PCL) against the Missions. He wins, and then returns
to finish a 5-day sentence for speeding.

1932
After losing the opener to Chicago, 6-4, the A's take game 2 by a 14-8
score. Jimmie Foxx helps with a 500-ft homer off Ted Lyons that carries
over the CF wall at Shibe Park and well past a neighboring factory building.

1933
Powered by Turkey Stearnes' 41st HR, the Chicago American Giants (Negro
League) defeat the Nashville Elite Giants in a twin bill for their 28th
consecutive victory.

1938
At Shibe Park, Lou Gehrig hits a first-inning grand slam, the 23rd and
last of his career for a still-standing record. It comes off Buck Ross in
an 11-3 victory over the A's. Larrupin' Lou ends the day with 6 RBIs.

The Cubs commit 6 errors in losing to the league-leading Pirates, 5-2,
at Wrigley Field.

The East-West Negro League All-Star game at Comiskey Park draws 30,000
fans. The East scores 3 in the first off Willie Cornelius, but Hilton Smith
and Double Duty Radcliffe hold the East sluggers to one run after that. Neil
Robinson hits a 3-run inside-the-park homer for the West as they win, 5-4.

Cleveland Indian catchers Frank Pytlak and Hank Helf break the all-time
altitude mark by catching baseballs dropped from the 706-foot Cleveland
Terminal Tower. The spheres, dropped from the 52nd floor of the second-tallest
building in the world, is said to travel at an average speed of 140 mph
during its descent. In the afternoon game, Cleveland beats Chicago, 8-2,
behind Mel Harder. Monty Stratton takes the loss as Jeff Heath scores 5 runs.

McCormick - to defeat the Giants, 3-2.

1941
Larry MacPhail stages a fashion show before a Ladies Day crowd at Ebbets
Field. Such promotions, as well as the Dodgers pennant race, will push the
home gate to over one million fans. The Dodgers also pick up Larry French
for the waiver price of $7,500. The Cubs consider the amiable lefty over
the hill after he hurt his thumb and slipped to 5-14. French will go 15-4
next year for the Dodgers. On the 25th Brooklyn will pick up Augie Galan
for cash from the Cubs.

In Boston, the Cards suffer another injury when OF Terry Moore is
beaned behind the ear by a pitch from Art Johnson, and carried off on a
stretcher. He'll be released from a Boston hospital in 10 days and flown
to St. Louis, where he'll be hospitalized for several more days. He won't
return to the lineup until September 14. However, the Cards slice the
Dodger lead to 1 1/2 games by sweeping a pair, 2-0 and 3-2. Ernie White
(15-4) wins the opener and Howie Pollet (21-3 at Houston) follows with a
4-hitter in his ML debut.

Elmer Riddle (14-2) and Johnny Vander Meer each toss shutouts for the Reds
over the Phillies. Cincy wins 2-0 and 3-0.

wins the nitecap, 3-1, to stop the skid.

1945
Dodger shortstop Tommy Brown becomes the youngest player (17 years, 8 months
and 14 days) in major league history to hit a homerun. The round-tripper by
'Buckshot', who started his career as a 16-year-old high school student,
will be the only run Brooklyn scores off 30-year-old Pirates southpaw
Preacher Roe, who goes the distance in the 11-1 rout of the home team at
Ebbets Field. The Dodgers commit seven errors.

Detroit's Hal Newhouser shuts out the A's, 4-0, for his 20th win of the
year. Greenberg has his 15 game hitting streak stopped, but Roy Cullenbine
and Doc Cramer add HRs.

Washington shuts out Cleveland twice as Marino Pieretti wins 7-0 and Alex
Carrasquel follows with a 6-0 shutout.

1946
The Pirates vote on whether to accept the Guild as their bargaining
agent. The vote is 15-3 against, with 10 abstentions, effectively killing
the Guild. They then blank the Dodgers, 10-0, behind Strincevich to cut
the Flatbush lead to a half-game.

It's "Appreciation Day" in Boston as the Braves give away a Packard and a
Ford before the game, then lose to the Cardinals, 4-1. Howie Pollet wins
his 15th. Lolly Hopkins, a die-hard fan from Providence, RI, draws the
winning tickets for the cars.

In Washington, the attraction is not the teams, but the pre-game exhibition
of Bob Feller pitching to an army clocking-device to time his fastball. An
extra 20,000 fans show up to see Feller, who had not been informed about
it; he asks for and gets $700 from Griffith. Feller's fastball is clocked
at 98.6 (breaking Yankees hurler Atley Donald's 1939 speed record of 94.7
mph) crossing the plate (107 mph leaving his hand) on 4 pitches; his 5th
pitch shatters the wooden frame of the device. Taking the mound Feller then
strikes out 7 in a losing cause, as the Indians commit 4 errors. Knuckleballer
Mickey Haefner is the winner, 5-4.

1947
The Boston Braves hit a million attendance for the first time in their
history and the fans get their money's worth in the 34-hit slugfest. The
Pirates notch 20 to outslug the Braves, 16-10. Russell with a triple,
double and 3 singles and Bloodworth with 4 singles lead the Buc shots.

1948
The Indians draw a record 78,382 for the largest crowd to attend a night
game. The Indians go on to beat the Chicago White Sox, 1-0, at Memorial

loser. Besides Paige, Gene Bearden, Sam Zoldak and Bob Lemon fired shutouts.

1952

awaiting discharge, makes his ML debut. He allows 5 hits against the Braves
in a 7-2 win, a 7 1/2 inning game ended by rain.

The Bradford Phillies and the Batavia Clippers of the Pony League play
the first double no-hit game in league history. In the 1st game of the

Jim Mitchell answers with one of his own in the night cap but Bradford
still wins again, 1-0.

1953
Carl Erskine shuts out the Giants, 10-0, for Brooklyn's 13th consecutive
win and his 2nd successive shutout over the Polo Grounders. The Dodgers
are 9 up on the Braves.

5-2. Roberts had beaten the Bucs 15 straight times beginning on August 26,
1950. The winner is 19-year-old Jim Waugh.

Bill Veeck brings the Browns to Baltimore to play an exhibition game
against the minor-league Orioles. Eastern Shore attorney Clarence W. Miles,

Redlegs win, 3-2. Alex Grammas participates in 5 of the DPs.

Giants lefty Don Liddle shuts out the Pirates to win, 4-0, with all the New
York scoring coming on Don Mueller's grand slam in the 5th inning. Willie
Mays hits safely in his 21st straight game, but he'll go hitless tomorrow.

1955
The Tigers shell Bob Keegan, but the White Sox rally to edge Detroit,
8-7. Nellie Fox and Jim Rivera pace the attack with 4 hits apiece, while Chico
Carrasquel adds a homer. George Kell drives in 5 runs for the Bengals. The
loss leaves the White Sox (71-46) in 2nd place with the Indians (73-48),
and a game in back of New York (74-47).

The Yankees stay a game ahead of the White Sox and Cleveland, by clipping
the Orioles, 3-2. Lefty Bill Wight allows just one hit till the 4th, before
allowing a walk, single, ground out and double. Paul Richards then brings
in George Zuverink to pitch to Elston Howard, moving Wight to 1B replacing
Triandos. Howard doubles in 2 runs, Zuverink gets the next 2 hitters before
Wight returns to the mound and pitches shutout ball the rest of the way. Tommy
Byrne wins his 12th game against 3 losses.

1956

1957
At Comiskey Park, using a new slow delivery, 35-year-old Bob Keegan of the
White Sox pitches a 6-0 no-hitter over Washington, walking just 2. It's the
White Sox' first no-hitter in twenty years (Bill Dietrich in 1937), and the
first no-no thrown at night in franchise history. Chuck Stobbs loses his
16th game enroute to a league-leading 20 losses. The Sox lose the opener,
5-4, to the last place Senators, but pick up a half-game on New York,
now 7 games ahead of Chicago.

Yankee Bob Turley pitches a 2-hitter against Kansas City, but loses 1-0,
to former Yank Ralph Terry. Both A's hits come in the 6th when Tim Thompson
drives in Held with a single. Thompson won yesterday's 1-0 game with a
single. Mantle suffers a severe gash to his left leg that will hamper his
run for the Triple Crown. The cause is attributed to any number of reasons,
and only years later does the truth come out: after losing in golf to Tom
Sturdivant, Mantle is so angry he bashes his putter over a tree limb and
it comes around and gouges his leg almost to the bone. He will hit just
.268 with one homer the rest of the year.

1958
Phils 3B Willie Jones hits a pair of 3-run HRs, a double and a single
and drives in 8 runs as the Phils beat the Cardinals, 12-2. Musial has 2
hits including a double, and is now tied with Mel Ott with 2,165 on the
all-time list.

Out of catchers, the Cubs put left-handed 1B Dale Long behind the plate in
the opener against the Pirates. He is the first lefty backstop since 1905
when Homer Hildebrand donned the tools of ignorance. The Cubs lose, 4-2,
then win the nightcap, 5-1, with Long back at 1B.

1959
The A's Bob Cerv hits 3 HRs in an 11-10 loss to Boston. The Sox out-hit

batters to collect 2,000 walks. The Splendid Splinter also clouts HRs 514
and 515 in game 1, an 8-6 Boston win. The O's win the nitecap, 6-0, behind
Brown, but drop into 3rd place, 2 games behind the 1st-place Yankees.

1961
Philadelphia's modern NL-record 23-game losing streak ends when John
Buzhardt goes the distance to beat Milwaukee, 7-4, in the 2nd of 2 games.
Buzhardt had also been the winning pitcher in the Phillies' last victory
prior to the start of the losing streak, on July 28 against the San Francisco
Giants. Today's win snaps Milwaukee's 10-game win streak. The Phils lost
game 1, 5-2. Seventeen of the losses came on the road.

The Cubs and Pirates tie an NL record by playing their 3rd straight
extra-inning game. The Cubs take this one, 1-0. Chicago wins two of the
three 11-inning games.

The Twins outslug the Angels to win, 9-7, and do it with two homers from
two pitchers - a 1st in the AL and the last time it happens in the 20th
century. Lennie Green starts the offense with a leadoff HR, the first
of 2 he hits, and starter Jack Kralick homers. Al Schroll who pitches 4+
innings for the win, also homers. Earl Averill hits a pair for the Haloes.

At Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, both Mantle (46th) and Maris (49th) homer
in the twinbill sweep, 6-0 and 5-2. Mantle's first-inning three-run homer,
and Maris' in the 3rd inning make it easy for Ralph Terry. In the nitecap,
Bill Skowron hits his 21st in the 2nd inning. In the 6th, after Bell allows
a single and then hits Gardner and Maris, Mantle collects his 101st walk
to force home a run.

The Tigers remain 3 games behind New York by sweeping a pair from the visiting
Red Sox, 6-1 and 7-6. Lary wins his 18th in the opener, with the help of
5 DPs. Boston pulls off 3 DPs of their own. Fox, in relief of Bunning,
is the game 2 winner.

Satchel Paige is the big attraction, winning pitcher and MVP in the Negro
American League All-Star game before 7,245 fans at Yankee Stadium. Paige
pitches the first three innings for the West giving up no runs and allowing
a scratch single to Fred Green. It is the only hit the East gets, as Don
Poindexter and Dick Hemphill allow no hits in their three-inning stints as
the West wins, 7-1. Governor Nelson Rockefeller tosses out the first pitch,
a throw with the same speed and trajectory as Paige's hesitation pitch
thrown for a strike to Gideon Jarvis.

1962
At Crosley Field, Frank Robinson connects for a grand slam in the 10th
inning as the Reds defeat the Dodgers, 7-3.

1963
Mets 22-year-old rookie Grover Powell beats the Phils with a 4-0 shutout in
his first ML start. In his next start he'll be hit on the cheek by a line
drive off the bat of Pittsburgh's Donn Clendenon and never win another game.

For the second time in two weeks, Don Blasingame is the only thing between
the Senators and a no-hitter. Blasingame's single off the A's Moe Drabowsky
is the only hit for the Nats in a 9-0 game-1 loss. The A's complete the
sweep with a 7-5 victory in game 2. Dave Wickersham is the winner.

1964
On the New York team bus following a 5-0 White Sox win, Phil Linz begins to
play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on his harmonica. Due to a misunderstanding
caused by Mickey Mantle misinforming his teammate that their manager Yogi
Berra had asked for the harmonica to be played louder, a confrontation
occurs on the back of the team bus between the skipper, who had actually
asked for the music to stop, and utility player Phil Linz. Berra slaps the
instrument out of Linz' hands when he continues playing. Some believe the
well-publicized incident fired up the third-place team, who had just lost
four consecutive games to the White Sox in Chicago, to a successful pennant
run, but may have reinforced the perception Berra had lost control of the
team leading to his dismissal after game 7 of the World Series.

Orioles LF Boog Powell fractures his right wrist in a collision with the
outfield fence in Baltimore's loss at Boston. He will be sidelined until
September 5th.

1965
Eddie Mathews hits his 28th HR as the Braves win, 4-3, at Pittsburgh. The
duo of Mathews and Hank Aaron, 1954-65, becomes the top HR tandem in ML
history, passing the Ruth-Gehrig total of 772 HRs while playing together.

1967
In the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park, switch-hitter Reggie
Smith, in an 12-2 rout of the Angels, becomes the first Red Sox player
to blast a homerun from each side of the plate. Until today, the feat had
never been accomplish by any Fenway Park batter. In the night cap, the Red
Sox rally from an eight-run deficit to beat the Angels, 9-8. The big blow
is Carl Yastrzemski's fifth-inning three-run homer, his second of the day,
having gone deep with two men on in the first game.

Within 24 hours, Alvin Dark (52-69) is fired, rehired, and fired again as
manager of the A's. Luke Appling becomes interim manager.

The Tigers take a pair from the Indians, winning 4-2 and 4-0, as career
reliever John Hiller tosses a shutout in his first start. Al Kaline homers
in each game.

1969
With an 8-5 win at Philadelphia, the Dodgers take first place in the NL
West by a half game.

1971
Ferguson Jenkins wins his 20th, beating Houston 3-2. The win pulls the Cubs
to 4 1/2 behind Pittsburgh. But following 2 losses to Houston, Leo Durocher
and the players will square off in a clubhouse meeting on the 23rd. Durocher
accuses Santo of demanding that the team give him a day, and the third sacker
has to be restrained from going after Leo. Leo will finally lip an "I quit,"
but stay on through the season in a frosty relationship with the team.

1972
Striking out 14, Don Wilson pitches the Astros to a 3-1 win over the
Phils. Greg Luzinski accounts for the lone Quaker run with a homer. Still
without a win this year, Ken Reynolds absorbs his 11th loss.

The Angels score 9 runs in the 4th inning but Detroit counters with 8 runs
in the 6th to win the wild affair, 11-9. Aurelio Rodriguez touches off the
comeback with a double and ends the scoring with another extra base hit,
a 3-run homer. In between are 6 singles and a sac fly.

1973
In New York, the Reds score 5 runs in the 16th to beat the Mets, 8-3. Each
team scores in the 13th.

1974
In an 18-8 rout of the Cubs, the Dodgers collect 24 hits and set a club
record with 48 total bases including Davey Lopes' three homeruns, double
and single. The Dodger second baseman's 15 total bases is the most ever
for a leadoff hitter.

At Anaheim Stadium, Nolan Ryan whiffs 19 batters in a game for the second
time in eight days and the third time this season. The Angel right-hander's
