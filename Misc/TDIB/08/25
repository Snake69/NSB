1902
At Baltimore, the Orioles pummel the Chicago White Sox, 21-6. The O's are led
by Jimmy Williams, who collects 6 hits - 4 singles, a double and a triple -
off Clark Griffith and Dummy Leitner. With 21 triples, Williams will lead
the AL for the 3rd time in 4 years. Herm McFarland scores 5 runs for the O's.

Ban Johnson announces the AL's intention to have a New York team in 1903,
with Clark Griffith as manager. The Baltimore franchise will be moved.

1903
The White Sox beat Detroit, 2-0, as Bill Donovan absorbs his 7th loss in
which his Tigers are shut out. Five are by an AL record 1-0 scores.

1906
The Giants, trailing the Reds 3-2 after 6 innings, jump on Bob Wicker for
6 runs in the 7th and win going away, 8-3. One of the 6 hits in the 6th is
a double by Christy Mathewson, the winning pitcher.

Washington sweeps a doubleheader from the White Sox, 5-4 and 4-3, to end
Chicago's win streak at 19 games. In the opener, Ed Walsh, who relieves
in the 7th, blows a 4-2 lead in the 9th by giving up 5 straight hits and
3 runs. Charles Smith is the winner. The Sox jumped from 4th to first on
the streak.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1908
The Giants win their 3rd in a row from Pittsburgh, stopping Nick Maddox,
5-3. Maddox had won 8 in a row. Doc Crandall is the winner. Larry Doyle
triples in the 3rd inning, then steps off the bag while chatting with Buc
third sacker Tommy Leach. Gibson's throw from home nails Doyle.

1909
Christy Mathewson stops the Pirates, 3-2, on five hits to notch his 20th
victory of the season. It is the 7th season in a row that Matty's hit 20
wins. Nick Maddox takes the loss for the leading Bucs.

1910
In the 12th inning at Brooklyn, Pittsburgh's Bobby Byrne doubles, steals
3B, and then steals home to beat Brooklyn, 4-3. This is the NL's 1st 20th
Century's extra-inning steal of home.

At St. Louis, the Athletics' Danny Murphy hits for the cycle, but it is
not enough as Philadelphia loses, 9-6.

1911
The Giants take over sole possession of the lead with a 3-2 win over
Pittsburgh. New York will remain atop the NL for the rest of the way.

Red Sox lefty Smoky Joe Wood tops the St. Louis Browns, 3-2, for his 20th win.

At Detroit, Washington pastes the Tigers, 16-2, in game one. In an attempt
to change their luck, Detroit bats first in game 2 and emerges with a 7-6 win.

1913
Carl Weilman become the first major leaguer to strike out six consecutive
times in a single game. The Browns hurler accomplishes the dubious feat as
the losing pitcher in a 3-0 defeat to the A's at Sportsman's Park.

Ty Cobb steals home in the 5th inning to tie the game and his throw home
in the 8th helps the Tigers edge the Senators, 6-5.

The Athletics defeat the Browns, 3-0, as Eddie Plank strikes out 11.

Braves vet Art Devlin slaps the game-winning hit in the 9th for Boston and
gets rewarded by manager Stallings by being sent down to Rochester, never
to return to the ML. His .229 average might have had something to do with it.

1914
The A's score 9 runs to back Rube Bressler's shutout of the Browns in the
first of two games. Teammate Herb Pennock then follows with a 1-0 shutout.

1915
The Giants release Rube Marquard to Toronto (IL) but the veteran pitcher
refuses to go to the minors. He works out his own deal and is signed by
Wilbert Robinson and the Dodgers. Rube will post a 13-6 record next season
for Uncle Robby.

The Red Sox win, 2-1, in 13 innings to sweep the Tigers and solidify their
hold on 1st place. Boston has now won 7 straight and 19 of 21.

1916
Dick Rudolph of the Braves beats the Cubs, 1-0, matching his teammate
Lefty Tyler with two 1-0 games in a month. No Brave will match it until
Greg Maddux in 2001.

1917
Behind Jeff Pfeffer and Rube Marquard, the Dodgers apply a doubleheader
whitewash to the Cardinals, winning 12-0 and 4-0. In game 1, the Dodgers
have 2 bases-loaded triples to tie the NL mark. Brooklyn's Hy Myers is
thrown out 3 times trying to steal in one game by the Cards, the 2nd player
this year to be thrown out 3 times in a game. Not till Rodney Scott in 1979
will another NL runner be caught stealing 3 times.

1918
The Cubs clinch the NL pennant over the idle Giants by splitting with the
Dodgers. Thanks to shoddy fielding by Brooklyn, Roy Walker improves his
record to 1-3, winning the opener, 5-3. Brooklyn takes the nitecap, 2-1,
behind the 5-hit pitching of Columbia George Smith.

At Boston, the Reds top the Braves, 4-2, in 13 innings. In February, Lee
Magee will confess that he and Hal Chase each bet $500 for their team,
the Reds, to lose this game. Ironically, Magee scores the winning run when
Edd Roush hits a two-run homer.

Boston Red Sox president George Frazee says the WS schedule arrangements
are not acceptable and he will refuse to abide by them if the Sox win
the pennant. The schedule calls for the first three games in Chicago, and
Frazee says this puts his team at a disadvantage. "It is not only unfair
to the Boston club, but an insult to the Boston fans ... The schedule as
given out by Mr. [Ban] Johnson will necessitate the passing up of both the
Saturday and Sunday dates, which I think is a big mistake," says Frazee.

1919
The Red Sox close out their road trip with a 5-4 win over the Tigers. Ruth
hits #23, his 4th homer in 3 days, to lead Boston.

1920
At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees edge the Indians, 4-3, on Wally Pipp's
2-run inside-the-park homerun.

1921
With Cleveland waltzing to a 15-1 win over the Yankees, NY hurler Harry
Harper, pitching in the 8th, plunks OF Charles Jamieson in the ribs, Larry
Gardner in the arm, and Steve O'Neill in the back. O'Neill throws the ball
back at Harper and precipitates a bench clearing brawl. New York OF Bob
Meusel contributes 4 errors in the game. The Tribe takes over 1st place
from the Yankees.

In a 4-2 win at Boston, the Cards' Austin McHenry hits a ball off the
LF fence, the first ball to reach the wall. No one has topped it in left
yet. On August 16th Walt Cruise hit one into the RF jury box, just the 2nd
ball to go over the fence since 1915. Ray Walker is the winning pitcher today.

1922
You can't blame it on the wind as one of the most poorly pitched ML games
ever played takes place in Chicago. The Cubs edge the Phils, 26-23, in
a game that features 51 hits, 23 walks and 10 errors. The Phils have the
bases loaded in the 9th when the game ends, making a total of 16 left on
base; the Cubs leave 9. When the Cubs score 14 runs in the 4th to take a
25-6 lead, OF Marty Callaghan bats 3 times (a since tied record), getting
2 hits and striking out. Modern ML records are set or tied for total runs
(49, by two teams) and hits, most players scoring runs (Phils, 13), most
players scoring 2+ runs (Cubs, 9), and most plate appearances (66, by
the Phils). The 14-run inning ties the Yankees' mark of July 6, 1920. The
Phils add a run in the 4th to make the two-team total of 15 a record for
the inning, as is the 2nd inning total of 13 - ten from the Cubs side and
3 from the Phils. Cliff Heathcote of the Cubs sets a modern NL record by
reaching base 7 times in the 9-inning game. Hack Miller helps run up the
Chicago total with 3-run homers in the 2nd and 4th innings. His first blast
is just the 2nd homer to reach the centerfield scoreboard, located at ground
level in Cubs Park ... Hornsby hit the first last year. A team-record 13
players score runs for the Phils. Tony Kaufmann is the winner over Jimmy
Ring in the game that lasts a surprisingly short 3:01.

In the first of a doubleheader before a sold-out Polo Grounds, the Browns
beat the Yankees, 3-1, behind Urban Shocker. Waite Hoyt is the loser,
but stops Ken Williams' hit streak at 28 consecutive games. George Sisler
hits in his 24th straight game. In game 2, the Yankees jump to a 2-0 lead
on Ruth's 2-run triple, then extend it to 6-1 behind Joe Bush. The Browns
close to 6-5, but that is it.

1924
Walter Johnson hurls his 6th shutout of the year, a 7-inning rain-shortened
no-hitter against the Browns, winning by a score of 2-0. For the Nats,
it is their 9th win in a row and they are now even with New York. The
scheduled nitecap is postponed.

1925
Despite being out-homered 4-1, the Cubs outscore the Phillies, 19-10 on 22
hits. Seven players have 2 or more hits. The lone homer for Chicago is a
9th-inning grand slam by Mandy Brook.

The Indians top the A's, 4-3, with the help of a triple play in the 2nd
inning. The play goes 4-2-6, with Spurgeon starting it with a tag and a
throw to Luke Sewell who throws back to his brother Joe.

The Tigers top the Red Sox, 14-4, and would have scored more except for
an unusual unassisted DP pulled off by Sox catcher Al Stokes in the 7th
in which he tags out two Detroit runners. With Johnny Bassler on second
and Fred Haney on first, Topper Rigney hits a long fly to center. Ira
Flagstead runs it down but drops it. Bassler holds up until the ball
hits the ground, but Haney, running hard all the way, is nearly to second
when Bassler starts running. Haney slows down and rounds 3B just behind
Bassler. Meanwhile, Flagstead throws the ball to SS Jack Rothrock who
relayes the ball to Stokes. As the Washington Post (1/19/1926) states,
"The two Tygers, looking over their shoulders, saw the ball coming and hit
the dust simultaneously. Stokes stood his ground, and with one sweep of his
arm, tagged them both before their spikes hit the rubber. Not to be outdone,
the umpire shot both arms upward, indicating the double play."

1926
With a 4-3 win over Boston, the Cardinals regain first place in the NL,
but the next day the Pirates retake the high ground. The five games with
Pittsburgh will attract 113,113 to Sportsman's Park.

1928
At Boston, Hack Wilson hits 2 homers to help Percy Jones hand Braves'
rookie Ed Brandt one of his league-leading 21 losses. Cubs win, 7-3. It's
the 6th time this year that Hack's connected for 2 in a game.

Pete Alexander allows a Philadelphia run in the first and that's it, as
the Cards' veteran wins, 2-1 in 10 innings. It is Alex' 14th victory.

1929
The second largest crowd ever to pack the Reds' ballpark - 35,432 - watches
their team split a pair with the pennant-bound Cubs. The Reds win the opener,
6-3, behind Red Lucas' 17th victory, while Guy Bush wins his 18th in the
nitecap, 10-1.

At the Polo Grounds, fans are able to hear the calls of home plate ump
Cy Rigler, who is wired for sound, a first in ML history. Wearing a mike,
wearing metal-plated shoes, and standing on a flat metal sheet, Cy's calls
are broadcast over speakers. The Giants top the Pirates, 10-5.

After three straight shutouts by Browns hurlers - Gray, Blaeholder
and Crowder - the Yankees break their 32-inning scoreless streak with a
4th-inning homer by Babe Ruth. St. Louis still wins, 3-2.

1930
Tommy Bridges walks 12 Brownies, but Detroit still beats St. Louis, 7-5.

1931
At Chicago, the Yankees record their first shutout of the season when Herb
Pennock blanks the White Sox, 6-0. Ben Chapman has a good day with a triple,
single, 2 runs scored and his 50th and 51st stolen bases of the year. In
addition, he beats the Sox' Carl Reynolds in a pre-game 100-yard dash.

1933
In the first of 2 games at Ebbets Field, Sam Leslie singles in the winning run
in the bottom of the 9th to give the Dodgers a 4-3 win over the Reds. The hit
comes off Red Lucas, who bats 7th in the lineup, collecting 2 hits. Suffering
from a charley horse (as noted by David Vincent), Dodger 2B Tony Cuccinello
sits out for the first time since July of 1930 (when he was playing for
the Reds), ending a consecutive playing streak of more than 500 games -
the exact number isn't known. Tony's was the longest active streak in the
NL. Hack Wilson replaces Cuccinello at 2B for the doubleheader, and makes
two errors in the game 2, also a 4-3 Brooklyn win. Boom Boom Beck and Ownie
Carroll are the winning pitchers.

1934
In Washington, Schoolboy Rowe, Detroit's sensational rookie pitcher, defeats
the Senators, 4-2, for his 16th win in a row, tying the AL record held by
Walter Johnson, Joe Wood and Lefty Grove. Rowe allows 9 hits in 9 innings,
and is behind 2-1 entering the 9th. He wins the game with a 9th inning single.

At St. Louis, the Cards build a 5-0 lead over New York and Carl Hubbell,
but in the end the Giants come out winners. Dizzy Dean, who pitched a
shutout yesterday, throws 3 innings of relief, gives up 5 hits and a walk,
and is charged with the 7-6 loss. Schumacher gets the victory.

1935
In the first game of four straight doubleheaders with the White Sox, Earle
Combs of the Yankees collides with teammate Red Rolfe on a fly ball and
suffers a severe shoulder injury. It will contribute to his decision to
retire at the end of the season. The Sox win, 6-3, then lose the nitecap,
5-1, as Gehrig hits his 24th.

1936
The Braves establish a new major league record hitting seven doubles in one
inning. The two-bagger barrage occurs in the first frame of a 20-3 rout of
the Cardinals at Sportsman's Park. The Cardinals announce that they have
put Paul Dean on the voluntary retirement list. Dean has been suffering from
a sore arm. To replace him, the Cards call up Cotton Pippen from Sacramento.

The Giants come from behind to win their 13th straight, defeating Cincinnati,
6-5, and taking over first place.

1937
Cleveland's Bob Feller strikes out 16 Red Sox, one less than his own AL
record, in an 8-1 victory at home.

The Giants cut the Cubs lead to 2 games with a twinbill sweep at the Polo
Grounds. New York wins, 8-7 in 11 innings, and 4-2. The Giants rally for
5 runs in the 9th to tie in game 1.

Roxy Lawson allows 12 hits and 6 walks but wins his 16th when he drives in the
winning run with a bunt single in the 9th of a 6-5 conquest of Boston. Rudy
York belts another homer, a three-run shot off George Caster. For the 2nd
time this season, Tiger outfielders have no assists. Tiger 3B Marv Owens
ties a ML record with 9 assists.

1938
St. Louis Browns George McQuinn's 34-game hitting string is stopped 7 short
of George Sisler's AL record. McQuinn has a single in the first game, an 8-5
win over the A's, then is collared in the 4-1 nitecap loss. No one but Sisler
and Cobb, both twice, have had longer hit streaks in the 20th century so far.

1939
At St. Louis, the Yankees sweep the Browns, 11-0 and 8-2. Red Rolfe scores
for the Yankees in both games giving him 18 straight in which he's tallied
a run. In the 18 games he's scored a total of 30 runs. The Browns will end
the season with a dismal home record of 18-59. The .234 winning percentage
is the worst home record in the 20th century.

1940
Lefty Tom George, who started in pro ball in 1907, returns to the mound for
York (Interstate League) at age 54, and wins 3-2. He had been inactive for
5 years.

After losing, 7-2, to the Browns in game 1 of a twinbill, the Red Sox
explode in the 2nd game for 11 runs in the 6th inning. Jimmie Foxx hits
his 3rd grand slam of the year in the inning, connecting off the Browns'
Emil Bildilli. The game is called after 7 innings, with the Sox ahead, 17-3.

1942
The largest night crowd in St. Louis history watch two aces deal, the
Dodgers' Whit Wyatt and the Cardinals' Mort Cooper, go scoreless for 12
innings. Both teams score in the 13th, and the Cards win it in the 14th,
2-1, on Walker Cooper's solo shot. The win by Mort Cooper cuts the Dodgers'
lead over St. Louis to 5 1/2 games.

1944
In the 4th inning, Tiger SS Joe Hoover singles off Browns pitcher Denny
Galehouse, then steals 2B. A grounder moves him to 3B and, with Eddie Mayo
on 1B with a walk, the two engineer a double steal. Hoover's swipe of home
holds up as the only run of the 1-0 game. Dizzy Trout allows just 4 hits
in winning his 21st of the season.

1945
The Tigers' Joe Hoover will swipe only 19 bases in his career, but the most
valuable one comes today. On the front end of a 3rd-inning double steal,
Hoover steals home against the Browns for the game's only run.

1946
The Yankees become the first major league team to draw over two million
paying patrons at home when 42,908 fans show up at the Bronx ballpark to
watch the Bombers drop a 7-2 decision to Detroit's Hal Newhouser. Today's
crowd brings the season total to 2,027,087, three-quarters of a million
more than the previous American League record also set by New York when
the team played at the Polo Grounds in 1920.

Tied for first with St. Louis, the Dodgers open a 4 games series with the
Cards by splitting a doubleheader. The Dodgers take the opener, 2-1, handing
Howie Pollet his 1st loss in 3 weeks. The Cardinals take the nitecap, 14-8.

In the first of 2 at Fenway, Boston's Boo Ferriss tops the Indians' Red
Embree, 2-1, in Boo's final decision at home. His record at Fenway is 13-0
this season. Homeruns account for all the scoring as Doerr hits 2 and Jordan
hits one. There are no homers in the nitecap as the Sox complete the sweep,
13-6. Johnson is the winner in relief with starter Allie Reynolds taking
the loss.

In Cincinnati, the Reds prize rookie Grady Hatton fractures his right knee
cap in the dugout runway and is out for the season. Hatton runs into a
brick wall trying to avoid spiking a girl seeking autographs.

1947
The Cubs' Billy Jurges, shifted from coach to active player 2 days ago,
smashes a 2-run homer in the 10th to give Chicago a 9-7 win over the
Giants. Also homering are Scheffing and Pafko for Chicago and Marshall (31)
and Thomson (24) for the Giants.

Future major leaguer Rocky Nelson is married at home plate at Lynchburg
City Stadium of the (class A) Lynchburg Hillcats. His bride is the former

1951
Before 66,110 at Cleveland, Mantle belts an opposite field 2-run homer off
Mike Garcia to help the Yankees win, 7-3. New York (77-46) moves to a game
in back of the Tribe.

In a rain-shortened contest, the Dodgers come out on the short end of a
5-1 decision with the Cubs. Rookie Bob Kelly is the winner in 8 innings
as Cavarretta drives in 4 runs. Chicago might have scored more except for
Furillo's 2 assists, bringing his total to 25. Brooklyn leads by 7.

Stan Musial homers to give the Cards a 3-1 lead over the Giants, but rain
washes out the game after Thomson hits his 24th, in the 3rd.

1952
In a 1-0 win over the Yankees in Yankee Stadium, Virgil Trucks of the Detroit
Tigers pitches his 2nd no-hitter of the season. The no-hitter is in doubt
for 3 innings when a play made by SS Johnny Pesky in the 3rd inning is under
debate. The official scorer, John Drebinger, records it as an error when
Pesky has trouble getting a ball hit by Phil Rizzuto out of his glove. Dan
Daniel of The New York World Telegram convinces Drebinger that it cannot
be ruled an error because the ball was stuck in the fielder's glove, and
Rizzuto is awarded a hit. In the 6th inning, with Trucks not having given
up another hit, Drebinger calls Pesky in the dugout from the press box,
and the SS says that he should be given the error rather than Rizzuto the
hit. The call is changed again, and Trucks' no-hitter is preserved. Trucks'
record is now 5-15. He'll finish the season at 5-19.

Ken Raffensberger hurls his 5th shutout of the year beating the Giants' Larry
Jansen, 3-0. It is Jansen's first loss to the Reds after 12 straight wins.

League) pitches his 3rd no-hitter of the season, beating Bristol, 3-0.

1954

yesterday and 13-2 today. They have hit 38 in 18 games with Cincy. Gil
Hodges of the Dodgers has 2 homers today, as does Rube Walker, to knock in
100 runs for the 6th consecutive season. Furillo, with a homer, drives in
5 runs, and Walker 4. Billy Loes wins his 8th straight as the Dodgers move
to 3 1/2 games behind New York.

1956
Prior to the Old Timer's Game at Yankee Stadium, shortstop Phil Rizzuto is
asked to consult with general manager George Weiss and manager Casey Stengel
concerning a player move necessitated by reacquiring Enos Slaughter off
waivers from the A's. After making several suggestions about who should be
cut from the squad, the veteran infielder is told by Weiss he is the player
about to be let go. Rizzuto will be 38 next month, though years later he'll
reveal he shaved a year and was really born in 1917. Through the instigation
of Ballantine Beer, Rizzuto will be in the announcing booth next season,
replacing Jim Woods. The White Sox top the Yanks, 4-2. Mantle has a homer,
but his throwing error allows the go-ahead run to score.

1957
The Braves top the Phillies, 7-3, behind Warren Spahn. The ace left hander
posts his 219th career win and cracks his 18th career homer, good for 6th
(tie with Schoolboy Rowe) on the career list. The Braves are also paced
by the hitting of Bob Hazle, who contributes two 3-run HRs and a single in
the win. Since being recalled from Wichita, "Hurricane" Hazle is hitting .526.

A baseball game is played in Little America, Antarctica (as reported by

the Pirates.

1961

in a game called after 8 innings because of rain. The win keeps the Tigers
2 games ahead of the Yankees.

In the Orioles' 5-2 win over the Twins, Oriole Dave Phillips sets a ML
record for pinch hits. His swinging bunt down the 3B line is his 23rd hit,
breaking the record set by the Giants' Sam Leslie in 1932. Phillips is 23
for 63 this season.

1962
Winning for the 18th time in 21 games - over Houston, 7-6 - the Reds move
within 3 games of first place. Joey Jay wins his 20th game.

Pirates players call off a threatened strike. They had objected to
a rained-out game being rescheduled as a night game the day before a
doubleheader.

1963
Cleveland batters suffer an AL-record 27 strikeouts in a doubleheader (24
innings) split against the Red Sox. The 44 strikeouts for both teams are
also an AL record, with Dick Stuart chipping in with 6. Stuart now has 123
for the season surpassing Jimmie Foxx' Sox record of 119. Bill Monbouquette
fans 11 Indians in the opener and Bob Heffner 12 more in the nitecap,
but the Tribe still manages a split, winning 2-1 after an 8-3 loss.

1964
Whitey Ford (13-5) wins his first game in 6 weeks. Ford throws 100 pitches in
8 innings and Al Downing strikes out 3 in the 9th as the 3rd-place Yankees
beat Washington, 4-1.

1965
Braves reliever Bill O'Dell sees Red again as he is victimized for the 2nd
day in a row by a 9th-inning Cincy homer. This time it is Tony Perez doing
the damage by hitting a 3-run homer to defeat the Braves, 7-4.

Boston's Earl Wilson fans 13 batters in beating the Senators, 8-3.

Moonlight Graham dies in Chisholm, MN. Graham played in one ML game, for
the 1905 Giants, and did not get to bat. His character in W.P. Kinsella's
Shoeless Joe, later played by Burt Lancaster in the movie Field of Dreams,
made him a baseball household name.

1966
Whitey Ford (2-5) undergoes surgery for a circulatory problem in his left

a 2-1 victory, and the Twins sweep Cleveland to take first place in the
tight American League pennant race. Chance allows a run in the first on two
walks and a wild pitch. The victory gives Chance a 17-9 record and lowers
his ERA to 2.42. On August 5th, the Twins' 26-year-old right-hander hurled
five perfect innings in an abbreviated game against the Red Sox.

The Tigers trip KC, 3-0, as John Hiller records his second straight shutout
in his first two ML starts. Homers by Eddie Mathews, Dick McAuliffe and
Bill Freehan provide the scoring as the fourth-place Tigers stay 1 1/2
games out of first.

1968
The Tigers, ahead 5-0, fail to score with two on in the 4th inning when
the Yanks bring in Rocky Colavito. The 35-year-old slugger retires Kaline
and Horton and tosses 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief to earn the win. In
Rocky's only other appearance, in 1958, he also faced Kaline. The victory by a
non-pitcher will be the last this century. Robinson and Cox crash successive
homers to tie the score and, after a walk, Rocky comes around to score the
winning run. In the 8th, Yankees reliever Lindy McDaniel ties the AL record
for consecutive batters retired by setting down the first Tiger he faces,
giving him 32 straight batters retired over 4 appearances. New York sweeps,

Astro Cliff Johnson hits a 2-out HR in the top of the 11th off the Cards'
Bob Gibson for his 6th in 6 consecutive games, pushing his team to a 4-3
lead. Unfortunately, with 2 outs the game is called due to rain in the
bottom half of the inning, and the score reverts to what it was in the 10th,
thus erasing Johnson's HR. It deprives Johnson of becoming only the 2nd NL
player to hit 6 HRs in 6 consecutive games (he also had one in an exhibition
game). For Bob Gibson, who pitches the 11th, his last career homer served
up reverts to LaCock's grand slam 11 days ago.

24-2 slaughter of the Blue Jays. The 24 runs the 26 hits are both Angel
