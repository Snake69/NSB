1902
The Athletics move into first place to stay as 18,675, the largest crowd
of the year, see them beat Chicago, 2-1. Rube Waddell strikes out 11 in
topping Clark Griffith.

1903
Toledo native George Mullin, pitching for the Tigers, helps the
attendance today (6,000) as the Tigers take on New York in a Sunday game
in Toledo. Mullin is racked for 8 runs, but Detroit scores 12, led by the
hitting of Sam Crawford, who is 5 for 6.

The Boston Americans roll over visiting Cleveland, 14-7, scoring in all
8 innings.

1904
The Pirates disappoint 23,000 at the Polo Grounds by sweeping two from the
Giants, 7-2 and 4-1. The Bucs jump on Mathewson for 5 runs in two innings
of the opener. It's the first doubleheader loss for New York this year.

1907
The Washington Post reports that Browns SS Bobby Wallace is the highest
paid player in either league at a salary of $6,500.

1908
The last-place Cardinals deal a blow to the Giants' pennant hopes by
defeating them twice in St. Louis, 6-5 and 3-2. With Mathewson refusing to
pitch on Sundays, Red Ames and Joe McGinnity take the losses. Matty will
toss a shutout tomorrow for New York.

1909
On a gloomy and extremely overcast day at newly-opened Forbes Field, New
York and Pittsburgh play to a 2-2 tie, stopped after 8 innings because of
a drenching downpour. Off Christy Mathewson, Ham Hyatt hits his 3rd pinch
triple of the year, a record that won't be matched till 1970. Outfielder Red
Murray prevents a loss for Matty with one of the greatest catches ever seen at
Forbes Field. With two outs and two on, Dots Miller belts a long line drive
off Matty into the growing darkness. With everyone straining to follow the
ball, a bolt of lightening flashes and Murray is seen making a bare-handed
grab on the dead run to end the inning. Bill Klem then calls the game.

The A's jump on Walter Johnson, scoring 6 runs in 5 innings, before relief
comes in. The A's win, 6-1, over Johnson, but he'll come back tomorrow to
beat them. Before exiting, Johnson hits his first ML homer, off Harry Krause,
who will lead the AL in ERA with a sparkling 1.39. The homer, just the 3rd hit
over Washington's LF fence, goes through a window of an adjoining building.

The Browns-Indians game is rained out in Cleveland, but St. Louis P
Rube Waddell still sees some action. While walking around he hears a gas
explosion, part of a warehouse fire that injures eight people, and hurries
to the fire. Forcing his way through the barrier ropes, Rube spots some
firemen attempting to secure a rope around a wall. He shouts that they are
using the wrong knot, then climbs up and knots the rope himself. Several
spectators recognize the P and cheer him on.

1910
The Tigers top the Senators, 8-3, with Ty Cobb stealing home for the 2nd
time in his career. It comes in the 4th inning with Bob Groom on the mound.

1911
At Brooklyn, Honus Wagner suffers a serious ankle injury rounding first in the
first inning. He will miss 13 games, play one at first base, then miss another
12. With Wagner out the Pirates will lose 8 of 13 and drop out of the race.

At the Polo Grounds, it takes Christy Mathewson just 92 pitches to top the
Reds, 6-1. Big Six allows just two Cincy hits in beating George Suggs. It is
Matty's 22nd straight win over the Ohioans. The New York American asserts
that this game is a major-league record for fewest pitches, "although the
organized baseball record at the time is said to belong to 'one Mr. Delhi
of the Pacific Coast League' who pitched only 75 balls in a game." (the
latter noted by R.J. Lesch)

In the 4th inning, Wildfire Schulte busts his record 4th grand slam of
the season to help the Cubs maul the Boston Rustlers, 13-6. Pitching,
it's Brown over Brown as Mordecai tops Buster.

Philadelphia OF Sherry Magee is reinstated following his suspension for
attacking umpire Finneran several weeks ago,

1912
Walter Johnson and Joe Wood are in pursuit of Rube Marquard's 19-game win
streak. Johnson picks on the White Sox for his 14th straight, a 2-hitter,
tying Jack Chesbro's 1904 mark. Only 3 balls are hit out of the infield. The
Washingtonians win, 2-0, beating "our meatball expert" (Chicago Record-Herald)
Joe Benz with 8 hits. A week later Joe Wood will win number 13 in a row.

In Chicago, the Giants score twice in the opening frame off Jim Lavender to
knock out the would-be Giant killer and go on to win, 7-4. Merkle and Doyle
pull off a double steal in the inning, with Doyle on the front end. Jeff
Tesreau puzzles the locals and the Cubs drop six games behind the Giants.

Behind Hamilton's seven hitter, the lowly Browns beat the front running
Red Sox, 3-2. Hamilton gives up six hits to beat O'Brien. Boston is 8 1/2
ahead of the A's.

1913
For the second time in 2 weeks, a Brooklyn player his two
inside-the-park homers. This time it is Tom Fisher in a nitecap 14-5 win
at St. Louis. Brooklyn also beats the Cards in the opener, 1-0, behind
Earl Yingling.

1915
At Boston, Smoky Joe Wood fires a 1-0 shutout over Washington. The Senators
have lost all 11 games at Fenway this year.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, Tiger rookie Bernie Boland no-hits
Cleveland through 26 batters before Ben Paschal singles, his first and only
hit of the year. Boland wins, 3-1.

Miles Main of Kansas City (FL) pitches a 5-0 no-hitter versus Buffalo.

1918
The 2nd place Indians trample the Yankees, 12-4, behind the slugging of
Smoky Joe Wood. Smoky is 4 for 5 with 3 RBIs and a steal of home, while
winner Fritz Coumbe adds 3 hits for Cleveland. Del Pratt has a 2-run HR
in the first off Coumbe but Cleveland retaliates with 7 runs against Happy
Finneran. Ray Chapman's verbal assault on Finneran helps drive the pitcher
from the mound in the 4th.

The Tigers score 6 runs in the 9th inning against the Senators to tie the
game at 6 apiece. The Motor Citymen are shutout in the next 6 innings by
reliever Walter Johnson, but score 2 in the 16th to win, 8-7. Reliever
George Cunningham scores the deciding run to beat Johnson.

The Dodgers hand Erskine Mayer his first loss since joining the Pirates,
beating him, 5-1, behind the six-hit pitching of Larry Chaney. Mayer had
won 8 straight since coming to the Buccaneers from the Phils on July 1.

1919
The Browns set an AL record with 53 total chances against the A's, but
lose 7-4. The Browns have 27 assists and St. Louis 1B George Sisler has 18
putouts. With no putouts, the St. Louis outfielders have the day off.

1920
At the Polo Grounds Cleveland SS Ray Chapman, 29, is beaned by a Carl Mays
pitch. A righthanded batter who crowds the plate, Chapman freezes and fails
to get out of the way of the submarine delivery. He is carried from the
field and dies the next day from a fractured skull. The Indian shortstop
will be the only on-field player fatality in major league history. Mays,
a surly, unpopular pitcher, will be the target of fans' and players'
outrage. Chapman, a Cleveland favorite since his debut in 1912, had been
married the previous year. In October his wife will receive a full World
Series share, $3,986.34. The incident has no effect on Mays' pitching. One
week later he will blank Detroit, 10-0, and go on to win 26 and lose 11. Joe
Sewell will be called up to take Chapman's place, and for 14 years he will
be the hardest man in baseball to strike out. The Indians, ahead 3-0 at
the time of the beaning, edge the Yanks, 4-3, to open a half-game lead on
the idle White Sox.

1921
The Braves' Walter Cruise connects off the Cubs' Grover Alexander for the
2nd homerun hit out of mammoth Braves Field. The first homerun, also to RF,
was hit by Cruise in 1917. There will be 38 HRs in Braves Field this year:
34 inside-the-park, 3 bounce homers and Cruise's missile. Braves pitcher
Dana Fillingim is the beneficiary of the offense as he beats Alexander, 8-6.

1922
The Browns beat Walter Johnson and the Senators again, 11-2. Brownie star
George Sisler is 1 for 5 with a run scored.

In Pittsburgh, trailing 7-6 the Pirates load the bases with two outs before
Walter Schmidt drives a ball to deep left center. Giants LF Casey Stengel
makes a dramatic catch on the dead run to preserve the New York win.

1926
In Boston, the Red Sox split a pair with the Browns, losing 6-1 and winning
7-1. In the 2nd game, two Red Sox players - Alex Gaston in the 2nd and Fred
Haney in 6th - triple with bases loaded. This is the first time its been
done in the AL, and ties the ML record.

1927
In an 8-1 Yankee victory, Babe Ruth puts his stamp of approval on the newly
constructed Comiskey Park grandstand roof by cranking a Tommy Thomas pitch
over the addition in left field, where it lands in a parking lot. He is
the first player to hit one over the roof. It is Ruth's 37th of the year
and he now trails Lou Gehrig by a homer.

Charlie Root pitches the Cubs to a 3-0 win over Brooklyn, increasing
Chicago's lead over the Pirates to 6 games. Doug McWeeny is the loser as
Root wins his 22nd.

1928
Braves outfielder Lance Richbourg does all his damage in the first 3 innings
of a 9-4 win over the Cardinals. He homers in the 1st, doubles in the 2nd
with the bases loaded and triples in the 3rd with 2 men on.

At Philadelphia, the A's overwhelm the Tigers, 18-6. Philadelphia scores
9 runs in the second inning as Jimmy Foxx contributes 2 doubles. He adds
a homer and scores 4 runs in the game. Simmons, Hargrave and MacManus also
hit for the circuit.

1930
Lefty Grove (20-4) wins his 20th game of the season, and 6th in a row,
beating the Browns in Philadelphia, 4-2. Grove drives in the first two runs
in the 2nd off Dick Coffman, who gives up 9 hits in the loss. The Browns
net 10 hits off Grove.

At Wrigley, the league-leading Cubs nip the Phillies, 10-9, then play to a
3-3 tie in 11 innings before darkness intervenes. The Phils score 8 runs in
the 7th to take a 9-8 lead, but Gabby Hartnett's drive wins the game for
Chicago. Hack Wilson hits his 41st homer in the opener. The Phils manage
just two hits in the nitecap, but take a 3-0 lead into the 9th. But Chicago
scores a run on a balk by Stephenson, then Woody English cracks a two-run
homer to tie.

Meanwhile, the 2nd place Dodgers split with the Pirates, winning 7-5 before
losing 6-2.

1932
At Wrigley Field, 32,000 are on hand to celebrate "Charlie Grimm Day,"
in honor of the Cubs' new manager. The Cubs put the icing on the cake by
rallying for 4 runs in the 9th inning to beat the Braves, 4-3, and retain
their one-game lead over the Pirates. Billy Jurges' 2-run single is the
winner.

The Pirates top the Dodgers, 4-0, as Larry French scatters 7 singles. The
2nd-place Bucs (61-52) lead the Dodgers (62-56) by two and a half
games. French breaks a scoreless tie with an 8th-inning double and then scores
on Lloyd Waner's single. A sacrifice and walk to brother Paul follows. A
passed ball and throw to second by Al Lopez ends with the catcher throwing
his mask down and being tossed. A triple by Barbee and a single by Pie
Traynor completes the scoring off Bill Clark.

After Lefty Grove is given his trophy for winning the 1931 MVP, the Athletics
lose a 3-2 decision to the Indians and drop to 3rd place. Myatt's two-run
homer in the 5th inning, off Earnshaw, is the big blow, and Mule Haas'
two-run homer in the 8th is all the scoring of the A's. Earnshaw loses his
10th with Mel Harder the winner. Cleveland (68-46) is now in 2nd place to
the Yankees (78-35).

1933
A stiff wind helps the scoring in Winnipeg, as the Maroons (Northern League)
upend the visiting Eau Claire Cardinals, 35-19, in 2 hours 37 minutes. Bruno
Haas' team leads 11-2 but the Cards tie it 14-14 after 4 innings. Elmer
Greenwald paces the Maroons going 5 for 6 with 5 runs and 6 RBIs. A tired
Winnipeg loses the nitecap, 7-4.

1934
Dizzy Dean takes his appeal to Judge Landis in Chicago, who schedules a
hearing in St. Louis. Paul Dean accepts the fine and is reinstated.

1939
The Giants suspend 2B Burgess Whitehead, who bizarrely will show up the next
day in full uniform at Yankee Stadium and ask to work out. Yankee manager
Joe McCarthy refuses. Whitehead rejoins the Giants a few days later, but
he will be suspended again in mid-September after leaving the team.

At Forbes Field, Cardinal OF Terry Moore belts two homers, both
inside-the-park, in the Cards' sweep of the Pirates, 4-3 and 3-0. In the
next 50 years, the only National Leaguer to hit two inside-the-park HRs in
a game will be Hank Thompson, in 1950.

1940
Jimmie Foxx smashes 2 homers to help the Red Sox beat the Senators, 7-6. The
two round trippers move him ahead of Gehrig on the all time list with a
total of 495.

1944
Cardinal reliever Fred Schmidt starts against the Giants and shuts them out,
5-0, to give the first-place Cards their 80th victory. It is the earliest
date in history that a team has recorded 80 wins.

1947
Ralph Kiner hits 3 successive HRs for the host Pittsburgh Pirates, in a 12-7
win over the Cardinals in a game in which the 2 clubs bang out a ML-record
(since topped) 10 homers. Two other Bucs, Hank Greenberg and Billy Cox,
and one Cardinal (Whitey Kurowski) each contribute 2 HRs to set a ML
record for most players with 2+ homers in a game. Kiner matches the ML
mark of seven HRs in 4 games, six in 3 games, five in 2 games, and 4 in
consecutive at-bats. By the end of the month, Big Ralph will still trail
Mize 39 to 43 in a head-to-head HR competition that will only be matched by
Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961. Starters Roger Wolff and the Cards'
Ken Burkhart exit in the first inning.

1948
At the age 53, with his wife Claire and his two adopted daughters at his
side, Babe Ruth dies of throat cancer at Memorial Hospital in New York
City. His body will be put on display at Yankee Stadium and be viewed by
more than 100,000 fans.

1950
Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers denies news reports that Jackie
Robinson, last year's MVP, will be traded. The latest tempest was started
by the second baseman's comments after he was removed from the lineup on
August 12th by Bert Shotton after making an error. "I wouldn't be surprised
if I was traded," Jackie was quoted as saying.

At the Polo Grounds, Henry Thompson of the Giants hits two HRs, both
inside-the-park, as the Giants pummel the Dodgers, 16-7. Thompson is the
first to do this since Terry Moore hit two for the Cardinals at Forbes Field
on this same date in 1939. Don Mueller adds a grand slam. The Giants jump
on Erskine in the first inning as 13 of the first 14 batters reach first
safely. Sal Maglie is the winner despite giving up two homers, good for
six runs, to Gil Hodges. The win leaves the Dodgers in 3rd place, 7 games
out and the Giants in 5th, 10 games in back of the Phils.

The Phils polish off the 2nd place Braves, 5-1, on Robin Roberts'
three-hitter. The Phils score 4 in the 4th off Vern Bickford, concluding
the scoring with Del Ennis' 26th homer.

1951
Sal Maglie outpitches Don Newcombe, 2-1, to cut the Dodger lead over the
Giants to 9 1/2 games. Maglie allows 4 hits, including Billy Cox' 300-foot
homer, in winning his 17th. The Giants score the winner in the 7th when Bobby
Thomson scores on a wild pitch. Reese goes hitless, ending his 22-game streak.

The Browns end the Indians win streak at 13 when Tommy Byrne pitches and
bats St. Louis to a 4-0 win. Byrne allows two hits in 7 innings and drives
in all the runs before retiring with back spasms. Mike Garcia loses to drop
the Indians' lead to 1 1/2 games over the Yankees.

The Cards score 6 runs in the 7th inning to defeat the Pirates, 9-6. Murry
Dickson, trying for his 17th win, takes the loss. Stan Musial hits a 3-run
homer in the 6th to start the scoring for St. Louis. His inside-the-park homer
is his first hit in 13 at-bats, and his 2nd inside-the-park homer in 4 days.

At Elmira, New York, minor-leaguer Don Zimmer marries Jean Carol Bauerle
at home plate. Teammate Ed Roebuck is supposed to make it a double wedding,
but opts for a church instead.

1952
The Phils heave a sigh of relief as their game with Brooklyn is called on
account of rain with one out in the top of the 7th. But the host Dodgers
win 15-0 using an all-right-handed lineup. Billy Loes is the easy winner,
and Dick Williams leads the way with 3 hits.

1953
Paced by Snider's 3 homers, the Dodgers extend their win streak to 9 with
3-1 and 9-5 wins over the Pirates. Vic Janowicz hits his 1st ML HR to
account for the only run off Roe in the opener.

At Cincy, Ted Kluszewski hits his 35th and 36th homers, breaking the club
mark set by Hank Sauer in 1948. The Reds split with the Cards, winning 3-2
and losing 6-2.

In the Negro League All-Star game at Comiskey Park, the West beats the East,
5-1, behind the pitching of Sammy (Buddy) Woods. Willie Gaines takes the loss.

features a Mark Kauffman's photo of Braves slugger Eddie Mathews at-bat in
Milwaukee's County Stadium.

In a throwing contest between Jimmy Piersall and Willie Mays before a Red
Sox-Giants charity game in Boston, Piersall hurts his arm. He starts the
game but leaves midway. He wakes up the following morning with a sore arm
that stays with him a year, and he will never throw quite as well again.

1955
At Fenway, Mantle clouts his 4th homer in 3 days, this one clearing the 379
foot wall in left-center field and hitting a building across the street. The
Yanks roll over Frank Sullivan to win, 13-6.

1956
At Brooklyn, Duke Snider belts a HR in the 13th off Dick Littlefield to give
the Dodgers a 10-9 win over the Giants. It is Duke's 33rd homer of the year,
but his 1st off a lefty.

At Chicago, Sam Jones strikes out 13 Reds to win, 4-2, and ties the club
20th-century mark for strikeouts in a 9-inning game. Lon Warneke struck
out 13 in 1934. The loss goes to Brooks Lawrence. Frank Robinson homers
but also K's 4 times.

Stan Musial belts his 1,072nd extra base hit to break Ott's NL mark. But the
Cardinals can do little against the Braves' Lew Burdette, losing 8-0. Vinegar
Bend Mizell takes the loss.

1957
At Jersey City, Johnny Podres beats the Pirates, 4-1, for the Dodgers.

In front of 45,537 at County Stadium, the Cards defeat the Braves, 8-2,

games. St. Louis was in 1st place on August 4.

1958
Pirates slugger Frank Thomas clouts 3 consecutive HRs in a 13-4 pasting of
the Reds. Pittsburgh is now 7 games behind Milwaukee.

1961
Cincinnati takes the NL lead for good with a shutout sweep, 6-0 and 8-0,
at Los Angeles before 72,140, a record crowd for a NL doubleheader. Bob
Purkey gives up 4 hits and Jim O'Toole just 2 in handing the Dodgers their
1st twinbill whitewash since July 18, 1935.

Roger Maris ties an AL record with his 7th HR in his 6th straight game,
as New York beats Chicago, 5-4, in the 9th inning. His two blasts off Billy
Pierce give him 48, three more than Mickey Mantle.

1962
Rick Wise tosses a shutout, the Phillies' 4th in a row, to beat Houston,
7-0. The streak ends tomorrow in the 1st inning when Houston's Sandy
Valdespino steals home.

For the 2nd night in a row, Frank Robinson clouts 2 homers to power the
Reds to a 7-1 win over the Braves. Robby now has 9 homers in 8 games and
11 in the last 12. Lee Maye's HR off Maloney is the only Braves' score.

1964
Sandy Koufax (19-5) pitches a 3-0 win against St. Louis, but he will miss
the rest of the season because of an elbow injury suffered when he slid
back into 2B against Milwaukee on August 8. In the nightcap, Curt Simmons
matches Koufax with a 4-0 shutout of the Dodgers. Card CF Curt Flood has
8 straight hits in the doubleheader split.

1965
At Fenway, Earl Wilson is most of the Boston offense as he bangs a pair of
homeruns. But the righty still takes the loss to the White Sox, 5-4.

Chris Short beats the Dodgers for the 5th time this season as the Phils win,
6-1. Only Jim Lefebrvre's 9th-inning homer stops Short from a shutout. Maury
Wills has 2 stolen bases as the Dodgers' lead over the Braves shrinks to
a half-game.

1966
In a 3-1 Giants win over the Cardinals, Willie Mays hits his 534th career
homerun. The "Say Hey Kid's" third-inning round-tripper ties him with
Jimmie Foxx for the most career homeruns hit by a right-handed batter in
major league history. Gaylord Perry gets today's win.

1967
Reds P Jim Maloney retires all 19 batters he faces, but has to leave
the game with one out in the 7th when he steps in a hole and injures
his ankle. Reliever Billy McCool allows 2 hits and the Reds win, 2-0,
in Pittsburgh.

1968
Detroit's Denny McLain is 16-0 on the road after blanking the Red Sox,
4-0, in Boston. Tigers C Bill Freehan is hit by a pitch in 3 consecutive
at-bats, painfully tying a ML record. He will be hit a record-tying 24
times this season.

Philadelphia's Richie Allen ties a NL record by drawing 5 bases on balls
in one game, but the Dodgers win, 7-5.

1969

(enroute to 269) for the 7th season, a NL record.

Seattle's Sicks Stadium shakes when 250-pound Boog Powell legs out an
inside-the-park homer in the 9th against ex-teammate Steve Barber. It really
isn't that vital, as Baltimore romps 15-3.

The Phillies rack up their 4th straight shutout victory when Rick Wise
pitches a 4-hitter to defeat the Astros, 7-0. The Phils set a modern club
record with the streak. Dick Allen has a homer and Rick Wise joins in with
a homer and a single.

1970
Down 3-0 in the 8th, the Brewers score 4 runs, three of the runs on a Danny
Walton bases loaded double, to beat the Indians, 4-3. Gus Gil's single
drives in the last run. The biggest crowd of the season, 44,387, is on
hand for bat day, allowing Bernie Brewer (Milt Mason) to leave his perch
in right field after 40 days. Bernie had vowed in late June to stay there
until the crowd topped 40,000, and when the attendance was announced, Bernie
slid down his slide. Before Mason's death in 1973, he is recognized as the
original Bernie Brewer, and a costumed character with the same name becomes
the team's official mascot in 1973, as a tribute to the retired engineer.

In a 5-3 Montreal win over the Astros, Bob Bailey hits one of the longest
HRs in Astrodome history.

1971
Harmon Killebrew, who has a higher percentage of his hits (28.6%) go for
homeruns than any other player, collects his annual triple in an 11-2
win over the Indians. It marks his 8th season when he will hit exactly
one three-bagger.

1975
After a frustrating 9-1 loss in Minnesota, Indians manager Frank Robinson
chews out his 52-65 team. The fiery skipper appears to have gotten the
players' attention when the Tribe wins 27 of the remaining 42 contests,
finishing the season just one game under .500.

In a 9-1 win over Cleveland, the Twins set a ML mark with 9 batters getting
2+ hits. Jim Hughes is the recipient of the largesse.

1976
With the help of three picked-off Oakland runners at 1B, the first such
occurrence in the AL since 1910, the Brewers beat Oakland, 4-3. Another
oddity happens when Oakland's Billy Williams is called out on strikes after
refusing to enter the batter's box. He is then thrown out of the game.

Lou Brock collects 5 hits in a losing cause as the Cardinals fall to the
Padres, 11-7.

1977
At Yankee Stadium, New York blows a 9-4 lead in the top of the 9th when
Chicago scores six runs, but a two-run homer by Chris Chambliss in the
bottom of the inning gives the Yankees an 11-10 win.

At Montreal, the Phillies win their 13th straight a 20th century club record,
beating the Expos, 7-5. Warren Brusstar is the winner over Kerrigan.

1978
Boston's Luis Tiant wins his 200th ML game, beating Nolan Ryan and the
Angels, 4-2. Jim Rice's 2-run HR is the difference.

1982
Richie Hebner returns to the Pirates, who buy the vet from the Tigers.

1986
Dale Holman, of the Richmond Braves (International L) becomes the first
professional player to ever play for two teams in one game. The game
was suspended because of rain on June 16 when he was in the lineup for
Syracuse. By the time the game is completed today, Holman had been traded
to Richmond and is in the lineup (as noted by Doug Lyons).

1987
Tim Raines goes 5 for 5 and hits for the cycle to lead the Expos to a 10-7
win over Pittsburgh.

The wind is blowing out at Wrigley as the Mets pound the Cubs, 23-10,
at Wrigley Field, setting a club record for runs scored in a game. They
score 3 runs in each of 5 innings and 7 in another. Darryl Strawberry leads
the way with a pair of doubles and a homer, off Greg Maddux, and scores 5
runs. Ron Darling lasts 6 innings to earn the win.

1988
The Dodgers trade Pedro Guerrero to the Cardinals for pitcher John Tudor,
whose 2.29 ERA is leading the NL.

1989

a 15-year-old girl. He will be sentenced to 60 days in jail after the season.

Lefty Tom Drees, 26, pitches his 3rd no-hitter of the season for Vancouver
(AAA), beating Las Vegas, 5-0, in the 7-inning opener of a doubleheader. He
fired consecutive 1-0 no-hitters, beating Calgary in 9 innings (May 23rd)
and Edmonton in 7 (May 28th). Drees, now 12-11, will pitch 7+ innings for
the White Sox in 1991.

1990
In a 7-5 loss to the Indians, the Twins' Kirby Puckett starts off in RF and
then moves to SS, 3B and 2B in the 8th inning. Newman switches from 3B to

1991
The Red Sox obtain P Dan Petry from the Braves in exchange for a player to
be named later.

1992

route, winning his 15th, beating Brian Williams.

1996
San Diego OF Steve Finley homers in the Padres game against the Mets in
Monterrey, Mexico. By doing so, he becomes the 1st major league player to
have homered in 3 different countries, having previously hit four-baggers in
the US and Canada. The Padres win the 1st regular season game to be played
outside of the US or Canada, 15-10, belting 4 homers. Leadoff batter Tony
Gwynn is 3 for 5 and will repeat it tomorrow in the 7-3 loss to the Mets.

League, who were banned from their own state's post-season tournament 47

during the streak and has kept it alive six times by getting a hit in his
final at-bat.
