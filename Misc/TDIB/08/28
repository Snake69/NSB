1907
Highlander pitcher John "Tacks" Neuer, begins baseball's most successful
short career by besting the Red Sox, 1-0, in his first start, the nitecap
of a DH. In one month he will pitch 6 complete games, win 4, including 3
shutouts, and then disappear from the ML scene. In the first game, Boston's
other Cy - Cy Morgan - wins over the Highlanders, 5-3.

1908

1909
In the first of two games at South Side Park, William "Dolly" Gray of
Washington enters the record books by walking 8 White Sox in the 2nd inning,
with 7 of the walks in a row (both ML records). The 6 runs scored are
enough for a 6-4 Chicago win, although they manage only one hit against
Dolly. Leading off the 2nd, Patsy Dougherty logs the only hit, and when
he bats again in the inning, manager Billy Sullivan suggests he go to the
plate without a bat. For Dougherty, this is the 3rd of 4 times he'll have
the only hit in a game. Washington cops the second game, 2-1.

In New York, the matchup between Three Finger Brown and Christy Mathewson
fizzles when the Cubs score 4 runs in the first two innings. Matty is lifted
and Brown wins the game, 6-1.

The first six New York batters reach base safely, and though two cross
the plate, only one counts as the Yankees lose, 2-1, to Detroit. Engel
hits a leadoff single and stays on 1B when Chase chops a ball in the air
and Engel thinks it is a pop up. Engle is tagged out. Four more singles
plate one run and Knight is called back to 3B when a hit ball touches an
umpire. Cobb has a single, double and triple for the Bengals.

The Milwaukee White Sox and the Leland Giants square off at Auburn Park
with the Sox winning, 1-0, in 11 innings. Pederson hits a 2-out single that
scores Matt, who was on with a double. Till then, Dougherty had given up
2 hits. Ernie Groth is the winner.

- in a doubleheader with Chicago, but they make them count. Boston wins,
5-3 and 3-0.

1913
Walter Johnson's 14-game winning streak is ended, although it takes Boston
11 innings to beat him, 1-0. Boston manages a 2nd-inning single by Steve
Yerkes and doesn't have another baserunner until Yerkes singles again in the
11th, and reaches 3rd as the ball goes through the legs of CF Clyde Milan. A
fielder's choice, and single wins it. Johnson strikes out 10, five in a row,
and walks none. The winner is Ray Collins, who beat Johnson, 1-0, on June 6,
and lost to him by that score on July 3.

1915
Pitching for St. Louis in the Federal League, 39-year-old Eddie Plank records
his 300th career win, beating Kansis City, 3-2. Henning is the loser. Plank

post a 16-15 for the 1916 St. Louis Browns.

In the first of two at Cleveland, the Red Sox win, 5-3, behind Babe Ruth
and Carl Mays.

Giants pitcher Rube Benton bends but doesn't break, as he allows 12 Cincinnati
hits, but shuts out the Reds, 4-0.

who will also pitch his last game in just two days, posts an ERA of 10.12
appearing in only two games for Chicago.

Despite 3 doubles by Ruth, the Tigers drop the Yankees, 7-3. Ruth starts
a record streak in which he gets at least one extra-base hit in 9 straight
games. Into the record books go his 119 extra-base hits, 177 runs, and 457
total bases. His .846 slugging average is one point behind that of a year ago.

Cardinals, winning 5-2 and 8-3. Cards teenager Ed Clough makes his ML debut
in relief in game 2. The 18-year-old was on the team last year but didn't
appear in a game. He'll go 0-1 next year.

1925
Although the Baker Bowl is considered a bandbox by some, the aggressive Kiki
Cuyler of the Pirates hits 2 inside-the-park HRs there in a 10-9 victory
over the Phils. Kiki hits one in the first and another in the 8th. Cuyler
will hit 8 inside the park this year, tied for 3rd behind only Cobb (9 -
1909) and Crawford (12 - 1901).

1926
The Indians use the same lineup in 2 victories over the Red Sox, including
Emil Levsen, who pitches the 6-1 and 5-1 sweep. He strikes out none and
allows 4 hits in the opener and then, responding to good natured kidding
from teammates Joe Sewell and Jack Burns about how easy he had it, asks
manager Speaker if he can pitch the nitecap. "Spoke" agrees and Levsen again
allows 4 hits and no walks, becoming the last pitcher to throw 2 complete
games in a day.

13-1. Eddie Morgan scores 5 runs for the Tribe.

1932
The Red Sox "eclipse" the Indians in the 2nd game of a doubleheader,
4-3 in 11 innings, as light-hitting Bennie Tate poles a 1-out HR to end
it. The game was previously scheduled for August 31, but a solar eclipse
was due that would blacken the ballpark for 20 minutes, so the game is
played today instead. The Indians take the opener, 10-1, scoring 7 runs
in the 1st inning to drive Bob Weiland to the showers. Three days later,
Fenway goes dark for twenty minutes during the solar event.

Kiki Cuyler again leads the way for the Cubs, collecting 3 hits and driving

over the Giants for their 10th win in a row.

base coach Bill Terry inserted himself as a pinch hitter and delivers a
bases-loaded single past Floyd Young to break the 1-1 tie in the 14th. Fred
Fitzsimmons goes 13 innings for the Giants before being lifted for a pinch
hitter in the 14th. Waite Hoyt, the Brooklyn mortician, is his equal,
scattering 12 hits in 13 innings before exiting for Birkover. The Giants'
streak will be stopped tomorrow by Red Lucas.

The Cubs win their 6th in a row, beating the Bees, 18-3, and taking undisputed
hold on 2nd place. Frank Demaree, with a homer, triple and three singles
paces a 21-hit assault. Tex Carleton wins his 12th (and 7th against Boston)
and caps the first inning with a three-run homer. The Cubs score in every
inning but the 7th while the Bees' scoring comes on homers by Al Lopez and
Baxter Jordan.

The Cards drop their 6th straight when the Phils' Bucky Walters stops
them, 8-0, on six hits. Rookie Cotton Pippen, making his first start
for St. Louis, is effective till the 6th when the Phils comb him for two

up three more in the 9th. Phils catcher Earl Grace sandwiches a double in
between four intentional walks.

in the inning. Detroit scores 3 in the frame to tie the AL mark of 14 for the
2nd inning. New York wins, 19-4, in a game mercifully called in the latter
half of the 7th. They also win the opener, 14-5, behind Red Ruffing, as Lou
Gehrig hits his 41st and 42nd of the year. Rolfe adds 4 RBIs on three hits,
and the Yankees score 35 runs in 14 innings for the afternoon. No pitcher
will match Murph's 5 hits until 1964, when Mel Stottlemyre cards five.

1937
Van Mungo is suspended indefinitely for insubordination after rejecting
the Dodger trainer's program to cure his sore arm. Trade rumors swirl,

hotel and disappears.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader with the Boston Bees, Cubs reliever Clay
Bryant breaks a 6-6 tie with a 10th-inning grand slam, off Gabler. The
Cubs win, 10-7. Bryant took over for starter Charlie Root, who earlier hit
a homer. It is the second time this century that two pitchers on the same

with Jackie Robinson to share his plans to integrate the major leagues. During

will come with being the first player to cross the color line this century.

Against the Phillies, Brooklyn's teenage SS Tommy Brown hits a triple and

to Rizzuto load the bases. Mapes walks to force in a run and a grounder
brings home the winner.

day in a row the Tribe has blown a big lead, losing a 7 run lead yesterday.

At Wrigley Field, Hank Sauer socks three consecutive homeruns, off Curt
Simmons, as the Cubs edge the Phillies, 7-5, in game 1. Sauer will connect

will drive in 24 runs.

In a battle of New York's chief rivals for the AL pennant, Baltimore's
Milt Pappas has Chicago down, 3-0, in the 8th. An apparent 3-run HR by Ted
Kluszewski is nullified because umpire Ed Hurley calls time just before Pappas
delivers. Hurley spotted Floyd Robinson and Earl Torgeson warming up along
the RF sideline. The Sox argue for 15 minutes, with Nellie Fox and Al Lopez

duplicate three seasons later.

In the ninth inning of a Reds' 3-2 loss to Philadelphia at Crosley Field,
Chico Ruiz becomes the only major leaguer ever to pinch-hit for Johnny

to left field standing in for the future Hall of Famer, who goes 0 for 3
in his first big league game.

1970
During the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader against

game will prove to be his last in the major leagues as a deep slump
and constant harassment from the Cleveland fans takes a personal toll

depression. Cleveland and California split a pair, with the Angels taking
the opener, 3-2, and the Tribe the nitecap, 5-1.

drives home the winner with a 2-run double. Jim Rice hits his 34th homer,

the league in that category.

team in 91 years, and this time there were no fans on the field to add to
help the hit total. The 26 singles sets a new AL mark. Kevin Seitzer and
Scott Fletcher each get 5 hits, combine for 8 RBIs and 7 runs. The Brewers

the brightest decisions of my career when I passed on a young pitcher out of
Ferrum College [Billy Wagner] and chose another who never got out of A ball."

In Williamsport, Long Beach becomes the first U.S. team to repeat as Little
League champions, beating Panama, 3-2. Long Beach, led by Jeff Burrough's

1984-85 and Monterrey, Mexico, in 1957-58 are the other repeaters.

in exchange for minor leaguers Ron Wright and Corey Pointer, and a player
to be named (Jason Schmidt). The Bucs will save some more bucks in 2 days,
dealing vet Charlie Hayes.

Seattle's 10-2 win over the visiting Yankees is delayed 10 minutes by
a bench-clearing brawl in the 8th inning following a close pitch by M's
rookie Tim Davis. The M's John Marzano and Yanks Paul O'Neill and Jeff
Nelson all receive 2-game suspensions, with the New Yorkers each getting
fined $1,000. Nelson opened the 8th by plunking Joey Cora.

for Seattle.

Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez hit successive HRs in the
4th inning of the Rangers' 6-5 win over the White Sox in the 1st game of

14 HRs in the doubleheader to tie an AL record.

Tied with the Indians at 6-6 going into the 10th inning, the Athletics score

Cleveland stretching back to 1991.

2000
The players' association has exercised its option to extend the collective
bargaining agreement ensuring labor peace through October 31, 2001. The
expected move comes as no surprise as the players appear to be happy with
the November 1996 deal, but the owners have expressed concerns the present
CBA has widened the talent gap between the high and low-revenue markets
due to escalating salaries.

The Athletics defeat the White Sox, 3-0, as Tim Hudson hurls a 1-hitter. Frank
Thomas' 4th inning single is the only hit.

accomplished the feat from 1957-60 for the Cubs.

Thanks to Cubs miscues, the Marlins defeat the Cubs, 4-3, in 14 innings,
despite Sammy Sosa's 52nd HR. The blast gives Sosa a share of the NL record
for HRs in August (17), tying the mark set by Willie Mays in 1965. He also
ties Babe Ruth for the most homers in 7 consecutive seasons ... the Babe hit
343 between 1926-32. Mark McGwire has hit 338 homers from 1995 through this
year. Cliff Floyd, playing RF, pulls off an unassisted double play in the

Seattle OF Ichiro Suzuki reaches 200 hits for the season as the Mariners
fall to the Devil Rays, 6-0. By going 2 for 3, Suzuki becomes only the 3rd

in 1987 and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra ten years later.

2002
Odalis Perez of the Los Angeles Dodgers hits a solo homer, off Arizona's

The Cardinals obtain P Jamey Wright from the Brewers in exchange for minor
league OF Chris Morris and cash.

2003

inning and a two-run dinger lefty off Trey Hodges in the ninth, as New York
beats the Braves, 3-1.

Eric Gagne earns his 44th straight save in the Dodgers' 6-3 victory over the

Marlins backup C Ramon Castro is arrested and charged with rape in Pittsburgh
following Florida's game with the Pirates.

Pay up! The Brewers top the host Cincinnati Reds, 4-3, for their 10th
straight win. Brewers manager Ned Yost fulfills on a vow he made to his
team that, if they won 10 straight, he and his coaches would dress up as
Hooters waitresses. They wear the outfits, including the chain's trademark
orange hot pants, on the team's charter to Chicago and on the bus to their
hotel. The Cubs will beat them tomorrow, 4-2, but the Brewers will take
the next 2 from Chicago.

2004
The Dodgers defeat the Mets, 4-2, as Adrian Beltre goes 5 for 5, including

The Padres defeat the Giants, 9-1, to clinch the 4th division title in
franchise history.

Wookie of the year candidate, Chewbacca, throws out the first pitch at
Fenway. Chewie is there to promote a Star Wars exhibition at a local
museum. But the main exhibition is by Ted Lilly, who beats the Red Sox,
7-2, to leave Boston tied with Cleveland for the wild card and a game back
of New York for the AL East. The Jays hit three homers off Bronson Arroyo,
including one by Frank Catalanotto, who adds a double and a triple.

Scott McClung pitches 8 innings as Tampa Bay downs to the Indians, 1-0.

2006
Behind Esteban Loaiza's 7 shutout innings the A's roll over the visiting

ahead of Stan Musial and Willie Stargell.

2007
In a 39-page decision, U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl upholds a New
York City law passed in April which bans the use of metal bats in high

the USA Baseball organization, and various coaches, as well as some of the
parents of the scholastic ballplayers.

cheers as the he is shown on the scoreboard video screen scampering up and
down on the pole.

2008
The Cubs game against the Phillies at Wrigley Field becomes the first contest
to be played with the use of video replay available to umpires to make calls

be employed in any of the three ballparks going online today, will be used
used by all major league clubs starting tomorrow.

In the 11-2 victory over the Dodgers, Cristian Guzman becomes the second
player in Nationals history to hit for the cycle joining Brad Wilkerson
who accomplish the feat 2005, the team's first year in Washington, D.C. The
30-year-old shortstop completes his cycle with an eighth-inning triple.

The Red Sox last regular season game at Yankee Stadium is a fitting finale
for the two rivals at the 85-year-old historic ballpark. Trailing 2-0, the
Bronx Bombers rally late in the game, thanks to Jason Giambi's seventh-inning
pinch-hit two-run homer and his walk-off single in the ninth, to beat Boston,
3-2, avoiding a sweep and keeping their wild card hopes alive.

2009
John Hester, appearing as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning, homers in

went deep in his first big league plate appearance in May.

2012
Starlin Castro agrees to a seven-year contract extension with the Cubs,
which includes a club option for an eighth season in 2020. The 22-year-old

League history to lead the circuit in hits when he collected 207 last season.

2014
Yusmeiro Petit, best known for losing his bid for a perfect game against
Arizona with two outs and two strikes last September, sets a major league
record when he retires his 46th consecutive batter, fanning Charlie Culberson
in the third inning of San Francisco's 4-1 victory over Colorado at AT&T

an out while pitching for the White Sox.

2015
"Vin will be back for one more year (at least). God bless us, everyone" -
