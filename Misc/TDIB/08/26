1901
New York's Christy Mathewson allows just 3 hits in beating the Phils, 3-1.

1902
At Cincinnati, Mathewson tosses his 7th shutout of the year, beating the
Reds, 6-0. Henry Thielman loses his 3rd encounter of the year with Matty.

1903
The Boston Beaneaters drive Mathewson from the mound with 5 runs in the 6th
to take a 6-5 lead over the Giants and hold on to win by that score. When
Roger Bresnahan is called out at home in the 9th, New York's John McGraw
and Gilbert lead the argument against August Moran. Moran tosses them for
their troubles. New York wins the nitecap, 3-2, in 10 innings.

1905
The Giants beat up on the Reds again, winning 2-0 and 6-5. McGinnity wins the
opener, allowing 5 hits in the shutout. New York scores 4 runs in the nitecap
on wild pitches by Orval Overall, but when the Reds load the bases with no
outs in the 9th, Mathewson relieves Dummy Taylor and gets 3 straight outs.

1908
The Giants sweep, scoring a run in the 8th and 2 in the 9th to trip Irv
Young and the host Pirates, 4-3. Mathewson, in relief, is given the win,
though by today's scoring he would receive a save. New York's 8-game win
streak puts them ahead of Pittsburgh and Chicago by 3 1/2 games.

1910
In Pittsburgh's 4-2 win over host Brooklyn, a NL record is set when the
Buc outfield makes just one putout and the Brooklyn OF none.

1911
Pittsburgh, playing without Wagner, is no match for Christy Mathewson,
as the Giants win, 6-2. Tommy Leach, filling in for Wagner at SS, makes
three errors behind Howie Camnitz. The Giants announce that for the first
11 playing days at the new Polo Grounds, the average attendance was 23,864.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1912
Walter Johnson's 16-game winning streak ends under AL rules of the time. In
the 2nd game of a doubleheader against the Browns, he relieves Tom Hughes
with one out and 2 on in the 7th inning of a 2-2 game. The 2 runners score
on a Pete Compton single up the middle and the Senators lose, 4-3. The two
runs are charged to Johnson, not Hughes, giving him the defeat. Under the
NL's rules, Johnson would not be charged with the loss. After the season,
AL president Ban Johnson will change the rules to conform with the senior
circuit, but he will deny he does it because of this game.

At Boston, Owen Wilson has his 2nd three-triple doubleheader this year. The
fleet Buc triples off Otto Hess in the game 1 win, 5-4. In the nitecap, an
8-4 loss, he triples in the 6th and 8th innings off Ed Donnelly. With the
three triples Wilson establishes a new major league record for three baggers
with 32 breaking the mark he shared with Dave Orr (1886 Metropolitans/AA)
and Heinie Reitz (1894 Orioles/NL).

1913
Cincinnati's Chief Johnson surrenders just 3 hits to New York, but loses
a 1-0 decision to Christy Mathewson. Fred Merkle triples in the 7th and
scores the only run.

1914
The Giants lose, 1-0, to the Cardinals, managing just 3 hits off Bill Doak,
but win game 2 on a 2-hitter by Christy Mathewson over Slim Sallee. The
4-0 win is Matty's 20th.

1916
After being knocked out of the box in 3 innings yesterday against
Cleveland, the A's Joe Bush gets revenge by no-hitting Cleveland, 5-0,
in Philadelphia. It is Nap Lajoie's last ML game. He goes 1 for 3 with
a triple, and hits just .280 for the year; his last at-bat is a fly to
RF. Stan Coveleski takes the loss. 'Bullet Joe' will win 15 of the last-place
Athletics' 36 victories this season.

Pete Schneider of the Reds beats the visiting Phillies, 1-0,

1918
Ban Johnson casts the deciding vote in a National Commission decision awarding
the disputed services of P Jack Quinn to the Yankees for 1919 over the claim
of the White Sox, for whom Quinn was 5-1 this year. Quinn became available
when the PCL ended its season early.

1919
Giants 1B Hal Chase handles 35 chances against the Pirates in a doubleheader
split in New York. The Bucs win the nitecap, 4-2, after losing to Art
Nehf, 5-1.

1920
In Philadelphia, the A's top the Indians, 3-2, behind Three-Finger Keefe,
sending the Tribe to its 7th loss in 9 games. Ban Johnson, in Philadelphia
for a league meeting, meets with the Indians, who announce that Tris Speaker
has nothing to do with the boycott petition. Johnson deflates the boycott
movement by sending word out that any team will be fined $1,000 and face
forfeit for not playing against Mays.

The White Sox open their series in New York with a 16-4 pounding of the
Yankees. New York scores 3 runs in the first off Dickie Kerr, led by Ruth's
44th homer, but do little after that.

1922
The Yankees take over first place by beating the Browns, 9-2, behind Carl
Mays. Rasty Wright is the loser.

Pittsburgh's Max Carey steals 2B, 3B and home as Pittsburgh wins, 9-2,
over Brooklyn.

1924
Despite a homer and three doubles by Rogers Hornsby the Cardinals lose to
Brooklyn, 7-4. It is Hornsby's 24th homer of the year.

1925
For the 2nd time in 3 years, Pittsburgh's Max Carey swipes 2B, 3B and home
in the same inning. Lee Meadows does the rest, shutting out Boston, 2-0.

1926
Senators hurler Walter Johnson (408) bests Red Faber (197) and the White
Sox at Griffith Stadium, 9-3. The veterans pitchers have accumulated the
largest amount of victories, a total of 605 victories, for two hurlers who
start the same game, a record which will not be broken until Tom Seaver
faces Don Sutton in 1986.

Pittsburgh RF Paul Waner goes 6 for 6, including 2 doubles and a triple,
in a 15-7 win against the Giants. Waner uses 6 different bats to accomplish
his feat. Bucs P Lee Meadows is doubled up at 2B when he tries to advance
on a ground out. He gives up 5 runs to New York in the next inning.

1927
The Boston Braves defeat the Pirates, 6-4. Paul Waner, who had a perfect 4
for 4 in yesterday's 2nd game loss, starts off today with 3 straight hits
before making an out. Ed Brown continues his consecutive games played with
his 8th straight one-inning appearance. He'll be back in the lineup tomorrow.

1929
In the 8th inning of a 5-5 game at Wrigley Field, Cubs 3B Norm McMillan hits
a line drive down the LF line with the bases loaded. Reds LF Evar Swanson,
shaded toward center, can't find the ball, which he sees bounce off a gutter
in foul territory. McMillan circles the bases and 4 runs score. Later,
Cubs relief P Ken Penner picks up his jacket in the bullpen and discovers
the ball in his right sleeve. It is Chicago's 8th grand slam of the year.

Albert G. Mills, NL president 1883-84, author of the National Agreement
and original reserve rule that governed baseball's early years, dies at 84.

1930
Hack Wilson has 4 RBIs to lead the Cubs over the Pirates, 7-5. Wilson
cracks a 2-run single in the 5th, but then allows a Lloyd Waner liner to
skip by him for an inside-the-park-HR, and vows to atone. He hits his 44th
HR, off young Larry French, breaking Chuck Klein's one-year-old NL record.

In San Francisco, Dolf Camilli's brother, Frankie, dies after a boxing
match yesterday with heavyweight Max Baer. Fighting under the name Frankie

1935
In the opener of a twinbill, lumbering 1B Zeke Bonura of the White Sox
steals home with 2 outs in the 15th inning to beat the Yankees' Jimmy
DeShong, 9-8. New York takes a 7-5 lead in the 13th on a 2-run single by
George Selkirk, but Selkirk's error following a Luke Appling single and
Bonura's double ties the match up. The Yanks go ahead, 8-7, in the top of
the 15th on Gehrig's 2nd homer of the game, off Whit Wyatt. A single by
Appling and a walk to Bonura starts the 15th; and Zeke surprises everyone
by nabbing his 4th career stolen base. New York takes the nitecap, 7-5,
in 7 innings. Gehrig has a 2 homers, a double and 3 singles for the afternoon.

Pittsburgh player-manager Pie Traynor leads the way with a grand slam and
4 singles to drive in six runs as the Bucs top the Giants, 10-2.

1936
In the 5th inning at Pittsburgh, Brooklyn rookie Eddie Wilson is struck in
the head by a fastball from Mace Brown and suffers a skull fracture ending
his season. Wilson, hitting .347, will play just 36 more major league
games. The Dodgers score 9 runs in the 5th inning to win, 10-3.

1938
The last-place Phils take their 3rd straight game from the front-running
Pirates, winning 6-4 at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh now leads the Giants by 4
1/2 games.

1939
The first ML telecast of a game occurs at Ebbets Field as the Reds play
the Dodgers in a doubleheader. Red Barber broadcasts the game over W2XBS,
the 2 referring to the number of sets able to view the game:  one is in
the press box, while the other, at the RCA Pavilion in Rockefeller Center,
attracts a huge crowd. The Dodgers win the first game, 5-2, and the Reds
take the 2nd, 6-1, behind Bucky Walters 2-hitter.

1940
Bucky Walters pitches the first-place Reds to a 3-2 win over the lowly

single. Ancient - 40 in December - Syl Johnson then holds the Reds to three
hits to win the nitecap, 6-1.

Bob Feller rescues Mel Harder in the 7th and the Indians top the Senators,
4-3. Hal Trosky's two-run homer off Dutch Leonard is the big blow for the
Tribe. Cleveland leads the idle Tigers by 3 games.

on 4 hits to give the Cubs an 11-3 win over the Phils. The Cubs win the
opener, 5-4.

loses to the Red Sox, 9-4. Williams is 1 for 1.

1942
Johnny Beazley wins his 16th game of the year, 2-1, over the Dodgers in
10 innings. The win caps a sweep of Brooklyn, with Max Lanier having edged
Larry French in the opener 2 days before.

1945
Red Sox pitcher Boo Ferriss wins his 20th game, beating the A's, 4-3, and
doubling home the game winner in the 10th inning. The Sox take the nitecap,

5 hits for the day, including two homers and a double.

Before a standing room only crowd of 42,998 at Wrigley, the Cardinals down
the Cubs, 5-1, behind Red Barrett's 5 hitter, and cut Chicago's lead to 2

Cardinals P Murry Dickson beats the Dodgers, 2-1, to move St. Louis into
1st place.

1947
Recently signed by the Dodgers, former Memphis Red Sox (Negro League) P
Dan Bankhead becomes the first black ML hurler. The Pirates rock Bankhead
for 10 hits and 8 runs in 3 1/3 relief innings, but Bankhead joins a small
list of players who homer in their first ML at-bat. Bankhead's HR, off Fritz
Ostermueller, is the only one he'll hit in the majors. Pittsburgh wins, 16-3.

Veteran Ray Poat, purchased from Baltimore (IL) yesterday, pitches the Giants
to a 6-4 win over the Cardinals at the Polo Grounds. Poat helps his cause
with a homer and a triple. As noted by researcher Madison McEntire, Poat's
only other hits this year will be a double and a single, giving him a season
cycle, the first player to do so. The next will be Bruce Kison, in 1978.

1948
The Cubs sweep two from the Braves, 5-1 and 5-2, despite a near-riot that
holds up play for 20 minutes in the nitecap. The reaction by the fans comes
when Jocko Conlan rules that a drive by Phil Cavarretta in the 3rd inning is
a ground-rule double, not an inside-the-park homer. Conlan makes his call
after Braves LF Jeff Heath "loses" the ball in the Wrigley vines, though
it is really by his feet. The fans shower the field in protest and Conlan
bawls out some of Chicago's finest for not taking any action. When play is
resumed, Andy Pafko walks and Peanut Lowrey hits a bases-loaded triple.

1949
The Red Sox sweep a pair from the Chisox, winning 11-4 and 10-7, and now
trail the Yankees by 1 1/2 games. Mel Parnell takes the opener, becoming
the majors' first 20-game winner this year. Ted Williams blasts his 31st
and 32nd homers in the opener and is now just one behind teammate Vern
Stephens. Bobby Doerr has 4 hits and 4 RBIs. In the second game Chicago's
Bob Kuzava opens by allowing a run on a walk and 2 singles, then ties an
AL mark last accomplished by Feller in 1938 by striking out six straight
batters (Stephens, Doerr, Zarilla, Goodman, Matt Batts, Kinder). Later he is
hit by an Al Zarilla line drive and taken to a hospital with bruised ribs,
but not before losing to Ellis Kinder (16-5). The Bosox pound out 16 hits,
including 3 more by Williams (.356), and 4 by Johnny Pesky.

The Indians down the visiting Yankees, 5-3, behind Al Benton. Vic Raschi
strikes out 8 but loses his 5th game in his last 8 starts.

The Giants' Larry Jansen wins his 14th, stopping the league-leading Cards,
4-2, on five hits. Bobby Thomson and Marty Marion match homers, but the
fireworks come when Durocher, Fitzsimmons, Hank Behrman and Wes Westrum
are ejected for various arguments in the 2nd and 3rd.

The Cubs trip the Dodgers, 4-2, routing Joe Hatten in the 3rd inning. Hank
Sauer knocks in the first three runs, twice tripping up the shift and
hitting to RF. The last run comes on a successful double steal, with Andy
Pafko scoring on the front end. Bob Rush and Bob Muncrief, the winner,
collaborate on a six-hitter.

bests Robin Roberts.

In the 2nd game against the Yanks, veteran infielder Bert Haas hits a pinch
homer in the 6th for the White Sox, his last ML at-bat. The Sox will release
the 37-year-old tomorrow. The Yanks win, 8-6, to remain a game behind the
Indians. The Sox take the opener, 3-2, behind Saul Rogovin.

At the Polo Grounds, Chuck "The Rifleman" Connors clubs his 2nd and last
ML homer, a three-run shot off Sal Maglie in the 9th to give the visiting
Cubs a temporary 4-4 tie. Wes Westrum then answers with his 2nd homer of
the game, off reliever Walt Dubiel, and New York wins, 5-4. New York takes
the nitecap, 5-1, to run their victory streak to 14 games. Jim Hearn tops
Cal McLish. Mays electrifies the crowd in the 6th by singling, advancing
on a balk and a short fly, and stealing home. The Giants trail by six games.

The Pirates club the Dodgers, 12-11, to win the opener of two with the league
leaders. Brooklyn chases Howie Pollet and takes a 9-2 lead but the Bucs roar
back with 8 runs in the 7th inning. Light-hitting Pete Castiglione does the
early damage with a 2-run homer and solo shot before the 8-run 7th. Clyde
King, unscored on in his last 8 games, is the loser. The Dodgers load the
bases in the 9th, and Murry Dickson walks PH Cal Abrams to force in a run
and make the score 12-11. But Furillo and Reese fail to deliver. Brooklyn
wins the second game, 4-3, when Jackie Robinson homers in the 10th, off
Ted Wilks. Andy Pafko homers in the 8th, off Bob Friend, and Preacher Roe
(17-2) goes all the way.

1953

hit the 4 in the 7th scoring 10 runs and go on to rip the Athletics,
16-0. Willard Nixon is the beneficiary of the blasts by Frank Malzone,
Norm Zauchin, Ted Lepcio and Jim Piersall.

In New York, Yankee-killer Frank Lary stops New York as Detroit wins,
5-2. Lary allows just a 2-run homer in the first inning to Mantle that reaches
the upper deck in CF. The New York lead is now down to 3 1/2 games, as they
start a crucial series in Chicago. They will win all 3 games with the Sox.

1959

4-4 tie with an 8th-inning HR. Jim Perry, in relief of Gary Bell, picks up
the win, 5-4, over New York.

It's "Al Smith Day" at Comiskey, with every fan named Smith, Schmidt,
Smythe or Smithe admitted free and given a button stating "I'm a Smith and

lose to Boston, 7-6. Bill Monboquette is the winner.

1960

San Diego (PCL) pitcher Al Worthington throws a no-hitter against Hawaii.

1962
At Metropolitan Stadium, the Twins' Jack Kralick no-hits the A's and wins,
1-0, on Lenny Green's sacrifice fly off Bill Fischer. A 3-2 walk to George
Alusik with one out in the 9th spoils Kralick's bid for a perfect game. Alusik
had beaten Kralick with a 2-run HR on August 8. Fischer, meanwhile, walks
no one as his walkless streak continues. This is the Twins' first no-hitter
since the franchise moved to Minnesota last season, and the fifth no-no
hurled this season in the major leagues.

Robin Roberts, discarded earlier in the year by the Yankees, beats Whitey
Ford, 2-1, on HRs by Brooks Robinson and Jim Gentile to complete a 5-game
Oriole sweep of the sagging Yankees. The Twins and Angels are now 3 games
behind New York.

At Chicago, Dick Ellsworth stops the Braves, 4-1, and stops Hank Aaron's
hitting streak of 25 games. The Cubs tie a ML record and set an NL mark
with 3 straight sacrifice bunts in the 6th inning following a bunt single
by Ellsworth. Hubbs lays down the first sac bunt, and is safe on a fielder's
choice.

After the Indians beat the Red Sox, 10-5, in game 1, Cleveland's Dick
Donovan holds the Red Sox homerless in the nitecap to win, 4-0. It is

1965
At Shea Stadium, the Mets beat the Dodgers, 5-2, making Tug McGraw (2-2)
the first Mets pitcher to defeat Sandy Koufax (21-7). Previously, New York
had lost 13 consecutive times to the future Hall of Fame southpaw.

1966
After seeing a caricature of himself on the scoreboard, an angry Leo Durocher
calls the Astrodome's press box to have it removed. When nothing is done,

it onto the infield.

With Baltimore trailing Boston, 2-0, in the 9th inning, Vic Roznovsky and Boog
Powell sting Lee Stange with back-to-back pinch-hit HRs to tie the game. This
is just the 4th time in baseball history that back-to-back pinch HRs have
occurred, and the 2nd time in the AL. Baltimore wins in the 12th, 3-2.

Detroit's Earl Wilson, winner of six straight, hits an 8th-inning homer to
give himself a 5-3 lead over New York. But the Yankees, batting against
reliever Hank Aguirre in the 9th, tally one run on a Clete Boyer single,
and win it, 6-5, when Mantle clouts a pinch homer over a leaping Al Kaline
in RF. The win still leaves New York (57-72) in last place.

the first 5 batters in the game. But the Dodgers win the game, 4-0.

a pitch in the 2nd with the bases loaded to bring home the first run.

In their first of two straight doubleheaders, Dave McNally makes it easy in
the opener by belting a first-inning grand slam off the A's Chuck Dobson. The
O's score 7 runs in the inning and beat the A's, 8-2. The A's come back in
the nitecap, winning 2-0 behind Catfish Hunter and Segui.

The Phils take a 5-0 lead over the Reds, only to lose, 6-5. Jim Beauchamp
hits a run-scoring single in the 7th for the winner.

1969
Willie McCovey drives in 6 runs with homer #40 (a grand slam), a sac fly and a
single, while Bobby Bonds drives in another 5 as the Giants bomb the Phils,
13-4. The win is the Giants' 6th in a row and they keep their half game
lead in the NL West. McCovey's slam - his 2nd of the year - is his career
10th and his 6 RBIs ups his season total to 106. Perry (16-10) is the winner.

1970
In the Reds' 6-5 win over the visiting Phillies, Jim Merritt notches his
20th win of the year. Jim Bunning takes the loss. Merritt is the first Reds
lefty to win 20 since 1925, but will be 6-26 the rest of his career.

1972
Ron Santo's three-run homerun off Ron Bryant proves to be the difference in
the Cubs' 10-9 victory over San Francisco at Wrigley Field. The third-inning
round-tripper, the first of a pair he hits in the game, is the third
baseman's 2,000th career hit, and his 1,200th RBI.

Leo Durocher, formerly of the Cubs, replaces Harry Walker as manager of

drives in 9 runs as the Orioles crush the Angels 17-3. Dennis Martinez goes
8 innings for the win, while John Candelaria is lit up for 7 runs in 1 2/3
innings. The Birds total 7 homers in the game to tie a team record set May
17, 1967 and Murray's 9 ribbies ties a team mark set by Jim Gentile.

Cesar Cedeno.

1987
Paul Molitor goes 0 for 4 in Milwaukee's 1-0 10-inning win over the Indians,

The Yankees reluctantly agree to a record $1.55 million contract with
19-year-old high school southpaw Brien Taylor, the overall number one pick
from the June amateur draft. It is the largest deal ever given to an amateur
player, surpassing the $1.2 million paid to Todd Van Poppel by Oakland in
1990. George Steinbrenner is outraged by the deal, but the suspended owner
actually had driven up the price when he publicly makes his wishes known
to Newsday two days prior to the signing by saying, "If they (Gene Michael)
let him go, they ought to be shot".

Bret Saberhagen of the Royals hurls a no-hitter against the White Sox,
winning by a 7-0 count. He strikes out 5 while walking only 2. Charlie Hough
takes the loss for Chicago, becoming the 7th pitcher in history to wind up
on the losing side of more than one no-hitter. Saberhagen also becomes the
3rd pitcher in history to throw a no-hitter, win a Cy Young Award, and be
named World Series MVP, joining Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson. In the fifth

1996
With a ten-year $20 million deal, Pro Player, the sports apparel division of
Fruit of the Loom, becomes the first sports marketing and products company
to have its name used as the moniker for a stadium. The renaming of Joe
Robbie Stadium, the home of the Florida Marlins, to Pro Player Stadium
sparks controversy as many Miamians believe the name of the benefactor,
whose name will be removed, should still be included due to his generosity
and efforts to fund the original project.

The Mets replace Dallas Green as their manager with Bobby Valentine,
a former coach who left the organization to manage in Texas. During his

in seven innings in a 12-2 victory over the Marlins. It is Johnson's 14th win.

and 51st of the season. In doing so, he joins Mark McGwire (1996-99) and

feat. With a solo shot in fourth inning in a 10-3 victory over the Rangers,

medical unit arrives. Trailing 7-0 early in the game, the Phillies rally to
beat the Mets, 8-7. Chris Coste, who goes 4 for 4 after entering the game
as a pinch hitter in the 8th inning, delivers the walk-off single in the
bottom of the 13th to put Philadelphia back into first place, a half a game
ahead of New York. Driving in Damion Easley with a fourth-inning groundout,
Mets infielder David Wright becomes the first player in franchise history
to have four 100-RBI seasons. The 25-year-old has reached the plateau every

character sporting dreadlocks stops to high-five fans sitting in the right
