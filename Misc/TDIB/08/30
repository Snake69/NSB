1906
Righthander Slow Joe Doyle of the Highlanders sets a ML record as the first
20th-century player to start out with 2 shutouts when he beats the Washington
Senators, 5-0. These are his only 2 wins this year as he goes 2-1. Of his
23 lifetime victories, 7 will be shutouts. He is nicknamed "Slow" because
of his time-consuming pace on the mound. Behind the hitting of Hal Chase,
who has a ML record tying 3 triples + a double, the Highlanders take the
nitecap as well, 9-8, in 10 innings to begin a sweep of 5 doubleheaders in
6 days. They'll outscore their opponents, 76-31.

crowded onto the field. "Many women were injured and their hats demolished,"
wrote the New York World. Chicago wins its 9th straight to pull to a half-game

The Giants score 6 runs against Alexander, but the Phillies come back
from the 6-0 deficit to score 8 against Mathewson. With 2 outs in the top
of the 9th, and the Phils leading 8-6 over New York, umpire Bill Brennan,
acceding to a request by the wily John McGraw, orders Phils captain Mickey
Doolan (Phils manager Red Dooin had been ejected during the 6-run 6th) to
have spectators removed from the CF bleachers, where they are waving hats,
newspapers, handkerchiefs and flashing mirrors to distract the batters. When
Doolan refuses, Brennan forfeits the game, 9-0, to the Giants. Bedlam ensues
and later, when the two umpires and Giants players try to board the train
at the North Philadelphia Station, they are attacked by fans. The police
draw their revolvers to control the crowd. The Phils protest the forfeit
and NL president Lynch will reverse the umpire and rule the game an 8-6
Phils win. The Giants then appeal. NL directors say both Brennan and Lynch
are wrong, and order the game completed from the point at which it was
stopped. The game will be finished October 2, with the Giants winning.

his two wins today, Mays begins an AL-record winning streak of 24 straight
victories over Philadelphia, and will not lose to them until July 24, 1923,
when he pitches for the Yankees. The record books show 23 straight wins,
but historian Lyle Spatz will find that the correct total is 24.

The Indians play 2 postponed games with the Tigers, doubling the Bengals
in both, 2-1 and 4-2. Coveleski allows 4 hits in the opener and Bagby 7 in
the nitecap.

At the Polo Grounds, in the 2nd fastest NL game ever, the Giants beat
Brooklyn, 1-0, in 57 minutes behind the pitching of Pol Perritt, scoring

record will be set on September 25, 1926 and matched the next day.

1997
Yankee P David Wells strikes a familiar note as he threatens to punch
out owner George Steinbrenner during a clubhouse argument. Reportedly,
the argument begins after the team's 7-2 loss to the Expos, when a play
occurs that was similar to last year's ALCS. This time it was against the
Yankees ... Darrin Fletcher gets a homerun when a fan in right field reaches
over and snags the ball before Paul O'Neill can catch it. Wells opines to
Steinbrenner that extra security should be added in RF to prevent this sort
of thing, George answers that Wells ought to stick to his pitching. When
Wells says that Steinbrenner could trade him, the owner answers that no
one wanted the lefty. It was then that Wells joins the ranks of earlier
Yankees who have wanted to flatten the feisty owner.

which took 2 years off, made just weeks before the boy entered the United
States. Continued protests of racism against Dominicans prompts further
investigations which will show that Almonte and others did not even attend
school in the Bronx, did not play the requisite number of games with their

play in 1988 for using overage players, and that Danny's older brother was

away, Bud Selig announces the players' union and owners have reached a

pouring from the dugouts and stands. The Mexican dugout empties and the
