the top of the 6th.

A's pitcher Jack Coombs hits another extra-inning round tripper, this time in
the 11th off the Tigers' Ralph "Judge" Works. The Tigers win, 9-8, on Coombs'
error. Coombs' homer is the last one hit at Detroit's Bennett Park. Among
major league pitchers, only Dizzy Dean will hit two extra-inning homers. Jim
Delahanty, Tiger 3B, sets a ML record by making an unassisted DP for the 2nd
day in a row. Another Tiger, Marv Owen, in 1934, will be the next to do it.

1920
In St. Louis, Yankee P Jack Quinn loses his spitter and in the 6th when a
drizzle starts, Carl Mays relieves for New York with the score 2-2. Despite 2

1924
With most of the 30,000 fans at Yankee Stadium cheering the underdog
Senators, Walter Johnson holds New York scoreless for 7 innings. In the

5-1. Goslin has another three hits and scores 3 runs as the Senators now
lead by 1 1/2 games.

1925
After a night on the town, Babe Ruth shows up late for batting
practice. Miller Huggins suspends Ruth and slaps a $5,000 fine on him
for disobeying orders on the field and team rules off the field. In the
showdown between the Bambino and the tiny manager, Jake Ruppert backs up
his manager. Ruth is forced to apologize before he's reinstated 9 days
later. The day after his return to the lineup, Ruth hits HR number 300.

inning to give the Giants a 7-6 win over the Cardinals.

1927
In St. Louis, the Yankees win their 18th game against the Browns without
a loss, 8-3. Loser Milt Gaston gives up a homer to Gehrig, his 41st, and
makes 2 errors. The Yankees will win 21 games against the Browns this year,
an AL record.

The Giants take 2 from the Cubs, 8-7 and 4-1 in 8 innings. Clarence "Heinie"
Mueller, uncle of future Giant Don Mueller, leads the way in the opener by
hitting a pinch HR in the 3rd as the Giants bat around. Mueller adds a 2-run

1930
In the Cubs' 2nd successive extra-inning game, Pat Malone beats Burleigh
Grimes, 9-8 in 13 innings, to halt the Cardinals' 9-game win streak. With
captain Charlie Grimm out of the lineup with a spike wound, the Cubs sign
George Kelly, released a month earlier by the Reds.

A little comedy is injected into an 11-inning 9-8 Braves victory over
the Phillies. The Braves' Rabbit Maranville makes the 3rd out of the 4th
inning in a steal attempt at 2B. He argues vigorously and at length. Fresco
Thompson of the Phils finally tires of it, picks up the scrappy little guy
and carries him to his position at SS.

White Sox P Pat Caraway shuts out the Indians, 3-0, but he has to go 13
innings to do it.

1931
In his first start following his loss, Lefty Grove fans the side (Byrd,
Sewell, Ruth) in the 1st inning, hands out a walk to Gehrig to start the
2nd, and records 3 more K's (Chapman, Lary, Dickey). Lefty has 2 K's in
the 3rd but develops a blister from gripping the ball. Gehrig knocks Grove
out of the box with a 6th-inning grand slam, but the A's lefty still wins,
7-4. Lou now has 142 RBIs. Jimmie Foxx knocks in 5 runs for the A's.

Cub Billy Herman's ML debut is a knockout. He singles in his first at-bat and
in his 2nd plate appearance, Herman fouls a ball off his head (off pitcher
Si Johnson) and has to be carried off the field. The Cubs beat the Reds, 14-5.

1932
Against the A's, Detroit C Ray Hayworth makes his first error of the season
after handling 439 chances without a miscue dating back to September 2,
1931. The 2 teams split, the Mackmen taking the opener, 8-3, with 6 runs
in the 8th, and the Tigers winning game 2, 10-7, with 3 runs in the 9th.

1933
The split between P George Earnshaw and Connie Mack gets wider when the A's
announce the pitcher's retirement for the season. Earnshaw has been sent
home twice from road trips. The rift started last winter when Earnshaw
picked the Yankees to win the pennant. Mack says, "Earnshaw will get his
check on the first and fifteenth of the month but I don't want to see him
at Shibe Park. I'm tired of looking at him."

In St. Louis, the last-place Browns beat the Red Sox, 10-8, then lose the
nitecap, 9-4. The Brownies will draw just 88,000 (79,000+ paying) fans in
1933, the worst attendance numbers since the 1890s.

The Chicago Cubs (versus the Brooklyn Dodgers) feature Billy Herman playing
second base, Babe Herman playing right field and Leroy Herrmann pitching.

1934
A capacity crowd at Shibe Park sees Detroit's Schoolboy Rowe fail to win his
17th straight. He is knocked from the box in the 7th inning of the 2nd-game,
a 13-5 loss to Philadelphia. The A's slap Schoolboy for 12 hits.

1935
At Philadelphia, the Red Sox top the A's, 6-2, behind Wes Ferrell's 20th
win of the year. Joe Cronin and Dusty Cooke homer off Marcum.

1937
The A's set a new AL record in the opener of a doubleheader with the White
Sox by scoring 12 runs in the first inning, an AL-record 6 of which are
driven in by Bob Johnson on a grand slam and a 2-run double. Johnson is 5
for 6 as the A's whitewash the White Sox, 16-0, another AL record.

By routing the Reds the Giants move within 2 percentage points of the Cubs,
who split with the Phils. After the first game loss, 10-3, the Cubs drop
out of 1st for the 1st time since July 15.

1939
Detroit snaps the Yankees' win streak at 10 games by beating the visiting New
Yorkers, 8-7. DiMaggio, hitting .408, hits a 3-run HR in the 9th to tie it,
but the Bengals score off reliever Spud Chandler. After going 16-3 in their
last 19 games, the Yankees now lead the AL by 12 lengths. During that span,
the Yankees have scored an impressive 125 more runs than they've allowed.

1944
The Cardinals beat the Reds, 3-0, as Ted Wilks (14-1) wins his 11th in a row.

Braves 3B Damon Phillips has 11 assists, and no putouts or errors, versus
the Giants, equaling a 19th-century mark (James White, 1884; Jerry Denny,
1890). The Giants win, 4-2, behind Bill Voiselle. All the scoring comes on
homers:  Holmes, Ott and a 3-run homer by Lombardi.

Dizzy Trout drives in 5 runs - on a homer, double and single - and pitches
a 9-hit shutout over the White Sox, 7-0. It is his 22nd victory and moves
the Tigers to 4 games in back of the leading Browns.

1946
The Cubs beat Brooklyn, 3-2, for their 2nd win in a row over Brooklyn,
and their 7th overall. Hank Borowy is the winner over Vic Lombardi.

St. Louis ace Howie Pollet shuts out New York, 4-0, to give St. Louis a 2
1/2 game lead over the Dodgers.

1947
In St. Louis, Freddie Hutchinson does it all for Detroit, whipping the
Browns, 5-4. After tripling against Ellis Kinder in the 3rd, Hutch takes
advantage of the pitcher's big windup to swipe home. He is the first pitcher
to triple and steal home. He also adds a single.

1948
The Dodgers sweep a doubleheader, 12-7 and 6-4, against the Cardinals to
take over first place ahead of the Braves by 3 percentage points. In the
first game, Jackie Robinson hits for the cycle, scores 3 runs, drives in 2,
and swipes 3B. The Cardinals use 42 players, a major league record, in the
two games, with Brecheen and Munger taking the losses. With the Braves losing
a pair to the Pirates, 6-1 and 5-2, Boston's lead shrinks to a half-game over
Brooklyn. In the AL, only 2 games separate the Red Sox, Indians and Yankees.

Playing their third doubleheader in three days, the Giants drop a pair to
the Reds, both by 3-2 scores.

1951
The Yankees trade rookie hurler Lew Burdette along with $50,000 to the
Braves for right-hander Johnny Sain. Burdette will come back to haunt the
Bronx Bombers pitching three complete-game victories in the 1957 World
Series won by Milwaukee in seven games.

Park. Mantle has four RBIs including a three-run homer in the 9th off
Satchel Paige. Ned Garver (15-9) is the loser.

Pitching on 2-days rest, the Giants' Jim Hearn tops 17-game winner Murry
Dickson, 3-1. It is Hearn's 8th straight over Pittsburgh stretching back

At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers roll to a 13-1 win over the Reds behind Don
Newcombe. Gil Hodges drives in 7 runs and hits his 35th and 36th homers to
tie Ralph Kiner for the homer lead. He also sets a Dodger club record. Reese
has 3 RBIs to run his total to 77.

1954
Giants Dusty Rhodes ties a record with 6 extra base hits - 2 doubles,
2 triples, and 2 HRs - in a doubleheader, as the Giants split with the

triples in two at-bats in the opener. The split leaves the Giants just 1
1/2 games ahead of Brooklyn.

Orioles bespectacled C Clint Courtney goes 5 for 5, as Baltimore defeats
the Senators, 5-0.

A disappointed crowd of 45,922 at Milwaukee's County Stadium sees the

NL attendance mark of 1,841,666 on their way to a season total of 2,131,388.

1956

first-inning error had allowed four unearned runs to score.

1957
In New York, Hank Bauer hits Dick Donovan's first pitch of the game for a

1961
At Milwaukee, the Braves take over 3rd place from the Giants with a 13-inning
7-6 victory. Eddie Mathews ends the game with his 26th homer. For SF,
Willie McCovey cracks his 16th homer for his 3rd hit of the game, and the
20th hit in 45 at-bats since his return to the Giants' lineup. The Braves
recognize a hot bat when they see one and, with 1st base open in the 11th,
walk McCovey to get to Mays. Mays earlier drove in his 100th run, but
grounds out to end the inning.

1963

Ruth's career strikeout record (1,330) in the nightcap.

1965
Giants center fielder Willie Mays breaks Ralph Kiner's record for home runs
in a month when the 'Say Hey Kid' hits a moon shot off Jack Fischer for his
17th round tripper (41st overall) in an 8-3 victory over New York. The former
Pirates outfielder, now a broadcaster for the Mets on WHN radio and WOR-TV,
calls the round tripper which breaks the mark he established in 1949 with
16 round-trippers in the month of September.

The White Sox take a pair from Boston by 3-2 scores with rookie Bob Locker
saving both games. Shortstop Ron Hansen handles 28 chances in the 2 games,
a ML record, and his 18 chances in the 14-inning opener ties the ML record
for extra innings.

1966
In San Francisco, the Beatles play their last concert ever, at the Giants'

strikes out 11 Orioles to get his 16th victory.

Chicago Cubs veteran Robin Roberts, acquired recently from Houston,
wins the final victory of his career (in relief), beating the Atlanta
Braves, 4-2. Roberts has now beaten the Braves in all three locations:
12-6 vs. Boston, 21-24 vs. Milwaukee, 1-0 vs. Atlanta (as noted by Joe
Mackay). The future Hall of Famer will retire having giving up 505 HRs,
the only one above 500.

1967
The Red Sox tie an AL record it originally set on July 4, 1905, by playing
29 innings in a doubleheader. Boston wins the first against the Yankees,
2-1, then drop the nightcap in 20 innings, 4-3. The winning pitcher Fred

Clarke's game-winning single. The game lasts 5:15 and is the 3rd game this
year of 18 innings or more for New York.

Phils, 1-0. Vada Pinson doubles in the 7th, and scores on a ground out and
fly out.

still wins, 9-8, in 10 innings. Campy is the first to have 3 triples in an

major league record of 41 consecutive outs.

In game 1 of a twinbill, Yankee Bobby Murcer hits for the cycle against Texas,
with his HR tying the game at 6 apiece in the 9th. The Yanks win, 7-6, in the
11th, on Callison's RBI single. Murcer is the first Yankee to cycle since
Mantle in 1957 ... the next will be Tony Fernandez in 1995. Murcer adds a
HR in the nitecap, but the Rangers score 4 runs off reliever Klimkowski in
the 7th and win, 7-4.

Sox, 3-0. Reggie Smith hits 2 run-scoring doubles off starter Tom Bradley

1977
At Jack Murphy Stadium, 39-year-old Cardinals outfielder Lou Brock steals
two bases breaking the 49-year-old career stolen bases record with his

of the Philadelphia A's at the age of 41. The Cardinals lose today, 4-3,
to the Padres.

Nolan Ryan, who will finish the season fanning 341 batters, strikes out 11
Orioles to pass the 300 mark for the fifth time in his career. The Angel
right-hander's performance isn't enough to prevent a 6-1 loss to Baltimore
at Memorial Stadium.

In the 9-2 victory over the White Sox, the Indians hit 4 homers, two by
Andre Thornton. After four seasons and going to bat 1381 times without a
homer, SS Duane Kuiper clubs a Steve Stone pitch into the RF stands in the
first inning. Kuiper will hang his glove and his .271 average up in 1985,
and will have gone to bat 3379 times with just this one HR. When the Indians

2B Jim Gantner for an inning (no runs), and C Buck Martinez (1 run) in relief.

1980
The Cardinals promote manager Whitey Herzog to general manager, replacing

the Reds, 7-2. Bull Durham drives in 3 runs to pace the Bruin offense.

inning and give the Giants a 4-3 win over the Expos. His line drive tips off
CF Tim Raines' glove and rolls to the wall. The Giants tie the game with
2 outs in the 9th on an error by 3B Wallach. An odd occurrence happens in
the game when Youppi, the Montreal Expos mascot, is ejected.

McCaskill. It is the 190th time the Yankee DH has been plunked which breaks,

The Rangers trade veteran slugger Cliff Johnson to Toronto for 3 minor
leaguers. Johnson had left the Blue Jays after last season to sign with

will drop 2 more with the A's before beating the Indians on September 22.

1989
Giving up just three singles, recently acquired Mets southpaw Frank Viola

reigning winners of the Cy Young Award have faced one another in the
regular season.

Trailing 9-0 after 5 innings, the Cubs rally to beat Houston, 10-9, in 10
innings at Wrigley. Rafael Ramirez drives in 7 runs for the Astros, but
the winning margin is provided by defensive replacement Dwight Smith. Smith
comes in to play RF for Chicago and singles home a run in the 7th, throws
out a runner at the plate in the 8th, ties the game with a sac fly in the
8th, and singles in the game-winner in the 10th.

1990
The defending World Champion A's seemingly lock up another pennant by
acquiring slugger Harold Baines from the Rangers for a pair of minor
leaguers (P Scott Chiamparino and P Joe Bitker) and OF Willie McGee from
the Cardinals for Felix Jose and 2 more minor leaguers (3B Stan Royer and

1993
Joining Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Hank Aaron, George Brett becomes
only the third player in baseball history to swipe his 200th stolen base as

historic heist takes place during in a 5-4 12-inning victory over the Red
Sox at Kauffman Stadium.

1995
Pittsburgh's Paul Wagner hurls a 1-hitter in defeating Colorado, 4-0. He fans
11 and walks 3, and allows just an infield single to Andres Galarraga with

Pirates right-hander will lead the National League in losses this season
posting a 5-16 record for Pittsburgh.
