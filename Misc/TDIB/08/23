1902
Brooklyn collects a record-tying 4 triples in the 3rd inning, all in
succession, and all are needed. The Brooks win, 9-8, over Pittsburgh.

1903
Before 21,400 in St. Louis the Americans sweep St. Louis, 5-3 and 4-2. Boston
executes a triple play in the nitecap. Hughes and Young are the winners
for 1st place Boston.

1906
In Washington D.C., White Sox pitcher Roy Patterson beats Washington, 4-1,
giving Chicago its 19th straight win, an AL record. The streak will be tied
by the 1947 Yankees. Chicago now leads by 5 1/2 games.

1907
The Pirates top the Giants, 4-2 in 10 innings, then win the 2nd game,
1-0, when Howie Camnitz spins a 5-inning no-hitter. The Bucs score when Ed
Abbaticchio singles home Honus Wagner, who had singled and stolen 2B. The
Giants also lose Frank Bowerman, hit on the head by a Jack Camnitz pitch. The
doctors predict that the burly catcher will miss the season, but he is back
in action in 3 days.

1909
With lefthander Jim Pastorius pitching, Brooklyn C Bill Bergen throws out 6
(erroneously listed as 7) of 8 base-stealing Cardinals in a 9-1 St. Louis
victory. Bergen's mark is a 20th century high, tied twice in 1915 by Schang
and again by 3 A's catchers on June 18. In the first game of the doubleheader
today, it was Brooklyn's turn as they swipe 6 bases in a 7-0 win. The Cards
steal 2 bases.

It's a day for thievery as the Cubs steal home 3 times in a game at Boston,
tying a ML mark. They waste no time, as Johnny Evers and Del Howard do it
in the first inning, and Solly Hofman in the 9-run 2nd. All three are on
the front end of double steals. Chicago wins, 11-6.

The first place Giants outslug the visiting Reds, 12-9, using a 7-run 4th
to do it. Seymour, McCormick and O'Hara each have two hits in the 4th.

1910
Chicago's Ed Walsh tops Walter Johnson, 1-0, the 3rd straight time Walsh
has beaten the Big Train and Washington by that score.

Left fielder Fred Clarke makes a ML record-tying 4 OF assists for Pittsburgh
against the Phils as the Bucs win, 6-2. The Pirates get one more for a NL
record 5 outfield assists.

At St. Louis, Frank Corridon outpitches Christy Mathewson for a 4-1
Cardinals win. The Cards tag Matty for 11 hits. New York is 3 1/2 games
behind 2nd-place Pittsburgh.

The first place Cubs edge the Braves, 3-2, behind the pitching of Ed
Reulbach. Two weeks after setting a team record for consecutive wins,
Reulbach racks up his 10th straight win over the last-place Braves.

1912
The Tigers fall to Washington and Walter Johnson, 8-1. It's the Big Train's
16th win in a row. He is now 29-7.

1914
The Giants lose their 5th straight, to Cincinnati 3-2, and the idle Braves
move into a tie for first place. Herb Moran, playing his last game for Cincy
before being sold to the Braves, doubles in the game-winner in the 9th. The
3rd-place Reds will win all three games with the Giants at Redland Field,
but will soon head in the other direction, losing 19 in a row in September
to finish last.

1915
At the Polo Grounds, the Cardinals sweep two from the Giants, winning 5-4
and 4-3, with reliever Hub Perdue picking up both victories. New York is
in 7th place, 8 1/2 games in back of the leading Phillies.

1916
Ty Cobb goes from 1B to 3B on a teammate's single to LF, then swipes home
when A's 3B Charlie Pick holds the ball. Detroit wins, 10-3.

Babe Ruth picks up his only save of the season, relieving Dutch Leonard in
the 8th with Boston leading the Indians, 6-3. Babe strikes out 3 in the 8th
and doubles and scores in his trip to the plate. He shuts out Cleveland in
the 9th as Boston completes a 4-game sweep of the Tribe.

1917
The Tigers use a triple play to help them beat the A's, 7-3. Stuffy McInnis
hits a liner to Donie Bush to start it. In the 8th, Ty Cobb steals home
against the battery of Tom Sheehan and Val Picinich.

1918
At Fenway Park, the Red Sox break a 9th-inning tie with a two-out double
steal. With Amos Strunk at 2B and Ruth at 1B, the two pull off the theft,
and when Hank Severeid's throw to Maisel is wild, Strunk scores the game
winner. Sad Sam Jones is the winner, 6-5, over reliever Byron Houck.

At Chicago, the Cubs score 2 in the 9th off Red Causey to beat the Giants,
3-2. Bob O'Farrell's triple drives in the winning run, while winning pitcher
Claude Hendrix adds a double and a homerun.

At Cincinnati, Phils rookie Irish Meusel hits an inside-the-park grand slam,
the first IP slam in Phils history. But it is not enough as the Reds win, 8-7.

1919
The Tigers pull off a triple steal (Cobb, Heilmann and Chris Shorten)
but the Red Sox counter with a grand slam by Babe Ruth off Hook Dauss,
the longest homer ever hit at Navin Field. But that's all the Sox scoring
as Detroit wins over Boston, 8-4. For the Babe, it is his 4th grand slam
of the year, a Red Sox record not topped this century.

In the first of 2 games, Ed Roush, Reds outfielder, hits a pair of doubles
in the 9th off Phils pitcher Lee Meadows as the Reds win, 8-3. They take
the second game by a 6-1 score.

1920
Cleveland splits a doubleheader in Boston, winning the opener, 2-1, behind
Slim Caldwell. Boston takes the nitecap, 4-3, in 13 innings.

In New York, Carl Mays waits to make his first appearance since the beaning of
Chapman, when a clubhouse boy delivers a note from Ty Cobb. It reads:  "If it
was within my power, I would have inscribed on Ray Chapman's tombstone these
words:  'Here lies a victim of arrogance, viciousness and greed.'" Though
nervous in the early innings, Mays shuts out the Tigers to win, 10-0. He
then issues a statement against his critics on the Tigers and Red Sox:
"Both those clubs have pitchers who have hit more men this year than I
have." Mays has hit six, but Boston's Joe Bush (10) and Howard Ehmke (9)
have more.

This evening the Indians draft a "round robin" letter to circulate throughout
the league (excluding the Yankees). The letter asks the players "to refuse to
participate in any games where Mays is assigned to pitch." All the Indians
sign the letter except for Speaker. The Browns and Senators will support
the Indians, while the Tigers and Red Sox are waiting to see how effective
the boycott is before joining. The A's and the White Sox take the position
that it was an accident.

1923
Reds 2B Sammy Bohne and OF Pat Duncan deny under oath that they have been
approached to throw games with the Giants.

Red Faber holds the A's to 4 singles and the White Sox roll, 10-0, battering
starter Bob Hasty. The Sox swipe 6 bases, 5 in the 3rd inning.

1924
Dazzy Vance fires perhaps the best game of his career, beating the Cubs 6-5 at
Chicago. Vance wins his 10th in a row and strikes out 15, the most in the NL
since 1909, and one more than he did on August 1. He strikes out 6 in a row.

1928
The Giants split with Pittsburgh, winning the opener, 6-3, with a 5-run
burst in the 8th inning sparked by Lefty O'Doul's 2-run homer. Larry Benton
notches his 21st win. The Bucs come back in the nightcap to win, 13-3,
behind Freddy Fussell.

Lefty Grove beats the Indians, 3-1, for his 19th win. Grove is in the groove,
fanning 5 straight batters in the 2nd and 3rd innings. In the 2nd he strikes
out Morgan, Harval and Autry on 9 pitches, then K's Miller and Langford
to start the 3rd. All told, Lefty throws 15 straight strikes (including a
foul), then a ball, and another strike to retire the 5 batters. He allows
8 hits and strikes out 8 for his 11th win in a row.

The rained-out Yankees pick up Tom Zachary on waivers from Washington for
$7,500. Zachary will fill the starter's role of Herb Pennock, currently down
with an attack of neuritis. To make room for the lefty, New York releases
veteran spitballer Stanley Coveleski.

1929
The Cubs buy Lon Warneke, 20, from Alexandria (Cotton State League) for $100.

1930
The Yankees buy Frank Crosetti from the San Francisco Seals but allow him
to play another season in the PCL before reporting. The Yankees will make a
similar arrangement for Joe DiMaggio, buying him from the Seals but waiting
a year before acquiring him in 1936.

The Giants' Fred Lindstrom singles to extend his hitting streak to 24 games,
but Pat Malone tops Carl Hubbell for a 4-2 Cubs win.

George Earnshaw give the A's a 2-0 win over Detroit.

1931
Lefty Grove is frustrated in his effort to win a record-breaking 17th
game in a row, as Jimmy Moore misjudges a routine fly ball by Ski Melillo,
turning it into a 2-out double, to allow the game's lone run. The volatile
Grove is outraged and unforgiving, not at Moore, but that Al Simmons, the
regular OF, missed the game. Dick Coffman of the Browns allows just 3 hits
to win, 1-0. The A's win the nightcap, 10-0, behind Waite Hoyt's 6-hitter.

In St. Louis, the league-leading Cardinals go to 78-44 by sweeping the
Braves. The Birds pound Boston, 16-1, in the opener as Chick Hafey drives
in 8 runs on 5 for 5 hitting, including 2 HRs. One of the homers is a
grand slam. St. Louis takes the nitecap, 1-0, in 11 innings, winning on
Jim Bottomley's HR.

1932
The Cubs have only one assist in a 5-1 win, sweeping the Phillies in 4
straight games. The fielding mark equals the ML record and sets the Cubs
team record.

1934
Joe Moore cracks a 3-run HR off Paul Dean in the 9th inning to give New
York a 5-3 victory over the Cards. The loss leaves the Birds 7 lengths
behind the leading Giants.

Reardon and Sears for arguing with Cincinnati fans on July 11.

1936
The Indians' seventeen-year-old rookie pitcher, Bob Feller makes his first
major league start striking out the first eight batters he faces. 'Rapid
Robert' will finish the game with 15 strikeouts, one shy of the AL record,
as Cleveland beats the Browns, 4-1. Feller walks four and gives up six hits
in beating Earl Caldwell.

1938
At Fenway, the Red Sox roll over the Indians, 13-3, in the first of
2. Pinky Higgins leads the 21-hit attack with 5 hits to back Ostermueller's
pitching. In game 2, Jimmie Foxx has 6 RBIs, and connects for a 9th-inning
grand slam off Hudlin to lead Boston to a 14-12 win. Foxx will homer 9
times against the Tribe this year, an AL record for homers against one club.

1940
The Reds purchase Jimmy Ripple from the Dodgers.

1942
Seven of 16 games played today are shutouts, matching a mark set September
7, 1908. A near-miss is by White Sox veteran Ted Lyons. Taking a regular
Sunday start, he wins his 256th career game, a 3-hit 3-1 complete game
victory over Cleveland. Cub pitchers Claude Passeau and Lon Warneke each
toss 3-0 shutouts against the Reds while Red Sox hurlers Tex Hughson and
Joe Dobson whitewash the A's, winning 2-0 and 7-0.

Walter Johnson pitching to Babe Ruth is the pregame attraction that draws
69,000 for the New York-Washington game at Yankee Stadium that provides
$80,000 for Army-Navy relief. Ruth hits the fifth pitch into the right-field
stands, and then adds one more shot before circling the bases. Sixteen
relief games contribute $523,000 during the season. In the doubleheader
between the Senators and the Yankees, the Senators win the opener, 7-6 and
New York cops the nitecap, 3-0, in 5 1/2 innings.

At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers sweep 2 from their cross-town rivals. In the
first game, the Giants take a 4-2 lead in the 10th on Johnny Mize's 2-run
HR, only to see Dolf Camilli hit reliever Harry Feldman's 1st pitch for a
grand slam and give Dem Bums a 6-4 win. In the 2nd game, the Dodgers score
2 in the 5th to take a 7-5 lead in a game halted by darkness. The Dodgers
now lead St. Louis by 7 1/2 games.

1948
Reds pitcher Harry Gumbert clubs a game-ending 10th-inning homerun to beat
the Phillies, 3-2. It is Gumbert's only hit of the year in 25 at-bats,
and comes off Schoolboy Rowe. It is his 5th lifetime homer.

1951
At Ebbets Field, the Cards finally beat the Dodgers, 4-2. Max Lanier allows
7 hits, including Campanella's 27th homer, in beating Don Newcombe. Newk
won't lose again to the Birds till 1957, winning 12 straight.

1952
At St. Louis, in the Cardinals' 3-1 win over the Giants, New York 3B Bob
Elliott is thrown out of the game for protesting a 2nd-strike call by
ump Augie Donatelli. Bobby Hoffman replaces Elliott, takes a 3rd strike,
and is also thumbed for not liking the umpiring. Veteran Al Brazle (10-3)
has a shutout until the 9th inning as he pitches the Redbirds to their 8th
straight win.

1953
The Red Sox bat pitcher Mel Parnell in the 6th spot against the Senators,

win, 4-3.

Phil Paine, a former Boston Braves pitcher on military service with the

pitches in 9 games for the Nishitetsu Lions:  4 wins, 3 losses, ERA 1.77.

Chattanooga OF Don Grate betters his 1952 record by throwing a baseball
443 feet 3 1/2 inches. Glen Gorbous will beat it in 1957.

1956
Led by Nellie Fox' 7 straight hits, the White Sox sweep the Yankees,
8-3 and 6-4. Mickey Mantle has a bunt single, a triple, and a HR in the
nightcap loss but trails Fox in season hits, 158 to 155. The Mick still
leads in the Triple Crown race.

At Boston, the Sox score a run in the 8th on 3 walks and a sac fly to beat
Cleveland's Bob Lemon, 2-1. He and Mel Parnell (7-3) each allow 3 hits. For
Parnell, it is his last ML win. He'll lose his last 3 decisions and retire
at the end of the year. The little lefty is 71-30 at Fenway, the 4th best
Hub lefty behind Ruth.

At Cincinnati, Don Newcombe wins his 20th, topping the Reds, 6-5. He's the
first 20-game winner in the majors. Reese is replaced at short after he is
hit on the thumb with a pitch.

1957
Angel Macias, a 12-year-old righthander from Monterrey, Mexico, hurls
a perfect 12-inning game over La Mesa, striking out 11 to win the Little
League Championship in Williamsport, PA. In the tourney before Williamsport,
Macias pitched a game lefthanded.

1958
Dodgers P Don Drysdale hits 2 HRs in a 10-1 clipping of the Cards, and has
now homered in each of his last 3 starts. He has 7, tying Don Newcombe's
1955 total. Veteran Gil Hodges hits the 14th grand slam of his career,
a new NL record. It is also the first slam in the history of the Dodgers
on the West Coast.

The Orioles purchase Hoyt Wilhelm (2-7) from the Indians. The knuckleballer
will lead the AL in ERA in 1959.

1959
The Pirates take a doubleheader from the Dodgers, beating Don Drysdale in
both games. As a starter, Drysdale loses the opener, then relieves in game
2. In the 10th inning, with runners on 1st and 3rd and 2 out, Drysdale
hands out an intentional pass to get to Dick Groat, who singles in the
winning run. The win is Face's 16th of the year without a loss tying him
with Hubbell's streak of 1936 and Blackwell's skein in 1947. The 4th-place
Pirates are now 8 games in back of the 1st place Giants.

The Reds beat the Cardinals, 4-3, on Jerry Lynch's 2-run homer in the 8th. Don
Newcombe is the victor. Newk also has 2 hits to give him 201 in his career:
he's the only post-WW2 pitcher who will reach that level.

At Cleveland, the Indians sweep the Red Sox, 1-0 and 6-2. Tito Francona
breaks up a scoreless pitching duel between Jim Perry and Tom Brewer by

homers, including Aaron's 33rd and Mathews' 29th.

1961
Dave Philley ties Sam Lesile's 29-year-old major league record with his

top of the 7th pinch hitting for Hoyt Wilhelm at Municipal Stadium.

Third-place San Francisco pulls within 4 games of first place with a 14-0 rout
of the Reds at Crosley Field, putting the game away with a record-tying salvo
of 5 HRs in the 12-run 9th inning (10 hits in the inning). HRs by 6 different
Giants (Orlando Cepeda, Felipe Alou, Jim Davenport (inside-the-park), Willie
Mays and John Orsino) tie the ML record for a 9-inning game (joining the
1939 Giants and the 1966 Twins). San Francisco's 27 total bases in the 9th
inning are a modern ML record. Juan Marichal is the winner in the cakewalk,
his 7th straight win.

1962
Steve Boros matches the AL record for most errors in an inning by a 3B with
4 but Detroit beats Cleveland, 8-5, as Al Kaline hits 2 HRs.

1963

record. Ken McBride is the recipient of the outburst while Steve Ridzik is
the loser.

previous record of 600. The Braves beat the Dodgers, 6-1.

1964
Mets pitcher Willard Hunter picks up half his career wins (4) today as
New York sweeps the Cubs, 2-1, in 10 innings, and 5-4 in the nitecap. No
one has ever won a pair more efficiently as he totals 1 2/3 innings of
work. Bob Buhl and Don Elston pick up losses. The Cubs lose Ernie Broglio,
who woke up with a locked elbow and will need surgery to repair the ulnar
lateral ligament damage in his elbow. He'll be 1-6 in 1965.

six on strikeouts. In his last three relief appearances, he has retired 30
batters in a row.

1969
The Reds remain in 1st place despite losing their 10th in 14 games as the

costly and Freddie Patek drives in 2 unearned runs with a single.

1970
Roberto Clemente compiles his 2nd straight 5-hit game during an 11-0 pasting
of Los Angeles. He is the first major leaguer this century to collect 10
hits in 2 consecutive games.

How do you spell relief? Don Gullett strikes out 6 straight batters and
pitches 4 innings with no runners reaching base in beating the host Mets,
7-5. Gullett strikes out 8 in the last 4 innings. The Reds win on Jimmy
Stewart's 3-run pinch homer off Tom Seaver.

1972
Chicago's Dick Allen becomes the 4th ML player (Jimmie Foxx, Hank Greenberg
and Alex Johnson are the others) to hit one into the CF bleachers in Comiskey
Park when he connects off New York's Lindy McDaniel. The 2-run homer in the
7th ices the 5-2 win for the Sox. In 1972, all the Chicago Wednesday games
are in the afternoon, and Harry Caray announces them while sitting in the
CF bleachers. Allen's drive misses Caray by just a few rows.

Kansas City's Roger Nelson shuts out the Red Sox, 3-0. Ben Olgivie's single
in the 8th is the only hit off Nelson.

AL East. With the Red Sox losing, the Yankees go ahead by a half game and
will stay in first place to the end.

a single in the 4th for the only safety.

1979
At Cleveland, the A's Rick Langford gives up 6 hits and 6 runs in the
1st inning, including a grand slam to Andre Thornton and a solo by Ron

come back to win, 8-6.

tampering, following remarks Kroc made about potential free agents Joe

$12.7 million. The sale to the Levi Strauss clothing empire will keep the
team in Oakland.

1982

1989
Cincinnati manager Pete Rose agrees to a lifetime suspension from baseball
due to allegations of betting on baseball.

Rick Dempsey homers off Dennis Martinez in the top of the 22nd inning to
break up a scoreless tie and give the Dodgers a 1-0 win over the Expos for
the second-longest shutout in big league history (the Astros blanked the
Mets for 24 frames enroute to a 1-0 win at the Astrodome in 1968). The
game features one thumbing - the umps toss the Expos mascot Youppi in
the 11th for annoying Tommie Lasorda - and he then returns in the 13th
wearing pajamas. He carries a pillow and sleeps on the home dugout roof,
where the umps have restricted him. In the 16th, Larry Walker apparently
scores the game-winner, but the Dodgers appeal - with 2 umps in the tunnel
- and get it. Eddie Murray in the 18th moves the 2B ump and slams a drive
and Walker makes a phantom catch off the padding in RF. Fans stand for three
"seventh-inning stretches" during the ML record (in time, and for a 1-0 game)
6 hours 14 minute game. Other club records are set and several ML records
are noted:  most innings (22) without a walk by the Expos tops the Pirates
(who used one pitcher) against the Giants, July 17, 1914.

1991
The Rangers' 6-1 win over the Royals is marked by an unusual play in the
8th inning. KC's 2B Terry Shumpert is charged with a 4-base error when he

Juan Gonzalez. Gonzalez and the 2 runners in front of him score as the ball
rolls all the way to the warning track.

1992
In his last outing as a Met, David Cone (13-7) gives up 4 runs in 7 innings
in losing to the Padres, 4-3. Cone gives up just 3 hits. Mets Bobby Bonilla
homers in his 4th consecutive game, tying the club mark.

Despite an unassisted DP by CF Brian McRae, the Royals lose to the White Sox,
3-1. Jack McDowell pitches the complete game for his 17th win as Brett and
Ventura match homers.

With the help of Jose Canseco's 4 ribbies, Mike Moore wins his 13th, 7-3,
over Baltimore. Dennis Eckersley gets the last out for his 40th save.
He is the first closer to notch 40 saves in 4 different seasons.

In a Class A Florida State League game, Andy Carter of the Clearwater
Phillies defeats Scott Bakkum of the Winter Haven Red Sox, 1-0. Neither
team gets a hit in what is believed to be the first double no-hitter in
the minors in 40 years.

1993

and 7 errors recorded.

1996
The Yankees obtain P Graeme Lloyd and former Rookie of the Year Pat
Listach from the Brewers in exchange for OF Gerald Williams and pitcher Bob
Wickman. Lloyd is immediately put to work and provides late inning relief
as the first-place Yankees beat the A's, 5-3. The Yanks will officially
complain to the AL that the Brewers sent damaged goods in the 2 players, but
the complaint is ignored. However, the Brewers will take back Listach and
send Ricky Bones to the Yanks on the 29th. The Yanks will file a grievance
over Lloyd's injury next month and the Brewers will send minor leaguer
Danny Perez as compensation. Lloyd will go on to excel in the post-season
when the Yankees win their first World Series since 1978.

1997
For the 2nd day in a row, Rangers LF Rusty Greer hits a pair of HRs and
posts 6 ribbies, doing so in today's 13-8 win over Chicago.

1998
Barry Bonds becomes the first player in major league history to hit 400
homeruns and steal at least 400 bases (438). The Giant slugger reaches the
unmatched plateau with his 26th homer of the year against Marlin southpaw
Kirt Ojala in a 10-5 San Francisco victory.

At County Stadium against the Padres, Bob Hamelin hits his fourth pinch-hit
homerun of the season. It is the most pinch-hit homeruns hit by a single
Brewer player in a season and is also the all-time franchise record.

With his 50th and 51st dingers, Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa joins Mark McGwire
(53) of the Cardinals in hitting 50 homeruns making it only the second
time two National League hitters have reached the plateau in the same
season. Pirates outfielder Ralph Kiner and Giants first baseman Johnny Mize
each hit a league-leading 51 round trippers in 1947.

Leadoff man Craig Biggio's double, 2 homeruns and 6 RBIs pace the Astros to
a 13-3 victory over the Cubs. C Brad Ausmus also contributes to the cause
with 4 hits and 5 ribbies for Houston. OF Sammy Sosa hits a pair of homers
for Chicago, giving him 51 on the year.

The Pirates defeat the Cardinals, 4-3, despite 5 hits, including a HR,
by St. Louis 3B Fernando Tatis. Mark McGwire also hits his 53rd homer for
the Cards.

1999
Joining Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire, Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Jr
becomes the third player in major league history to hit 200 homers in a
four-season span. Junior's 39th helps Seattle beat the Indians, 4-1.

The Padres edge the Phillies, 7-6. Philadelphia 3B Scott Rolen strikes out
5 times in the game.

The Yankees score 6 runs in the 1st inning on their way to a 21-3 victory
over the Rangers. 3B Scott Brosius (6) and C Joe Girardi (7) - the 8th
and 9th batters in the NY lineup - drive in 13 of the Yankee runs. Jeter
scores his 100th run of the year, the 1st Yank to string together 4 straight
seasons of 100+ runs since Mantle did it in 9 straight seasons (1953-61).

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig announces that Pete Rose will be invited
to the World Series if he is elected to the All-Century Team. Rose has been
banned from baseball since 1989.

2000
At Comerica Park, fans flee their seats as swarms of small insects invade
the stands during the first inning. The six-legged pests do not affect the
players, and the game continues uninterrupted with the Tigers edging the
Mariners, 6-5.

Team president Bob Graziano apologizes to a female couple who were asked
to leave Dodger Stadium on August 8th because the two shared a kiss
during a game. The pair felt the action of the eight security guards was
discriminatory because the couple's friends, a man and a woman, also kissed
but were not ejected.

2001
The Pirates defeated the Diamondbacks, 5-1, despite a 16-strikeout performance
in 7 innings of work by Randy Johnson (ending his 8-game winning streak). In
doing so, Johnson becomes the first pitcher in history to fan 300 in 4
straight seasons.

Barry Bonds and Shawon Dunston of the San Francisco Giants became just the
12th pair of teammates to hit back-to-back homers as pinch hitters when
they go deep in the top of the ninth. Bonds' pinch homer is his first since
1989 and snaps a 5-5 tie. It is also his 549th HR, moving him ahead of Mike
Schmidt into 8th place. The Giants win, 10-5.

In a 6-2 loss to the Blue Jays, it is a busy night for Twins CF Torii
Hunter. Hunter throws out consecutive runners as Darren Fletcher and Homer
Bush both try to stretch singles. Later in the inning he bobbles a ball
for an error. Roy Halladay is the winning pitcher.

In his ML debut, Rockies rookie Jason Jennings is near perfect, shutting
out the Mets, 10-0, and going 3 for 5 including a 9th-inning HR off Donnie
Wall. The former Golden Spikes award winner becomes the first pitcher since
1900 to hurl a shutout and hit a HR in his first big league game.

2002
Cleveland's rookie C Josh Bard hits a game-winning 2-run HR in the bottom of
the 9th inning against Seattle in his 1st ML appearance. The Tribe wins, 4-2.

The Padres score 9 runs in the 5th inning on their way to an 18-2 win
over the Marlins. Bubba Trammell, who has 2 homers in the game, starts the
scoring in the 5th with a homer. 7 players have RBIs in the 5th, and the
last 11 hitters come up with the bases loaded. Jake Peavy is the easy winner.

Bobby Abreau hits a solo homer in the 14th to give the Phillies a 5-4 win
over the Cards in 5 hours 13 minutes. Scott Rolen is 4 for 5 in his 1st
appearance against his old team.

The Orioles spot the Blue Jays 6 runs and then roar back with 4 homers to win,
11-7. The win puts Baltimore (63-63) at .500. From here on it'll be downhill.

2003
The Phillies beat the Cardinals, 9-4, in the process ending Albert Pujols'
hitting streak at 30 games. It is the longest streak in the ML this
season, and ties him with Stan Musial for the second-longest in St. Louis
history. Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby hit in 33 straight games for the
Cardinals' record. Pujols will go hitless in his next 13 at-bats.

Baltimore beats Mike Mussina and the Yankees, 7-2, behind Rodrigo Lopez'
complete game. Jay Gibbon has a homer and a double. Before the game, the
Yankees retire number 49 in honor of Ron Guidry. The Yanks showered their
former captain with gifts including an SUV, a tractor, golf clubs, a ring
and even throw in some mountain bikes for Guidry's kids. Guidry, who hates
to fly, is given five round trip train tickets from his home in Louisiana
to New York City. 'Louisiana Lightning', who played his entire career in
New York posting a 170-90 record for the Bronx Bombers, is surprised the
club hasn't just honored him with a day but have retired his jersey and
placed a plaque in Monument Park in his honor.

2005
The Twins edge the White Sox, 1-0, despite getting only one hit. Jacque
Jones' leadoff HR in the 8th inning accounts for Chicago's only hit off of
Freddy Garcia.

The Dodgers' Oscar Robles knocks in 4 runs and Jeff Weaver has 3 hits and 3
RBIs to pace LA to an 8-3 win over Colorado. Weaver extends his record to
12-8 while Robles extends his attempted steals streak to 0 for 7. Robles
won't try it again the rest of the year and it will stand as a rookie
record (Dave Meier of the Twins was 0 for 6 in 1985). The Dodgers ignore
the pre-game clubhouse tumult when Milton Bradley lashes back at Jeff Kent
saying, "The problem is he doesn't know how to deal with African American
people. I think that's the cause of everything." Kent had criticized Bradley
regarding his base running in a game against Florida.

With the help of 2 errors in the 9th inning, the Indians beat the Royals,
7-6, to stay in the hunt for the AL Central title. It is their 9th straight
win over KC. Travis Hafner hits a homer in his 6th straight game, tying a
club mark of Jim Thome's. Thome had 7 HRs in his 6 games.

2006
Carlos DelGado's 400th career homerun, his second of the game, proves to
be significant when his fourth-inning grand slam dramatically closes the
gap in the Mets' eventual 8-7 comeback victory over the Cardinals at Shea
Stadium. The bases-loaded homerun is New York's ninth of the season to
establish a new club record.

Joining the 1989 Pirates, the Royals became the second team in big league
history to have a 10-run first inning and not win the game. At Kauffman
Stadium, the home team takes an early 10-1 lead, but is defeated by the
Indians in ten innings, 15-13.

With his 16th bunt single of the season, Houston center fielder Willy Taveras
extends his hitting streak to 26 games to set an Astros record. The previous
mark was set by second baseman Jeff Kent in 2004.

2007
With his 1,150th victory as the Bronx Bombers skipper, Joe Torre passes Casey
Stengel for second place on the Yankees all time managerial win list. Joe
McCarthy compiled a franchise record winning 1,460 contests during his
16-year tenure in the dugout.

2008
A protest of parents and teammates is held demanding Jericho Scott be
allowed to continue to pitch in the Youth Baseball League of New Haven. The
nine-year-old, a right-hander with pinpoint control of a 40-mph fastball,
was banned from the mound for throwing too hard.

At Beijing's Wukesong Baseball Field, South Korea, not favored to compete
for a medal, upsets Cuba to win the gold in the Olympic final. The unbeaten
squad, which finishes with a 9-0 record, now will not have to report for
two years of military duty due to their heroics on the diamond.

2009
After a shaky defensive bottom of the ninth inning at Citi Field, in which he
makes an error and another poor play allowing a batter to reach on an infield
hit, Eric Bruntlett redeems himself when he turns the Mets' attempted double
steal into a game-ending unassisted triple play. The fourteenth single-handed
regular-season triple killing, only the second one which results in the last
three outs of a game, occurs when the Phillies' second baseman snares Jeff
Francoeur's line drive up the middle for the first out, steps on second to
double up Luis Castillo, and then tags the runner coming from first base,
Daniel Murphy, for the last out of Philadelphia's 9-7 victory.

2011
The Angels formally announce the signing of their #1 starter, 28-year-old
right-hander Jered Weaver, to a five-year contract extension reported to
be worth $85 million. The American League All-Star game starter, who was
eligible to become a free agent after the 2012 season, has compiled a 14-6
record along with a league-leading 2.10 ERA so far this season.

2013
At a Dodger Stadium press conference, LA announces Vin Scully will continue
to broadcast Dodger games for the 65th consecutive season season. Some
the historic moments the Hall of Fame broadcaster has called include Don
Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, 19 no-hitters including
four thrown by Sandy Koufax, Hank Aaron's 715th homerun, and Kirk Gibson's
dramatic walk-off in the 1988 Fall Classic.

2019
With his 30th stolen base, against the New York Mets, Ronald Acuna became
the second-youngest player to join the game's 30-30 club. The only other
player to join the 30-30 club before his 22-year-old season was Mike Trout,
who accomplished this feat during his 20-year-old season in 2012.

2020
Jose Abreu hit homeruns in four consecutive at-bats over two days to tie
the Major League record. Abreu hit homeruns in his last three at-bats
yesterday against the Chicago Cubs and then connected on his first at-bat
today. Abreu's feat was the 43rd in league history.
