and single.

1904
AL president Ban Johnson suspends Washington manager Griffith for 3 days for
'umpire baiting.'

1905
In Pittsburgh, Bill Klem narrowly escapes a beating at the hands of
gamblers. The heavily favored Pirates are down, 5-2, in the 9th inning against
Boston when a number of Pirates start mocking Klem's flamboyant calls. The
rookie umpire chases them down and fines each $10, thereby incurring the wrath
of the gamblers, who go looking for Klem. He wisely hides in the ladies' room.

Following a 5-4 loss to Brooklyn, the 6th-place St. Louis Cardinals fire
their manager Jimmy Burke and put in Matt Robison. Robison is the 3rd
manager this year for St. Louis, and he'll be replaced at the end of the
year by John McCloskey.

Mistaking her husband for a burglar, Ty Cobb's mother shoots and kills him,
an incident that will be cited as the reason for Cobb's intense desire to
succeed. The Georgia Peach will make his ML debut with the Tigers later
this month.

combining for the shutout. Lefty Leifield takes the loss.

Pittsburgh's Babe Adams scatters 11 hits in shutting out Boston, 10-0.

1911
In Chicago, the Giants paste the Cubs, 16-5, and the Pirates now lead in
the NL race for the first time. But it doesn't last, as the Cubs replace
them tomorrow with a 7-5 win over the visiting Cardinals. The lead changes
26 times, as the top 4 bounce in and out until the Giants emerge on August
24th and build a 7 1/2 game lead over the Cubs.

1913
In Cincinnati, the Giants coast to an 11-2 win over the Reds. Mathewson
leaves with a victory after 7 innings.

1915

game. Giving up the hits are George Pierce and Pete Standridge.

1916
The Philadelphia A's 20-game losing streak ends when Joe Bush beats the
Tigers, 7-1. The 20-80 club has only won three of their prior 43 contests

by owner Herrmann, but will be acquitted by NL Prexy Heydler. During the
hearings, John McGraw said that if Chase is found innocent he would hire
him for the Giants. But Prince Hal will be reinstated and play for the
Giants in 1919.

1919
Cubs P Jim "Hippo" Vaughn surprises the Giants in the 8th inning by swiping

1920
In Cleveland, the Yankees top the Indians, 6-3, to cut the Tribe's lead to
3 1/2 games. Ruth, with 41 homers, is walked 3 times and goes hitless twice.

1921
The Browns go 19 innings with the Senators before topping Washington, 8-6. It
is the longest game in the majors this year. Browns star George Sisler is 6
for 9 in the game, while Brownie Dixie Davis pitches the distance allowing 13
hits. Nats star Joe Judge bangs an AL record-tying three triples in the game,
all in the first 9 innings. Davis allows no hits over the last 9 innings.

3 doubles and a triple. Wilbur Cooper is the easy winner. The Bucs take
the second game, 7-0, behind Ray Kremer.

1925
For the only time in his career, Babe Ruth is lifted for a pinch hitter. Bobby
Veach hits for the Babe, suffering from a sore back, and flies out, and
New York loses 4-3 in 12 innings. The Yanks will waive Veach (.353), along
with P Alex Ferguson, on August 17th, and the Senators will pick him up
for pennant insurance.

1926
Cleveland's Tris Speaker belts a 3-run homer in the 4th, off Walter Johnson,
and the Indians trip the Senators, 7-5. Sherry Smith is the starter and
winner.

1927

1928
Before 15,000 fans in Philley, the Athletics top Washington, 8-3, behind
Howard Ehmke's 3-hitter. Al Simmons' 12th homer of the year, a grand slam
in the 6th, is the big blow for the A's.

The Yankees whip the Red Sox, 7-1, as lefty Fred Heimach, in his Yankee
debut, gives up just 4 Boston hits. All the scoring comes in the 6th inning.

The Pirates shoot down the Cardinals, 5-4, to cut the St. Louis lead to 4
games. Carmel Hill, with relief help from Burleigh Grimes, is the winner. For
5th place Pittsburgh, it is their 8th win in a row, and 24th in their last
31 games.

1929

Bush his 11th straight win.

John Stone, Detroit OF, doubles in 2 runs in the 6th inning against Boston
as the Tigers win, 3-0. Stone has now hit in 27 straight games, but will go
hitless in tomorrow's Sunday game at Fenway. His streak started with a triple
in the 2nd game of a July 12 doubleheader. Vic Sorrell tosses today's shutout.

The A's increase their AL lead with a second straight doubleheader sweep of
the White Sox, winning 9-2 and 3-0. Jimmie Foxx' 32nd homer, off Caraway
with two on in the 8th, gives Ed Rommel the win in the curtain call. The
second place Senators drop a pair to the Indians.

1931
A day of one-hitters. After the White Sox take the opener, 4-2, over the
Browns, Dick Coffman pitches the Browns to a 1-0 win, allowing just a
5th inning single by Johnny Kerr. Bob Wetland takes the loss. The Cubs'
Guy Bush one hits the Cardinals and also wins, 1-0.

1932

Hens in an exhibition night game in Toledo. Johnson gives up no hits in a

Penacook, New Hampshire native will score thirty runs during this period
of time.

1940
Steve Sundra posts his first win of the year for the Yankees, beating the
A's and Johnny Babich, 2-0. The Yankees, at 51-51, seem to be out of the
running for their 5th straight championship. However, they will go 37-15
the rest of the way and actually make the top for a few hours on September
11th. The Yanks will ultimately finish 3rd, losing three straight to the
Browns on September 15-16.

1942
The Chicago Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds, 10-8, in 18 innings at
Cincinnati. The Reds tie the score in the 9th, 10th and 12th innings before
the Cubs hang on. Stan Hack collects 5 hits and 3 runs for Chicago. Both
teams combine to notch 25 base on balls for the match, and the Cubs strand
23 runners, while the Reds leave 21, a ML record until 1974. Each team uses
6 pitchers, a ML record. The Reds take game 2 by a 2-1 score.

As a warm-up to the upcoming series at St. Louis with Brooklyn, the
Cardinals win their 7th straight, a 7-2 win over Pittsburgh behind rookie
Johnny Beazley.

1944
The Browns win their 9th straight game for the 2nd time this season in a
3-2 win over the Yankees in New York. They lead by 6 1/2 games. St. Louis'
other team, the Cardinals, after winning 26 in July, now leads the NL by
16 1/2 games.

1946
All games are played at night for the first time in ML history, 4 in the
AL and 4 in the NL. Attendance is close to 200,000, with the Yankees at the
top of the list with 63,040 at the Stadium. The Yanks lose to the Red Sox,
4-3, as Rudy York drills a 3-run homer in the 6th inning for Boston. Boo
Ferriss wins his 19th.

1949
Dom DiMaggio's 34-game hitting streak is on the line against Vic Raschi
and the Yankees. Hitless in his first 4 at-bats, Dom hits a sinking line
drive in the 8th that his brother Joe catches at his shoetops. Dom had
started his streak after going hitless against Raschi. The Red Sox win,
6-3, to move 5 1/2 games behind the Yankees.

1950
At Boston, Bob Chipman tosses a 4-hitter to beat the Giants, 3-2, ending
their 8-game win streak and handing them their 2nd loss in 19 games. After
3 wins, Jim Hearn loses his first game as a Giant after being acquired from
St. Louis. Bob Elliot has a pair of doubles for Boston, driving in the tying
run and scoring the winning run. Elliot shrugs off the distracting techniques
of Eddie Stanky, who stands near 2B and waves his arms as Dave Koslo delivers.

1951
With possible baseball commissioner Douglas MacArthur looking on, the Dodgers
top the Giants again, 6-5, for their 12th win in 15 games between the two
rivals. The two teams combine for a NL-record 24 walks. Campanella hits two
homers, but sustains an injury in the 9th inning when Whitey Lockman crashes
into him:  "The hardest I've ever been hit in a ball game." Campy will miss
four days but the bone chips will hamper him the rest of the season. Clyde
King gets his 2nd win in two days and shortstops Pee Wee Reese (19) and Alvin
Dark (17) keep their hitting streaks alive. The Dodgers lead by 12 1/2 games.

In the Braves' 5-4 win over the Phillies, catcher Ebba St. Claire participates
in 3 double plays to tie the ML record. The record will be topped in the AL,
but not till 1999 will another NL backstop be in 3 DPs in a game.

1952
Denver's Bill Pinkard (Western League) hits a carom homer for a 1-0 win
over Omaha. His 7th inning drive is grabbed by LF Dick Cordell who crashes
into the wall. The impact jars the ball out of his glove, and it hits the
wall and rebounds off his head over the fence. The umps rule it a HR.

1953
At Fenway, Ted Williams pinch-hits again, this time for Johnny Lipon,
and this time with different results. He clouts an 8th-inning homer off
the Indians' Mike Garcia, but the Red Sox lose, 9-3. Williams last hit a
pinch homerun in 1941.

The White Sox salvage the finale of their series, beating New York, 5-0,
behind Pierce's 3-hitter. The Sox trail New York by 7 games.

1956
Longtime Dodger announcer Connie Desmond resigns from the broadcast booth.

The Senators get a license to sell beer at Griffith Stadium and the Yankees
celebrate with a 15-7 pasting of the Nats. Mantle is walked three times
before his slices a two-run homer in the 7th.

1957
The red-hot Braves top the Cardinals, 13-2. Bob Hazle, brought up in late
July to replace the injured Bruton, goes 4 for 5 with 2 RBIs.

1958
Yankee Stadium has its biggest crowd in 7 years, 67,916 for Old Timers'
Day, but they are disappointed as Boston takes a 7-0 lead and holds on for
a 9-6 win.

Behind Harry Bright's 1st ML HR, the Pirates beat the Reds, 5-2. Curt Raydon
wins his 6th buts gives up 2 runs in the 5th, breaking the Pirate pitchers'
scoreless streak at Forbes of 45 2/3 innings.

1959
The Pirates, down 3-1 to the Cubs in the 9th, tie the game, then win 5-3 in
the 10th. Elroy Face wins in relief to go 15-0. The win is the 11th extra
inning victory in a row for the Pirates ... the only loss in their last 16
extra-inning games was Haddix' 12-inning perfect game against the Braves
in May.

1960
With the fine relief pitching of Lindy McDaniel in the opener and a
5-hitter by Curt Simmons in the nitecap, the Cards sweep the Phils, 5-4
and 6-0. Phillie Tony Taylor ties a ML record for 2B by going the entire
doubleheader (18 innings) without a putout, the first to achieve the feat
since Connie Ryan of the Phillies, June 14, 1953.

Ted Williams blasts his 19th HR and 511th of his career, off Perry, but the
Red Sox lose to the Indians, 6-3. Ted's 5th-inning HR ties him with Mel
Ott for 3rd on the all-time list. Francona and Power homer for the Tribe
to back Perry (14-5). Power's hit ricochets off the top of the RF fence in
Cleveland toward Lou Clinton. The ball hits Clinton's foot and is "kicked"
over the fence. Umpire Hal Smith rules the hit a HR, since the ball never
touched the ground.

1961
The Reds continue their domination of the hapless Phillies by winning its
16th straight game against the squad, who have won just one contest in
their last 19 tries. Joey Jay's 5-0 whitewash is the 13th loss in a row
for Philadelphia, the club's longest losing streak in 25 years. Elio Chacon
hits his first ML homer, off Don Ferrarese.

The Cards beat the Pirates, 4-0, with all the Birds' scoring coming on a
grand slam by Julian Javier.

The Dodgers win their 17th out of 20 to stay a game ahead of the Reds,
beating the Braves, 8-3. Don Drysdale hits a grand slam, off Don Nottebart
in the 2nd, and allows just 4 hits while striking out 11. Two of the 4 hits
are homers by Joe Adcock.

1963
One loss shy of tying the major league record of 19 consecutive defeats,
Roger Craig switches his uniform number to 13 in an attempt to change his
luck. The move appears to work when pinch-hitter Jim Hickman lofts a short fly
ball off Lindy McDaniel in the ninth inning with two outs and the bases-full
in a tie game that just ticks the upper-deck overhang in left field at the
Polo Grounds for a walk-off grand slam, giving the Mets an improbable 7-3
victory over the Cubs. McDaniel becomes the second pitcher in major league
history to give up a pair of game-ending grand slams in the same season. The
Chicago right-hander, who also allowed Houston's Bob Aspromonte to end a
game with a bases-full walk-off round-tripper in June, joins Satchel Paige
(1952) in accomplishing the infamous deed. Craig will be on the wrong end
of a shutout 9 times this year. Only Bugs Raymond (11 in 1908) and Walter
Johnson (10 in 1909) have had more shutouts thrown at them in a year.

The longest game in 12 years, again at Forbes Field, takes place between
the Colt 45's and the Pirates. Rain delays the start of the two games by
an hour, then Houston outlasts the Bucs, 7-6, in 15 innings. The 2nd game
is another struggle, this time the Pirates winning, 7-6, in 11 innings,
on a bases loaded single by Clemente. Only 300 fans are on hand when the
curtain comes down at 2:30 a.m.

1964
Phillies P Jim Bunning, who pitched a no-hitter in his last start against
the Mets, throws another 5 innings of hitless ball against New York before
Joe Christopher beats out a 2-out bunt. Bunning wins the game, 6-0.

1966
The Braves fire Bobby Bragan (52-59) and install coach Billy Hitchcock as
their new manager. 52,270 watch in Atlanta as Felipe Alou hits a leadoff HR
off Sandy Koufax. The Dodgers tie it, but Eddie Mathews adds a 9th-inning
solo HR to beat the Dodgers' ace, 2-1. Alou will lead off tomorrow's game
with a HR as well.

1967
Minnesota's 20-inning 9-7 loss to the Senators is the longest game in Twins
history. Ken McMullen's 20th-inning HR wins it for Washington.

In a definition of manager's hell, the Carolina League (Class A) Burlington
team plays a 7-inning game against Raleigh and Burlington batters hit into
a double play in each inning.

1968
California pitchers plunk Baltimore batters 3 times in the 7th inning at
Memorial Stadium, tying the AL record for hit batsmen in one inning. Baltimore
wins, 3-0.

give up 4 runs in the 9th as the Giants lose, 7-4, to the Cards.

1970
At Three Rivers Stadium, Willie Stargell hits an 8th-inning homer into
the 70-foot high right field upper deck, the first player to hit one up
there. The pitch is served up by Mets reliever Ron Taylor. The next two
hit up there will be by Stargell, who will hit four of the first 7 ... Bob
Robertson, Phillie Greg Luzinski and Bobby Bonilla, in 1987, will also
reach the seats. The Pirates win, 8-3. Nolan Ryan is the loser, allowing
4 runs in 6 innings, giving up 3 hits, walking 7 and striking out 10.

1971
The Indians score 8 runs in the 5th inning to beat the Cubs, 13-5, in the
annual Hall of Fame game. Earlier, the Hall had inducted Satchel Paige and
the 7 others selected in January.

Despite belting 6 homeruns - 3 by Bill Freehan, 2 by Horton, one by Rodriguez
- at Fenway Park, the Tigers lose to the Red Sox, 12-11. The Sox have only
one homer, a grand slam by Bob Montgomery. Rico Petrocelli's pinch single
with 2 outs in the 9th drives home the winner.

1975
At Shea Stadium, Davey Lopes steals his 32nd consecutive base without being
caught breaking Max Carey's 1922 record in the Dodgers' 2-0 victory over
New York. The Dodger second baseman's mark will be broken by Vince Coleman
in 1989.

1976
Cal Hubbard, with his induction into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown as an
umpire, becomes the first professional athlete to be elected into two Hall
of Fames. In 1963, the Missouri native was enshrined into the pro football
Hall of Fame as a result of his outstanding performance on the gridiron with
the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers. In the Hall of Fame game following
the inductions of Roberts, Lemon and others, the Brewers beat the Mets, 9-3.

John Candelaria becomes the first Pirate since 1907 to throw a no-hitter in
Pittsburgh. Twenty-two-year-old pitcher survives a bases-loaded situation in
the 3rd inning to beat the Dodgers, 2-0. Nick Maddox threw the first and only
Buc home no-hitter until the "Candyman's" gem at Three Rivers Stadium. (There
was never a no-hitter pitched in the 61-year history of spacious Forbes
Field.) Candelaria improves his record to 11-4 for the 2nd-place Pirates.

In Houston's 13-4 win over the Cardinals, Cesar Cedeno hits for the cycle.

1977
The White Sox hit 6 HRs against the Mariners to tie the club mark at Comiskey
Park. Eric Soderholm has 2, with Chet Lemon, Oscar Gamble, Jim Essian and
Royle Stillman contributing.

Reds pitchers Doug Capilla and Pedro Borbon combine on a one-hitter,
stopping the Dodgers, 4-0. The only LA hit is Ron Cey's infield single to
SS with 2 outs in the 7th. Cey is called safe on a close and disputed play
at 1B. Capilla is lifted with 2 on in the 8th.

1979
Longtime Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley dies at age 75.

1981
Major league baseball returns in a big way from its in-season strike as
72,086 fans attend the belated All-Star game in Cleveland. Vida Blue becomes
the first pitcher to win an All-Star game for both leagues. Expos C Gary
Carter hits a pair of solo homeruns and Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt adds a
2-run shot in the 8th off Rollie Fingers to give the NL a 5-4 win. It is
the NL's 10th win in a row and 17th in the last 18 games.

1987
With help from Lee Smith, Scott Sanderson beats the Mets, 6-3, at Shea
Stadium. The loser is Doc Gooden who snaps his 10-game winning streak
against the Cubs. He'll start another streak of 12 wins.

In a 15-4 Tiger mauling of the Yankees, New York catcher Rick Cerone takes
the mound. Again, he walks one batter and allows no runs, the second time
in 3 weeks he's caught and pitched in the same game.

1988
The Cubs and Mets play the first official night game at Wrigley Field, a
6-4 Chicago victory. New York's Lenny Dykstra hits the first night homerun,
supplanting Phil Bradley, whose leadoff homerun last night was washed
out. Reliever Frank DiPino is the winner over Mets starter Sid Fernandez.

1990
San Diego SS Garry Templeton collects his 2,000th ML hit exactly 14 years
after getting his first. The Padres beat the Braves, 7-0, with Bruce Hurst
winning over Charlie Leibrandt.

The Yankees beat Brad Radke and the Twins, 4-1, stopping Radke's 12-game
winning streak. Luis Sojo snaps a 1-1 tie in the 8th with a 2-run HR. Since
1950, only 3 pitchers have won 12 straight games.

1992
Yankees rookie P Sam Militello allows just 1 hit in 7 innings as he defeats
the Red Sox, 6-0, in his major league debut.

1995
The Giants defeat the Pirates, 4-3. The winning pitcher is William
VanLandingham and the loser, Jason Christiansen. The 25 letters in the
surnames of the 2 pitchers of record is the most ever in a major league game.

George Nicolau, baseball's impartial arbitrator since 1986, is fired by
major league owners.

1996
In a 4-3 10-inning loss to the White Sox, Cal Ripken records his 2,500th
career hit, a single off White Sox Bill Simas.

Fernando Valenzuela limits Pittsburgh to 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings and Greg
Vaughn hits the 100-RBI mark with a solo homer to lead the Padres to a 4-1

RBIs. Trammell homers in the 9th inning to tie the game and again in the
13th inning to win it.

1998

parade of the dogs and their owners on the field.

In Boston's 14-8 victory over the Rangers, Dennis Eckersley ties Kent Tekulve
for second on the all-time list with 1,050 appearances by a pitcher. Hoyt
Wilhelm is the over-all leader with 1,070.

Atlanta's Dennis Martinez pitches a perfect eighth inning and gets the win
over the Giants, 7-5, for his 244th career victory to set the record for
most wins by a Latin American pitcher. Juan Marichal held the old mark. 3B
Chipper Jones backs Martinez pitching with 4 hits and 4 ribbies.

1999
The Blue Jays defeat the Rangers in Texas, 19-4, setting a team record by
recording 25 hits. The total, which includes six doubles and four homeruns,
establishes a new franchise mark for hits. OF Jacob Brumfeld and 2B Homer
Bush get 4 hits apiece for Toronto while 4 other players record 3 safeties
each. P Doug Davis enters the game in the 6th inning for Texas, making his
major league debut. In 2 1/3 innings of work, he allows 11 hits, including
3 HRs, while surrendering 10 earned runs. He'll return to the minors tomorrow.

A total of 5 grand slams are hit on the day, marking the first time it has

an injunction from the National Labor Relations Board to stop Major League
Baseball from firing 22 umpires on September 2.

The Blue Jays obtain OF Brian McRae from the Rockies for a player to be named.

2001
The Rockies defeated the Cubs, 14-5, despite 3 successive HRs by Sammy
Sosa. Winning pitcher Mike Hampton ties the NL record for HRs in a season
by a pitcher by hitting his 7th. The ML record is 9.

The Giants score a 6-4 victory over the Reds in a game marked by 2 milestone
HRs. Ken Griffey Jr hits the 450th of his career, becoming the youngest player
(by 15 days, over Jimmie Foxx) in history to reach that mark. He was also
the youngest to hit 350 and 400. Barry Bonds hits his 49th of the season,
becoming the fastest to ever reach that number.

On the hottest August 9th (103 degrees temperature) in NY history, the Mets
edge the Brewers, 4-3. Joe McEwing's HR off reliever DeJean gives the win
to Al Leiter.

Yankees P Ted Lilly is suspended for 6 games for hitting Anaheim's Scott
Speizio in the head with a pitch in a game last Sunday. NY manager Joe Torre

was not thrown out of the game by the umpires when the incident occurred.

2002
Barry Bonds joins Babe Ruth, Willie Mays (Bonds' godfather) and Hank Aaron
as the only players ever to hit 600 career homeruns. The 38-year-old Giant
left fielder hit the milestone homer in the sixth inning by lining a 2-1
pitch thrown by Pirates starter Kip Wells over the center field wall at
Pacific Bell Park. The Giants fall to the Pirates by a score of 4-3.

At the age of 26 years and 182 days, Vladimir Guerrero hits his 200th
career homerun tying the Expos' right fielder with Ken Griffey Jr as the
second-youngest player to reach the 200 homer plateau. Alex Rodriguez is
the youngest major leaguer to reach the 200 homer mark doing it in 25 years
290 days. The Expos trounce the Brewers, 11-4.

The Reds defeat the Padres, 12-10, as Cincinnati 3B Aaron Boone hits 3
HRs. Two of the blasts come in Cincinnati's 9-run 1st inning. Brother Brett
Boone has also homered twice in one inning.

Erubial Durazo accounts for all of Arizona's runs with a pair of homers
in the D'back's 2-1 win over Florida. His 2nd homer, off Braden Looper,
snaps a 1-1 tie in the 9th.

2003
The Red Sox defeat the Orioles, 6-4, as Kevin Millar hits a 2-run HR in
the 8th inning. Millar's blast is the 10,000th in Fenway Park history.

The Indians sweep a doubleheader from the Angels by identical scores of
3-2. In the 2nd contest, Cleveland's P Jason Boyd turns an unassisted DP.

2005
An arbitrator rules Kenny Rogers, who has missed 13 games, should be
reinstated. The decision states the punishment for shoving two cameramen
handed down by Bud Selig went too far in suspending the Ranger pitcher for
20 games and levying an excessive $50,000 fine.

The Indians score 11 runs in the 9th inning to come from behind and record
a 13-7 win over the Royals. The loss is KC's 11th in a row.

2006
Former hometown hero Mike Piazza belts two homeruns off Mets ace Pedro
Martinez and nearly hits a third one in the eighth inning during a 4-3 Padres
loss in New York. The Big Apple fans give their ex-catcher an uncommon road
curtain call after the round tripper, but aren't so kind the second time
the backstop goes deep as he is greeted with boos and catcalls.

Mark DeRosa makes two outs in one at-bat ending the A's/Rangers contest in
a most unlikely manner. On a 3-2 pitch, the right fielder swings and misses
making the second out of the inning, but when his momentum causes him to
make contact with Oakland catcher Jason Kendall, who is throwing to second
trying to prevent pinch-runner Jerry Hairston Jr from stealing a base,
plate umpire Jim Joyce calls interference on the batter for the third and
final out of the game.

2008
As part of the 50th anniversary celebration commemorating the Giants'
move to San Francisco, the team honors its greatest outfielders. Barry
Bonds, speculated by most not to be in attendance for the event, receives a
standing ovation accompanied by loud approval from the surprised fans when the
slugger's name is announced and takes part in the ceremony telling the crowd,
"It feels awful to me not to be in uniform and the Dodgers are right here".

Micah Hoffpauir ties a modern Pacific Coast League record by homering in
his first four at-bats in the Iowa Cubs' 15-3 rout over the Round Rock
Express. The 28-year-old slugging first baseman becomes the third player
in the history of the storied PCL to go deep in four consecutive at-bats
and the fifth to accomplish the feat in one game.

2010
Citing he has lost confidence in his manager, Mariner GM Jack Zduriencik
fires Don Wakamatsu and three coaches. Triple-A Tacoma manager Daren Brown
is named as the interim pilot of the last-place club (42-70), becoming the
team's fifth skipper in a little more than three years.

The front-running Reds obtain 40-year-old veteran Jim Edmonds from the
Brewers in exchange for Chris Dickerson, a light-hitting defensively
talented outfielder. Dusty Baker will use his newest player, who hit .286
and eight homers in 73 games for Milwaukee, in a part-time role during the
playoff chase.

2013
Dan Haren becomes the thirteenth pitcher in history to record a victory over
all 30 major league franchises when he hurls seven solid innings in the
Nationals' 9-2 win over Philadelphia. The 32-year-old right-hander joins
Al Leiter, Randy Johnson, Barry Zito, A.J. Burnett, Kevin Brown, Terry
Mulholland, Curt Schilling, Woody Williams, Jamie Moyer, Javier Vazquez,
Vicente Padilla and Derek Lowe in accomplishing the feat.

The Dodgers rally for four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, overcoming
a six-run seventh-inning deficit, for their fifth walk-off victory of the
season. The team's 7-6 victory over Tampa Bay is their 11th consecutive
win in one-run games, a span in which they have defeated ten different clubs.

2015
The New York Yankees Major League record of 2,665 consecutive games played
without having been held scoreless, in back-to-back contests, was snapped
when Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marco Estrada tossed a 2-0 shutout win at
Yankee Stadium. Left-handed pitcher David Price blanked New York, 6-0,
on the previous day.
