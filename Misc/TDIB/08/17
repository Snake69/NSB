remains as a player.

Walter Johnson gives up 4 hits in topping the A's Chief Bender in 12

give up 27 hits.

Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman dies as a result of being hit by a pitch
thrown by Yankee submariner Carl Mays. The tragedy remains the only on-field
fatality in major league history. In memory of Ray Chapman, the Yankees
postpone today's game with the Indians. At a meeting between the Red Sox
and Tigers in Boston, the players threaten to boycott playing against Carl
Mays. Tiger SS Donie Bush announces to the press that he is willing to leave
the Tigers and play SS for Cleveland in Chapman's place. In Washington, the
Browns unanimously agree that Mays "must be removed from baseball," though
they don't accuse Mays of deliberately throwing at Chapman. The Senators
are less strident. Ban Johnson receives a telegram informing him of the
threatened boycotts around the AL. Mays charges that if there is any blame
it should go to umpire Tommy Connolly because he allowed a ball with a rough
spot to be kept in play. From Boston, umpires Billy Evans and Will Dinneen
blast Mays stating "no pitcher in the American League resorted to trickery
more than Carl Mays in attempting to rough a ball to get a break on it ...".

and cracks a 3-run homer off Lefty Gomez to win the game, 7-6.

Earl Averill hits for the cycle, as the Indians beat the A's, 15-4. Playing

1934

MA last month, draws only 85 paying customers to a doubleheader. The team's

to evict the New England League franchise from Alumni Field, making it
necessary for the club to finish the season on the road.

1948
An estimated crowd of 100,000 fans pass by the body of Babe Ruth which is on

AL record by hitting 4 batters with pitches in the contest. Previously,
he had hit only 2 in 154 innings.

2001
The Brewers defeat the Reds, 5-1. Cincinnati P Jose Rijo hurls the last 2
scoreless innings in relief, his first major league action in 6 years.

Mike Mussina throws 7 shutout innings and the Yankees club 3 homers to
beat the Mariners, 4-0. Derek Jeter hits a leadoff HR and will do it again
tomorrow.

Toronto beats Texas, 11-3, as Jeff Frye becomes the 2nd Blue Jay ever
to hit for the cycle. Frye's final hit of the evening is a liner to deep
right-center that, in other circumstances, might have gone for a double. But
with his team safely in the lead, Frye stops at first to record a single
and give himself a cycle. After the game, Frye finds a bicycle leaning
against his locker, the traditional reward for the feat. Kelly Gruber is
the only other Toronto player to accomplish the feat, and he makes it to
the SkyDome in time to give an on-field hug after Frye's fourth at-bat.

Atlanta's Greg Maddux pitches the Braves to a 2-1 win over the Giants and
Livan Hernandez. Hernandez came into the game with 8 straight hits and in
his 1st at-bat reaches on an error. He goes 1 for 3. John Smoltz racks up
his first regular season save, striking out 4 batters.

2002
Alex Rodriguez becomes the sixth player and the first infielder to compile
five consecutive 40-homerun seasons. The Rangers' shortstop joins Ralph Kiner
(1947-51), Duke Snider (1953-57), Ken Griffey Jr (1996-2000), Sammy Sosa
(1998-2002) and Babe Ruth (1926-32), who established the record with seven
straight 40-homer seasons. The Rangers pound the Blue Jays today, 9-5.

The Yankees defeat the Mariners, 8-3, as Alfonso Soriano homers (in the
seventh inning off Mariner stater James Baldwin) to become the first 2B ever
to hit 30 HRs and steal 30 bases in a season. Bobby Bonds is the only other
Yankee to post a 30/30 season accomplishing the feat in 1975. NY OF Bernie
Williams singles in his 1st at-bat to give him 11 consecutive hits. He makes
an out his next time up to fall 1 short of the ML record. His 5 for 5 and
4 for 4 in back-to-back games, the first in 45 years, won't be duplicated
until the Pirates' Jayson Werth matches him in 2007.

The Padres down the Expos, 6-5. In doing so, they set a new ML record for
pitchers used in a season.

Houston scores 5 runs in the 9th inning to beat Cincinnati, 6-1. SS Jose
Vizcaino gets 5 hits, including a leadoff HR.

2003
Good grief. Peanuts character Charlie Brown joins late broadcaster Bob
Prince, Negro League star Josh Gibson, former catcher Manny Sanguillen,
and current shortstop Jack Wilson to be honored by the Pirates with a
bobblehead doll give-away day. Almost ten percent of the nearly 18,000
Peanuts strips created by Charles Schulz focused on baseball.

The Rally Monkey, the Angels' unofficial mascot, is honored for its
contribution to last season's world championship with it's own bobble head
doll promotion. The Rally Monkey Bobble Belly joins other dolls given
to fans this year paying tribute to Troy Glaus (2002 World Series MVP),
Adam Kennedy (ALCS MVP) and Mike Scioscia (AL manager of the year), and
will wear an Anaheim jersey with a name of a honored player on the back.
The Angels down the Tigers, 11-6, as Garret Anderson becomes the Angels'
career hits leader. His 3 hits move him ahead of Brian Downing's club mark.

Up 2-0 in the 9th, San Francisco Giants starter Sidney Ponson exits with
the bases loaded and one out. Todd Worrell strikes out the next batter
but then serves up a walkoff grand slam to Montreal Expos outfielder Brad
Wilkerson. The Expos win, 4-2.

2004
As she enters Raley Field at 6:27 p.m., five-year-old Olivia Perez is
honored by the River Cats as she becomes the four millionth fan in franchise
history. The Triple A affiliate of the Oakland A's reaches the milestone
faster than any club in minor league baseball history.

The Rangers crush the Indians, 16-4, as Mark Texeira becomes the 2nd player
in Texas history to hit for the cycle. Texeira drives in 7 runs with a
2-run double in the 3rd, a 3-run HR in the 4th, a 2-run triple in the 5th,
and a leadoff single in the 7th. Oddibe McDowell is the only other Ranger
to accomplish the feat, doing so on July 23, 1985.

The Mariners crush the Royals, 16-3, as Raul Ibanez strokes a career-high 5
hits and scores 4 runs. Ichiro Suzuki has 4 hits and 5 RBIs and hits a leadoff
HR for the 2nd straight game. Bret Boone chips in with a pair of homers.

Jason Jennings goes 7 innings and is credited with the win in the Rockies'
6-4 victory over the visiting Mets. Matt Holliday has a homer and scores
3 runs. New York loses recently acquired pitcher Victor Zambrano for the
season when he runs off the mound after walking a batter in the 3rd. They
will lose him exactly the same way in May of 2006.

The Devil Rays down the Angels, 8-3, as Tampa Bay SS BJ Upton becomes the
1st teenager in more than 6 years to homer in a ML game. The last to do so
was Aramis Ramirez on June 16, 1998.

2005
St. Louis announces the franchise has broken its single-season attendance
record of 3.43 million set in 1989. The first-place Cardinals have sold
3.45 million tickets for the team's farewell season at 40-year-old Busch
Stadium. The Cardinals become the 1st team to clinch a spot in the playoffs
by beating the Cubs, 5-1. It is their 4th division title in the past 6 years.

The Astros shut out the Brewers, 7-0. Craig Biggio hits his NL-career-record
43rd leadoff HR for Houston.

The Phillies score 10 runs in the 9th inning to send the Marlins to a shocking
10-2 defeat. The Phils are just the 3rd team to have been shut out going
into the 9th and then scoring 10 runs, joining the 1912 Reds (vs. Cubs,
who trailed 9-0, scored 10 in the top of the 9th and lost when they gave
up 2 in the bottom of the inning) and the 1962 White Sox (vs. Indians,
trailed 2-0, won 10-2). Phillies 3B David Bell has 3 hits.

Cuba downs South Korea, 3-0, to win its 8th straight baseball World Cup,
and its 24th since the competition began in 1938.

2006
The White Sox edge the Royals, 5-4. For the 1st time in ML history, both
teams hit leadoff HRs in each of the first 2 innings. David DeJesus hits
the first pitch of the game for a homer. In the bottom of the 1st, Pablo
Ozuna leads off with a homer for Chicago. Emil Brown homers for KC to start
the 2nd inning, and Jermaine Dye homers to open the bottom of the 2nd.

The Toronto Blue Jays trade 3B-OF Eric Hinske to the Red Sox for a player
to be named later.

2008
During the fifth inning of an 11-8 loss to the Twins at the Metrodome,
Mariners right-hander R. A. Dickey throws four wild pitches tying a major
league record for WPs in one frame. Seattle backstop Kenji Johjima is also
charged with a passed ball on another pitch thrown in the infamous inning.

The Blue Jays set a team record for two-baggers slugging 10 doubles in a
15-4 victory over the Red Sox at Fenway Park. With his 5 for 6 performance,
Alex Rios ties a club mark becoming the third player in franchise history
to hit four doubles in one game.

In a pre-game 55-minute ceremony at Minute Maid Park, Craig Biggio becomes
the ninth Astro to have his jersey number retired. The Smithtown, N.Y. native,
who wore number 7, is the team's all-time leader in games (2,850) and seasons
(20) played.

Josh Hamilton becomes only the sixth major leaguer to be intentionally walked
with the bases loaded. Rays manager Joe Maddon's decision to give the Rangers'
slugger a run-producing free pass in the ninth inning is successful when
Tampa Bay goes on to win the game in Arlington, 7-4.

2012
Lugazi, Uganda becomes the first team from Africa to appear in the 66-year
history of the Little League World Series when they are defeated by Aguadulce,
Panama, 9-3. None of the African youths, who have become the darlings of
the tournament, have been playing baseball for more than two years.

Clay Buchholz strikes out Adam Jones (looking), Matt Wieters (looking) and
Chris Davis (swinging) on nine pitches in the bottom of the sixth inning
of the Red Sox' 6-3 victory over Baltimore at Camden Yards. The immaculate
inning thrown by the Red Sox right-hander marks the 47th time the feat has
been accomplished in major league history, and the first for a Boston hurler
since Pedro Martinez turned the trick in 2002.

In his 1,000th major league game, Prince Fielder, with his two homers off
Josh Becket in the Tigers' 10-0 rout of Boston at Comerica Park, ends the
day with 232 career round-trippers. The Detroit first baseman's dad, Cecil,
also had the same total of big league homeruns after playing in the same
amount of games.

2013
Miguel Tejada is suspended for 105 games, one of the longest in baseball
history, after he reportedly tested positive on multiple occasions
this season for Adderall, an amphetamine used to treat attention-deficit
disorder. The 39-year-old Royals infielder, a six-time All-Star, apologizes
to the organization, his teammates and the Kansas City fans explaining his
medical condition requires medication, but that he was wrong to take it
while re-applying for a Therapeutic Use Exemption.

Clayton Kershaw blanks the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, 5-0, giving the
Dodgers their first double-digit winning streak since 2006. The team's
42 victories in their last fifty games, including a 25-3 mark since the
All-Star break, equals the 1941 Yankees and 1942 Cardinals for the best
record for that span of games since 1900.

2014
Michael Cuddyer is the 30th player to hit for multiple cycles, but becomes
only the third player to accomplish the feat in both the American and
National League, joining Bob Watson (Astros, 1977, and Red Sox, 1979) and
John Olerud (Mets, 1997, and Mariners, 2001). The rare baseball occurrence
is completed with an eighth inning double off Reds reliever Manny Parra,
who yielded three of the hits in the outfielder's first cycle in 2009,
pitching for the Brewers in a game against the Twins.

2020
Luis Garcia cecame the first Major League player born in the 2000s to hit
a homerun. He accomplished this feat against the Atlanta Braves.
