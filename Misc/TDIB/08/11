it up.

doubleheader beating the Boston Braves, 4-0. The contest was shortened by
a prior agreement between the clubs. The Cardinals also win game 1, 5-4.

Just enough to win. The first place Cubs beat the visiting Phillies twice
by scores of 1-0. Orval Overall and Jack Pfiester apply the calcimine.

1908
The Cards fall to Boston, 2-0, as Boston pitcher Tom Tuckey gets his only
shutout in his first major league game.

1909
John McGraw puts 49-year-old coach Arlie Latham at 2B in a 19-3 romp over

5 runs.

1910
The White Sox trade P Frank Smith, whose best days are behind him, and 3B
Billy Purtell to the Red Sox in exchange for 2B Amby McConnell and 3B Harry
Lord. On July 10th, a Walter Johnson fastball broke Lord's finger, and the
stellar play of his substitute Clyde Engel has made Lord expendable. Lord
becoming the one threat in the weak White Sox lineup, hitting .297 through
the end of the year, but the Sox will still finish last in hitting, slugging
and homers.

At New York, the Giants take two from Cincinnati, 5-4 and 3-2. Mathewson wins
the opener, despite allowing 11 hits and 4 walks. Matty is tough in the pinch,
however, as the Reds load the bases in the 9th with no outs but fail to score.

1911
The Phillies reach Christy Mathewson for 11 hits, but fail to score as
New York triumphs, 6-0. The Giants toast Bill Burns for 4 runs in the 1st
two innings.

1914
Boston Braves P Lefty Tyler begins a string of 23 shutout innings, but Red
Ames of the Reds matches him today in a 13-inning 0-0 tie. Four days later,
Tyler will beat Christy Mathewson, 2-0, in 10 innings.

In St. Louis, the Giants are trailing the Cardinals, 3-2, after 5 innings
when the light rain turns heavy. The umps call the game, a loss to New
York's Mathewson.

After missing 6 weeks, first with broken ribs, then a broken thumb, Ty Cobb
signs a new 3-year contract and returns to the lineup. He and Sam Crawford
had been offered double their salaries to jump to the Feds. Cobb will get
into just 97 games, but he will win another batting crown at .368. Under
existing rules his 345 at-bats are enough to qualify.

At Brooklyn, the Cubs lose, 3-2. Chicago teammates Roger Bresnahan and
Heinie Zimmerman are ejected for fighting with each other.

White Sox pitchers Mellie Wolfgang and Ed Cicotte both toss 2-0 shutouts
against Cleveland.

1923
The Tigers beat the Yanks, 10-4, in a series that features the top 2 AL
hitters. Babe Ruth goes 3 for 8 against the Tigers, while Harry Heilmann
is 5 for 10 against the Yanks. The two are neck and neck at .390 for the
year. After the game, AL President Ban Johnson rules that Babe Ruth must give
up his Sam Crawford bat, made for him by the future Hall of Famer. The bat
is "four pieces of seasoned wood, carefully glued together." On August 21,
Johnson rules that only one-piece bats will be allowed, a rule that also
affects Ken Williams, who is using a plugged bat.

1926
In a 7-2 loss to the White Sox, Tris Speaker hits his 700th career double,
off Joe Edwards. The Indian outfielder will establish a major league record
with 792 two-baggers.

Dodgers rookie Babe Herman collects his 8th and 9th hits in a row, but flies
out to Kiki Cuyler in the 6th to fall short of the record of 10 straight,
held by Cuyler and Ed Konetchy. Brooklyn tops the Pirates, 4-2.

At Philadelphia, the Reds kick the Phils, 21-3, as Wally Pipp contributes
a grand slam in the 3rd off Clarence Mitchell. The Reds score 5 in the 3rd,
8 in the 4th, 2 in the 5th and complete the scoring with 6 in the 7th.

1927
At St. Louis, Pete Alexander allows just 4 hits, including Lloyd Waner's
first ML homer, to beat the Pirates, 2-1. Jim Bottomley's 2-run homer in
the 7th wins it. Bottomley will repeat tomorrow in the 11th as St. Louis
cards another 2-1 win over Pittsburgh to tie for 2nd in the NL.

Cochrane's hit in the 9th gives the win to George Earnshaw. The A's stay
4 1/2 in back of the Yankees.

In Chicago, the Browns beat the White Sox, 4-2, behind Sammy Gray's 18th
victory. Gray leaves after 7 innings with the score, 2-2, but the Browns
score in the 8th and 9th and Gray is awarded the win.

1929
Babe Ruth hits HR No. 500 and his 30th of the year, in the 2nd inning
off Willis Hudlin of Cleveland on Widlin's first pitch, but the Yankees
lose, 6-5. Ruth has gone deep 6 times in his last 7 games. The homer today
lands on Lexington Avenue and is recovered by Mr. Jake Geiser who returns
it to Ruth. The Babe gives him $20 and 2 new autographed balls for it.
The Bambino has more than twice the number of round-trippers as Phillies
Cy Williams who is #2 on the all-time list with 237.

A 3-run homer by Bubbles Hargrave and another run on a throwing error by

wins the game for Boston, 3-2. With Detroit shutting out Cleveland, New
York falls 4 games behind.

Smith allows just one hit in the 5 innings he pitches to defeat reliever
Bob Smith. The latter gives up a three-run homer to Travis Jackson in the
7th. New York now leads the NL by five games.

1935
Wally Berger hits a HR, 2 doubles and a triple to tie the modern ML record for
extra-base hits in a game, but his Braves lose to the Dodgers, 7-5. Berger
drives in all of Boston's runs and his homer, his 25th of the year, puts
him one ahead of Ott in the homerun race.

1941
At Sportsman's Park, a first in Cubs history occurs in the 5th inning when
Phil Cavarretta, Stan Hack and Bill Nicholson hit consecutive homers. It's
not enough as the Cards win 7-5, but it's a costly victory as they lose Enos
Slaughter for the season. Chasing a line drive, Enos tries to avoid colliding
with teammate Terry Moore and he hits the RF wall breaking his collarbone.

Pitcher Kirby Higbe leads the Dodger charge against the Giants, as he
collects three singles and a double, good for 4 RBIs. Brooklyn wins, 15-7.

1942
At Cleveland, in the first game of a twi-nighter, Indian P Al Milnar has a
no-hitter until Doc Cramer singles with 2 out in the 9th. But the duel with

hits and his catcher Gene Desautels catches the entire game without a putout
(no strikeouts) or assist.

St. Louis P Steve Sundra stops the Yankees on just one hit, a homerun by
King Kong Keller. The Browns win, 9-1.

starter Logan is lifted.

1946
Sweeping a doubleheader, the Phillies end the Dodgers' 18-game winning
streak in Philadelphia, a major league record. The Dodgers hadn't lost in
the City of Brotherly Love since May 5, 1945.

Stan Musial gets 8 hits in 9 at-bats, as the St. Louis Cardinals sweep the
Cincinnati Reds, 15-4 and 7-3. The Reds lose the opener despite Grady Hatton,
Max West and Ray Mueller banging consecutive homers in the 8th inning,
a first in Reds history.

1947
Cardinal farmhand Harvey Haddix, pitching for Winston-Salem (Carolina)
no-hits Danville, 8-0, in 7 innings. The young Kitten strikes out 14.

1948
At Brooklyn, Chicago's Johnny Schmitz goes 11 innings to beat the Dodgers,
4-2. Schmitz scores the winning run, coming home on an Eddie Waitkus double.

1950
Boston P Vern Bickford no-hits the Dodgers in Boston before 29,008
fans. Bickford has lost only once to Brooklyn since joining Boston in
1948. The win puts Boston just 5 games behind the first-place Phillies.

Hitting just .279, Yankee great Joe DiMaggio is benched for the first time in
his career. He is currently languishing in a 4 for 38 slump. His sub, Cliff
Mapes, wallops a 7th-inning HR to give the Yankees a 7-6 win over the A's.

RF Ken Wood of the Browns nails 2 Tiger runners in the 8th inning of the
2nd game of a DH, tying a ML mark. The Browns prevail, 2-1, after winning
game 1, 4-3, in 10 innings. The split keeps the Tigers 3 games ahead of
Cleveland and 3 1/2 ahead of New York.

1951
WCBS-TV televises the first baseball game broadcast in color, a Braves
8-1 victory over the hometown Dodgers in the first game of a twin bill at
Ebbets Field. Ralph Branca gets the win. Brooklyn's announcers Red Barber
and Connie Desmond provide the play-by-play commentary. Brooklyn now leads
the NL by 13 1/2 games with 49 games to play. The Braves take the nitecap,
8-4, behind Max Surkont and a homerun by Sid Gordon.

In Philadelphia, the Giants lose to the Phils as Robin Roberts shuts them
out, 4-0, for his 16th win. Putsy Cabellero hits his 1st major league homer,
off George Spencer, for the 3rd place Phils (57-52), now just 1 1/2 games
behind New York.

Behind the four-hit pitching of Early Wynn, the Indians defeat the White Sox,
2-1, in front of a Ladies Night crowd of 70,119. Wynn's homer in the 7th
gives the Tribe (68-39) the win. Eddie Robinson and Al Rosen hit homers in
the 2nd inning. It's the Tribe's 9th straight win to stay deadlocked with
the Yankees for first place. Loser Joe Dobson, who has beaten Wynn twice
this year, gives up just 6 hits.

Eddie Joost homers in the 9th for the A's, who tie the Yanks 4-4, but the
Yanks win in 11, 7-4. Sloppy fielding and a two-run single by Berra account
for the scoring. The win goes to reliever Bob Kuzava, late of the Senators,
while Alex Kellner takes the loss.

1952
At Yankee Stadium, the 3rd place Red Sox, trailing first-place New York
by 4 games, manage just 2 hits off Allie Reynolds, as the Chief wins,
7-0. For Reynolds, it's his 4th two-hitter of the year. Mickey Mantle's
first inning homer, off Sid Hudson, is all the scoring New York needs, but
Mantle adds a double in the 4th and a 2-run homer, again lefty, in the 5th,
off Ralph Brickner, for a 6-0 lead. Boston will fade to a 6th place finish.

1955
Ted Williams gets his 2,000th hit, a first-inning bloop single, in a 5-3
Red Sox loss to the Yanks. Teddy Ballgame's hit comes off Bob Turley. Frank
Baumann, in his first ML start, takes the loss.

1956
Mantle hits his 40th homer, off Hal Brown, as the Yankees clip the Orioles,
10-5. Mantle is the first Yankee since DiMaggio, in 1937, to hit 40
homers. New York leads the AL by 8 1/2 games.

Don Newcombe's consecutive scoreless inning streak is snapped at 39 2/3,
but the Dodger righty wins his 18th of the year and 9th in a row, beating
the Phils, 5-2. Lopata's 2-run homer in the 7th is the Quaker scoring.

1957
The Red Sox take a pair from the Senators, winning 8-5 and 4-3 in 11
innings. In the nitecap, starter Dick Hyde intentionally walks pinch hitter
Ted Williams, the 27th time this year the slugger has been handed a free
base. Williams will be intentionally walked 33 times this year, the highest
AL total since the league started compiling this statistic in 1955.

At St. Louis, the Braves complete a 3-game sweep of the reeling Cards with a
5-1 win by Gene Conley. The Braves now lead the Cards by 5 1/2 games. Eddie
Mathews completes the Braves scoring with a homer to CF in the 5th, off
reliever Schmidt, and Boyer accounts for the Cards' score with a HR in
the 9th.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Phils trade shutouts. New York takes the
opener, 5-0, behind Curt Barclay's 3-hitter. Danny O'Connell hits a three-run
homer off Harvey Haddix, and Willie Mays bangs two triples. Willie has 15
so far and will top the 20 mark this year in doubles, triples and homers,
just the 4th player in history to accomplish that. George Brett will join
the list in 1979, the last 20th century player to do so. In the second game,
Mays has two of the three hits off Jack Sanford, who stops the Giants, 2-0.

1959
Gil Carter, a pitcher for the Carlsbad, New Mexico entry in the Sophomore
Baseball League, reportedly hits a ball that travels 730 feet from home
plate. The left field blast may be the longest homerun ever hit.

At Crosley Field, Joe Nuxhall fans 4 Braves in the 6th inning - Mathews,
Adcock, Crandall and Logan - and 10 overall as the Reds win, 4-3, to move
into 2nd place. The 3rd strike to Crandall gets by catcher Dutch Dotterer,
giving Nuxhall the chance for the 4 K's. Jim Davis, in 1956, was the last
pitcher to K four in a frame. In the first inning, Joe Adcock wishes Vada
Pinson a happy birthday by nabbing him at 1B with a hidden ball trick.

1961
In front of a packed County Stadium in Milwaukee, Braves lefty Warren
Spahn scatters six hits to beat the Cubs, 2-1, for his 300th victory. The
40-year-old southpaw, who will finish his career with 363 wins, the most of
any left-hander in the history of the game, is the thirteenth major league
hurler to reach the milestone.

In a classic pitching duel, White Sox lefty Billy Pierce and KC's Jim Archer
walk none and neither go to 3-2 in the count. Luis Aparicio's HR is the
only score as the Sox win 1-0 in 1 hour 32 minutes.

Mantle (44) and Maris (42) belt homers off reliever Pete Burnside to lead
New York to a 12-5 pasting of the Senators.

Vancouver (PCL) steals 9 bases in one inning in a 10-2 win against Salt
Lake City.

1962
The Dodgers protest the wetting down of the field at Candlestick, a tactic
they claim is to stop Maury Wills. Billy Pierce then hands 21-game winner
Don Drysdale his 5th loss, and the first after 11 straight wins, as the
Giants win, 5-4, to take the 2nd game in their series. Willie McCovey's
pinch-homer with two on is the big blow off Drysdale. The watering ploy
earns Giants manager Alvin Dark the sobriquet "The Swamp Fox."

At Fenway, the Red Sox sweep a day-night pair from Baltimore, winning 3-0 and
7-3. Ike Delock shuts out the Orioles, giving the Red Sox their 3rd shutout
in a row. Gene Conley and Bill Monbouquette had previously whitewashed the
Indians. Whitey Herzog's HR in the 6th of game 2 ends the Sox string of 32
2/3 scoreless innings.

The White Sox score 7 in the 4th and beat Kansas City, 11-2. Joe Cunningham
and Jim Landis each collect a single, double and triple, with Cunningham's
extra base hits coming in the 4th.

1963
In a New York-Penn League game at Batavia, Auburn edges Batavia, 1-0. Paul
Alspach of Auburn strikes out 24 Pirate batters.

1964
At Crosley Field, Joey Jay strikes out 13 Dodgers as the Reds win, 4-2.

1966
At Wrigley, the Cubs down Houston, 9-8, in 11 innings. The Cubs are led by C
Randy Hundley who hits for the cycle and drives in 3 runs. Houston is ahead
8-5 at the end of 7 innings in the nitecap when the game is suspended on
account of darkness. It'll be completed on August 26 with Houston winning,
9-8.

It is deja vu all over again, as Frank Robinson makes another game-saving
catch against the Yankees. Robby dives into the stands to rob Clete Boyer
of an 11th-inning homer, preserving a 6-5 Orioles win. Robby did it two
months earlier.

1967
In the 2nd inning of the first game of a doubleheader, Al Downing of the
Yankees strikes out the side on just 9 pitches. The Yanks beat the Indians,
5-3.

The Braves edge the Astros, 6-5, in 16 innings, winning on a game-ending
HR by Joe Torre. Both teams score once in the 14th and Mack Jones cuts down
Staub trying to score a 2nd run for Houston. Felipe Alou ties it up with a HR.

The Mets' Danny Frisella picks up his first ML win, but he's long gone
when the W is posted. Frisella pitches 6 2/3 innings before being lifted,
then races to the airport to catch a plane to take him to an Air National
Guard meeting in California. Don Shaw picks up the save in the 3-2 win over
the Pirates.

1968
As a pinch hitter, Gates Brown has two walk-off hits in Detroit's twin bill
sweep of the Red Sox at Tiger Stadium. His pinch homerun off Lee Stange
in the 14th inning ends the opener, 5-4, and the nightcap is decided when
he comes off the bench in the ninth and singles to right off Sparky Lyle
scoring Mickey Stanley giving the team from the Motor City a 6-5 victory.

Satchel Paige, 62 years or so old, and needing 158 days on a ML payroll
to qualify for a pension, is signed by the Braves. He will not pitch a
regular-season game for Atlanta and will become a coach on September 30th
and stay for another year.

1969
Don Drysdale retires because of damage to his right shoulder. Drysdale is
the last Brooklyn Dodger active with the Dodgers. Bob Aspromonte (1 AB),
who retires in 1971, will be the last active Brooklyn Dodger member.

1970
With a 6-5 victory over the Astros, Phillies right-hander Jim Bunning becomes
the first pitcher since Cy Young to win 100 games in both leagues. During
his nine years with the Tigers, the future U.S Senator compiled a 118-87
record in the American League.

With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Carl Taylor's walk-off
grand slam caps a five-run rally giving the Cardinals a dramatic comeback
victory over San Diego, 11-10. The pinch-hitter delivers his 'sayonora slam'
on the first pitch he sees from Ron Herbel.

1971
It's not my fault. Skip Lockwood accounts for the only Brewer tally when he
homers off Detroit's Joe Niekro. Each starter goes 7 innings in Detroit's
2-1 victory. The next homer by a Brewer pitcher will come when Milwaukee
is in the NL.

1972
The A's defeat the White Sox, 5-3, on Joe Rudi's 2-run HR in the 19th
inning off Stan Bahnsen. The game had been renewed after a 3-3 tie in 17
frames yesterday.

1973
White Sox rookie Brian Downing cracks his first major league hit, a homerun
off Detroit's Mickey Lolich. Downing's debut dinger is a first in the majors
since at least 1945 - an inside-the-park homer. It'll be matched in two
years by the Giants' Johnny LeMaster, who will do it in his first at-bat.

1975
George Foster has 5 hits to lead the Reds to a 9-3 win over the visiting Cubs.

1976
At Wrigley, the Cubs take a 10-1 lead after 3 innings only to lose to the
Reds, 13-10. Cincy scores 2 runs in the 6th, 4 in the 7th helped by a Johnny
Bench 3-run homer, one in the 8th and 2 runs in the 9th. Ken Griffey's
2-run homer in the 9th ties the game. The Reds continue scoring with 3 in
the 10th off Bill Bonham to hand the win to Pat Zachry.

1977
Two losses at Fenway today. The Red Sox lose to the Angels, 7-3, snapping
their 11-game win streak, and the Bristol Red Sox lose, 5-3, to the Eastern
League All-Stars.

1979
Joining Ted Williams (four seasons) and Jimmie Foxx (five seasons), Red Sox
slugger Jim Rice becomes the third player in franchise history to hit 30
homeruns in three consecutive seasons. The Red Sox outfielder's first-inning
homer isn't enough when Milwaukee beats Boston at Fenway Park, 9-6.

The Pirates' Ed Ott hits a grand slam off Phillie reliever Tug McGraw in the
8th inning as the Bucs win, 14-11. It is the 4th grand slam that McGraw has
yielded this year, setting a new NL mark and tying him for this questionable
honor with Detroit's Ray Narleski (1959).

1980
In the third inning of a 3-1 Yankee victory over the White Sox, Reggie
Jackson connects off of Britt Burns for his 400th career homerun (31st
this season). Mr. October will finish his 21-year career with 563 dingers,
placing him sixth on the all-time list when he retires in 1987.

1981
Ray Searage pitches two+ innings of hitless relief to be credited with
the win in New York's 4-2 victory over Chicago at Wrigley Field. With his
eighth-inning single, the right-hander gains the distinction of being the
only Met player to have compiled a 1.000 batting average (1 for 1) and a
1.000 winning percentage (1-0) while playing with the team.

1982
Tagged with the loss in the Twins' 6-3 defeat to California, Terry Felton's
career record drops to 0-14. The 24-year-old right hander, who will not
win a game in 55 major league appearances (0-16), establishes a new mark
for the worst individual start in baseball history, surpassing Guy Morton's
1914 record of 13 consecutive losses from the beginning of a career.

Houston's Nolan Ryan pitches his 8th career one-hitter, 3-0, at San
Diego. Terry Kennedy's 5th-inning single is the only Padres hit.

of Medich, the Brewers will sell Randy Lerch to Montreal on August 14. Doc
will win 5 games for the Brewers.

1986
Breaking Max Carey's mark, Cincinnati's Pete Rose sets a National League
record with his tenth five-hit game of his career. 'Charlie Hustle' singles
four times and doubles in the 13-4 loss to San Francisco. Rose has 3 RBIs.

The Cubs parade a record 10 pitchers in a 17-inning 10-8 loss to the
Pirates. Pittsburgh uses 7 hurlers. The game is a continuation of a contest
started on April 20, but was postponed because of darkness. Barry Jones,
the winning pitcher who strikes out the side, and Barry Bonds, who hit the
game-winning RBI, were in the minors when the game started. Loser Frank
DiPino started the season with Houston.

1987
Oakland A's first baseman Mark McGwire breaks Al Rosen's (1950) American
League rookie record by hitting his 38th homer. The unanimous choice for
Rookie of the Year will finish the season with 49 homers far surpassing
the major league record of 38, once jointly held by Frank Robinson (1956)
and Wally Berger (1930).

1988
After going 225 at-bats, Gary Carter finally hits his 300th career home
run as the Mets beat the Cubs, 9-6.

1991
In only his second big league start, 21-year-old White Sox southpaw Wilson
Alvarez no-hits the Orioles, 7-0. Only Browns hurler Bobo Holloman, who
threw a no-hitter in his first major league start in 1953 accomplished
the feat in fewer starts. Alvarez is the first rookie to throw a no-hitter
since 1983. In Alvarez' first start, on July 24, 1989, he did not retire
any of the 5 batters he faced, giving up 2 hits and 3 walks.

1993
Tigers OF Dan Gladden hits a grand slam in Detroit's 15-5 win over the
Orioles. Gladden also hit a grand slam in yesterday's game against Baltimore,
making him the 14th player in history to do so in consecutive games. Earlier
this year, Mike Blowers became the 13th player to match the mark.

1994
Randy Johnson's pitch to strike out A's Ernie Young will become the last
ball thrown in the major leagues for seven and half months. The longest work
stoppage in baseball history will cancel the remaining games on the schedule,
including the post-season, and will impact the start of 1995 campaign. Seattle
defeats Oakland today, 8-1, with Johnson going the distance for his 13th
win of the year.

1995
Kirk Gibson and Steve Bedrosian announce their retirements.

The Yankees trade OF Luis Polonia to the Braves for minor league OF Troy
Hughes.

ever. He logs on with the Pirates for a $2 million signing bonus.

1998
The Devil Rays surpass the two-million mark in home attendance in their
inaugural season joining the Rockies, Marlins and Arizona as the only
expansion teams to reach this mark.

At Fenway Park, a moment of silence is observed in memory of Detective
John Gibson, one of the police officers killed at the U.S. Capitol last
month. The Waltham, Massachusetts resident was a lifelong Red Sox fan.

The Yanks' David Wells stops the Twins on a 4-hitter to win, 7-0. In his
last start the Yankee lefty pitched a perfect game against the Twins.

2001
Enroute to his 11th victory when the Giants beat the Cubs at Wrigley Field,
9-4, Livan Hernandez goes 4 for 4 including his first ML homerun. The Cuban
right-hander has collected eight consecutive hits (and 12 for his last 13)
enjoying a 3 for 3 performance against the Phillies on August 5 and going
2 for 3 against the Pirates on the last day in July. For the first time in
his 16-year career, Barry Bonds hits his 50th homer of the season (off Chuck
Borowski). The 36-year-old Giants outfielder will go yard 23 more times to
establish a new big league single-season record with 73 homeruns. Bonds got
to 50 homers in the fewest number of games ever - 117. In 1999, Sammy Sosa
reached the mark in 121 contests.

Led by the 2 Giambi brothers, Oakland beats the visiting New York Yankees,
8-6, for their 10th straight win. Jason and Jeremy each club 2-run homers,
the 2nd time they've both gone deep in the same game. They did it twice
last year as well.

In the Twins' 4-3 loss to Tampa Bay, Minnesota 1B Doug Mientkiewicz makes
all 3 outs in the bottom of the 2nd without touching first base. The Devil
Rays have Toby Hall on 3B and Randy Winn on 1B with no outs in the inning
when Aubrey Huff hits a weak grounder to Mientkiewicz. The first sacker
crosses the diamond to chase Hall back to third then tags out Winn who had
run all the way around from first. Mientkiewicz then catches Hall wandering
off the base to complete an unassisted double play. The next Rays batter,
Jared Sandberg, hits a towering foul pop-up that Mientkiewicz catches for
the third out.

2002
Keeping with the tradition of commemorating former players who are in the
Hall of Fame, the Cardinals unveil the 11th statue outside Busch stadium -
an air-borne Ozzie Smith. The bronze likeness, created by sculptor Harry
Weber, captures the former shortstop stretched horizontally to the ground,
trying to field a grounder in the hole.

Sammy Sosa's grand slam and run-scoring double against the Rockies gives
the Cubs slugger 14 RBIs over two games establishing a new National League
record. The previous mark was 13 shared by Nate Colbert (Padres - 1972)
and Mark Whiten (Cardinals - 1993).

The Phillies beat the Dodgers, 5-3, as Philadelphia SS Jimmy Rollins strokes
5 hits and steals 2 bases.

Chipper Jones strokes 5 hits, including a pair of 2Bs, as the Braves rout
the Astros, 13-3.

2003
By fanning Jeff Kent in the seventh inning at Wrigley Field, Kerry Wood
became the fastest major leaguer to record his 1,000th career strikeout
needing only 134 games to reach the milestone. It took 143 games for Roger
Clemens to accomplish the feat. The Astros down the Cubs, 3-1.

The Royals beat the Yankees, 12-9, as the teams set an AL record by stroking
19 doubles. KC strokes 11 of the 2-baggers, just 1 shy of the AL mark.

2004
During the memorial service at St. Patrick's Cathedral in front of pews packed
with Mets fans, team owner Fred Wilpon and former broadcast partner Gary
Thorne deliver eulogies remembering the late Hall of Famer Bob Murphy. At
age of 79, 'Murph' who supplied 42 years of Happy Recaps for the Mets and
spent a half of a century broadcasting big league games, lost his battle
with lung cancer.

2005
Mets outfielders Carlos Beltran and Mike Cameron running at full speed
in an attempt to catch Padres David Ross' seventh-inning short fly to
short right-center dive head-first into each other in one of the horrific
collisions in baseball history. Right fielder Cameron, who suffers a broken
nose and multiple fractures of both cheekbones, will undergo facial surgery
in San Diego and his teammate, center fielder Carlos Beltran, fares a bit
better suffering a concussion and a small fracture in his cheekbone.

Jason Kendall and the A's steal a win from the Angels, 5-4, and moves into
first place in the AL west. When reliever Francisco Rodrguez muffs a routine
throw from the catcher, Kendall alertly sprints from 3B to score the winning
run in the 9th. It is the 2nd one-run win for the streaking A's over the
Angels. The A's trailed LA by 8 1/2 games on July 18 and have now won 20
of 23.

In Kansas City, Jeff Lieter hits a 7th-inning grand slam, off D.J. Carrasco,
to propel the Indians to a 4-2 win over the Royals. For the Royals it is
their 13th consecutive loss.

Greg Maddux (9-9) stops the Cubs' eight-game losing streak with an 11-4
complete game victory over St. Louis. It is his 314th career win, tying
him for 16th on the all-time list.

2006
For the second time in three days, Texas INF Mark DeRosa drives in 6 runs in
a game. He has 6 ribbies today on 3 hits as Texas beats Seattle, 14-7. On
August 9, DeRosa had 4 hits and 2 homers as Texas blanked the A's, 14-0,
behind 7 shutout innings by Vicente Padilla. Acquired two weeks ago by the
Rangers, pitcher Kip Wells goes on the 15 day DL. Wells has had two foot
injuries and two MRIs in two weeks, and leaves the game with a 12-4 score
in the 4th inning.

2008
A very pleasantly surprised Adam Dunn is traded by the Reds to the
Diamondbacks for minor league right-hander Dallas Buck and two players to
be named. In the midst of a losing season, Cincinnati continues to unload
its marque players with Dunn, the major league leader in homeruns (tied),
and future Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr being exchanged for prospects as
the team begins a rebuilding phase.

2010
In an 8-2 victory over Milwaukee at Miller Park, the Diamondbacks become
only the seventh team to hit four consecutive homeruns in an inning. In the
top of the fourth inning, Adam LaRoche, Miguel Montero, Mark Reynolds and
Stephen Drew all connect off Dave Bush, making the right-hander only the
third hurler in major league history to yield four straight round-trippers.

2014
The Royals, who haven't made the playoffs since winning the World Series in
1985, beat Oakland, 3-2, to take a half-game lead in the AL Central. Much
to the delight of 20,000 fans at Kauffman Stadium, Sung Woo, the South
Korean first-time visitor and the team's recent good luck charm, who
is well known to Royals fans for his long-time enthusiastic support for
the Kansas City club thanks to his active participation on Twitter under
the handle @Koreanfan_Kansas City, hangs the "W" on the outer wall of the
Royals Hall of Fame.

2015
For the first time in Major League history, all 15 home teams won on the
same day. Prior to this, the most games ever won by home teams on the same
day was 12 games. That record came more than a century ago, on May 23,
1914, according to Elias Sports Bureau.

2016
Rockies rookie outfielder David Dahl singles to right field off Rangers
starter Lucas Harrell, giving him a hit in 17 straight games to start his
big league career. The 22-year-old freshman’s streak, in which he is
batting .365 (23 of 63), equals the mark established by Reds third baseman
Chuck Aleno, who also hit in his first major league 17 games in May of 1941.

2021
Corbin Burnes of Milwaukee tied the Major League record for most consecutive
strikeouts by striking out ten Pittsburgh Pirates. Burnes tied the mark set
by the Mets' Tom Seaver on April 22, 1970 against the San Diego Padres and
equaled this year on June 25 by Aaron Nola against the New York Mets.

2022
Dylan Cease of the White Sox went 14 consecutive starts allowing one run or
fewer earned runs beginning on May 29 against the Chicago Cubs and through
today's game against the Kansas City Royals. It was the first time ever
a starting pitcher went on such a streak since the earned run became a
statistic in 1913, breaking the previous mark of 13 consecutive starts set
by Jacob deGrom in 2021.
