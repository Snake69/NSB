Giants player-coach Arlie Latham steals 2B in the Giants' 14-1 laugher over
the Phillies. At 49, he is the oldest player to swipe a base.

game from an opponent, this time beating the Reds, 1-0. His streak against
Cincinnati (according to historian Ed Hartig) started on April 15, 1906. It
is the 3rd shutout in a row for Chicago hurlers.

in the same inning. He does it in the 6th frame of a 9-0 beating of Brooklyn.

Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, sponsors the first National High School

results in his being signed by the Phillies.

1920
Wally Pipp hits a 2-run inside-the-park homer in the 9th inning, off Jim

RBIs for the Cubs.

1923

that Vernon set against them in 1922.

1924
It takes 17 innings, but the Reds prevail, 8-7, over the visiting
Giants. Cincinnati overcomes a 6-0 deficit to tie, then score 2 in the 17th
to win. Carl Mays was rear-ended in a car and knocked unconscious hours

1932

it is his 11th straight win over the Braves over 2 years.

1935
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants increase their lead to two games over the
Cardinals by beating the Reds, 8-4. Carl Hubbell wins and helps the offense
by hitting a HR. The big stick belongs to Giants CF Hank Lieber who slugs
a HR, a triple and 2 doubles.

At Detroit, Schoolboy Rowe is hit on the hand by a line drive in the 3rd
inning, but after a 12-minute delay, returns and allows just one more
hit. Detroit beats the Yankees, 6-0.

PH his next time up.

In St. Louis, Chief Hogsett starts both ends of a doubleheader for the Browns
in a split with the Tigers. The Chief gets chased in the opener, but reliever
Jack Knott ties up the 10-7 win for the Hornsbymen. The Tigers blow Hogsett
away in game 2 to win, 15-3, behind Eldon Auker. Except for Bobo Newsom
(3 times) no AL hurler will start twice in a day until Wilbur Wood, in 1973.

Babe Herman jumps the Reds and is suspended by GM Larry MacPhail. Herman
contends he has not received a promised bonus of $250 twice a month for

Carl Hubbell is forced to leave the mound in a 5-3 loss to the Dodgers when

gave Ferrell a 10-day severance package.

1940
The Sunday New York Daily News publishes a shocking article written by
its sports editor, Jimmy Powers, suggesting that the 5th place Yankees,
had been hit by a "mass polio epidemic." Powers charges that Lou Gehrig's
"infantile paralysis" had infected the other Yankees, accounting for the
team's uncharacteristic reversal of form. The article immediately causes a
sensation among readers and fans. At Gehrig's request, Milton Eisenberg,
a Brooklyn attorney, brings suit for $1 million against Powers and the
newspaper charging that Gehrig's reputation and credit had been hurt and that
the article had caused him considerable mental anguish. Other angry Yankees,
including Bill Dickey (Gehrig's roommate), also file suit against the News,
causing the newspaper to issue a public apology on September 26. The three and
a half column story appears under the headline "OUR APOLOGIES TO LOU GEHRIG
AND THE YANKEES." In his apology, Powers admits he had no business getting
"snarled up in medical controversy," stating "Gehrig has no communicable
disease and was not suffering from the mysterious polio germ that supposedly
played havoc with the Yankee ball club." Lou is a personal hero, Powers
adds. "Hurting his feelings was far from my mind."

1941
The Dodgers notch the win over the Pirates, 6-5, despite 6 errors. Pete
Reiser's homer in the 9th wins it for reliever Casey, and increases the
Brooks lead over the idle Cardinals to one game.

The Reds sweep a pair from the bumbling Phillies, winning 13-5 and 5-4. In
the first game, the Reds build a 10-1 lead after 2 innings and are helped
in the win by 8 Phillies errors, which ties a team record set in 1922 (a
record the Phils list as a post-1911 one). Bill Werber has 3 hits and 5 RBIs.

1942
After going 1-6 before the All-Star break, Carl Hubbell posts his 8th

1943
In a trade that will benefit Washington, the Senators send Ellis Clary,
Ox Miller and cash to the Browns for Johnny Niggeling and Harlond
Clift. Niggeling will split 48 decisions as a Senator, while Miller will
win just 3 in St. Louis.

In a doubleheader split, the Cards' Harry Walker has his 29-game hit streak
stopped by the Phils. His streak started on July 21. The Cards win 6-0,
then lose game 2, 6-3.

Carl Hubbell wins his 253rd and final game, all with the Giants, as he beats

and 33,723, the Dodgers donate all the receipts of the night game to the
Brooklyn War Memorial Fund.

1948
At Philadelphia, Rex Barney fires a one-hitter, beating the Phils, 1-0. The
lone hit is a looping single by Ralph Caballero that just eludes a diving

9th. The 2nd-place Bums score their lone run in the first when Robin Roberts
wild pitches home Brooks from 3B.

loss on Russ Meyer. Stan Rojek has 4 hits for the Pirates, while Pafko
drives home three runs on three hits for Chicago.

pace the New Yorkers. The Braves lead Brooklyn by a game.

1950
A's lefty Lou Brissie gives up just one Yankee hit in the last 5 innings,
but it's a critical one. With the score 2-2 in the top of the 9th, DiMaggio

and hand the Mackmen their 6th straight loss.

1952

an umpire.

The Indians get infielder George Strickland and pitcher Ted Wilks from
Pittsburgh for Johnny Berardino, minor leaguer Charlie Sipple and $50,000. For
Berardino, it is his 2nd tour of duty with the Pirates, but he should be
used to it ... he had two stints with the Indians and two with the Browns.

1956
Redlegs OF Bob Thurman hits a double and 3 consecutive HRs. Ted Kluszewski
and Frank Robinson add 2 HRs each, and Wally Post, one, in a 13-4 win
over Milwaukee at Crosley Field. Toby Atwell and Joe Adcock belts round
trippers for the Braves. The 8 HRs ties a since-topped ML record. There are
three pairs of back to back homers in the game:  Klu and Post in the 3rd;
Thurman and Klu in the 7th; and Robinson and Thurman in the 8th. The Reds
have now hit homers in each game since August 4, a streak that will reach
21 games and 41 homers through August 24th. Thurman is the 4th Reds player
this year to bang 3 homers.

innings, but the Braves chip away and finally tie it with a run in the
9th. The Dodgers make it 6-5 in the 11th but Hank Aaron takes Drysdale deep
to tie it up. Drysdale is finally relieved and LA wins it in the 13th, 7-6.

the Continental League.

1960
Lew Burdette pitches a no-hitter beating Gene Conley and the Phillies,
1-0. The Braves right-hander hits Tony Gonzalez with a fifth-inning pitch

play. The Milwaukee pitcher also scores the only run of the game.

Bob Sprout sets a Midwest League record with 22 strikeouts, and pitches a
7-inning no-hitter as Decatur defeats Waterloo 3-0. The 18-year-old lefty
needs a dropped foul ball for his chance at the record. Sprout will pitch
just one game in the ML, with the Angels in 1961.

1961
Ron Kline, purchased from the Angels on August 10, blanks the Red Sox on
4 hits to give the Tigers a 5-0 win. Bill Monbouquette fails for the 9th

Aaron of the Braves hits a HR off Curt Simmons, but has it nullified (and
Aaron is called out) when umpire Chris Pelekoudas says Aaron stepped out
of the batter's box when he made contact. The home plate umpire's decision
is influenced by Cardinal catcher Bob Uecker who is jumping up and down
insisting the eventual homerun champion had step out of the batter's box.

In a 3-2 Orioles win over the Red Sox, Brooks Robinson hits into his 3rd
triple play, tying the record of George Sisler, who banged into triple
plays in 1921, 1922 and 1926.

Pittsburgh 3B Jose Pagan ties the modern NL record for errors in an inning
with 3, but Pittsburgh coasts to a 9-3 win over the Mets.

Angels' Jack Hamilton. Hit on the left cheekbone, just below the eye socket,
The 22-year-old will miss the rest of 1967 and all of 1968. He was hitting
.267 with 20 HRs and 67 RBIs in 95 games. Despite the loss of Tony C, the Red
Sox will sweep the 4-game series with the Angels. The sweep will still leave
Minnesota in 1st place, with Boston, Detroit and Chicago all within 2 games.

Lew Krausse of the A's is suspended by owner Charlie Finley for rowdyism
and conduct unbecoming a ML player.

1968
In the opener of a doubleheader at Wrigley Field, umpire Chris Pelekoudas
calls 3 illegal pitches on Cubs P Phil Regan, twice allowing a retired batter
to hit again. Pete Rose singles after a called 3rd strike. Pelekoudas
can't find any evidence on Regan and bases his calls on "the flight
of the ball." The Cubs, who lose both games, 2-1 and 6-3, protest the
ump's calls. The next day Warren Giles meets with Cubs officials and
orders Pelekoudas to apologize to the church-going Regan, whom he calls a
"fine Christian gentleman." However, at the ML winter meetings, the Rules
Committee will further amend the spitball rule to allow an ump to call an
illegal pitch based on the flight of the ball.

Pitching for Hawaii (PCL) Bo Belinsky twirls a no-hitter, defeating Tacoma,
1-0. Bo will fail next year in a comeback attempt with the Cardinals.

of the plate.

1977

blanks the Giants, 7-0. The lone hit is Marc Hill's two-out single in the 8th.

1979
After 6 straight wins, the 3rd place Brewers lose to Texas, 7-3. But the

with a team record 1,918,343 in attendance.

The Yankees sell Ray Burris (1-3) to the Mets.

1980
In a game called after 6 1/2 innings because of rain, the Cardinals defeat
the Reds, 10-1, behind Ken Forsch. Forsch helps in the 5th, getting all
3 outs on grounders back to him. Ted Simmons is 4 for 4 with 4 runs and a
pair of homers, including one in the Cards' 8-run 2nd inning. Keith Smith
provides little help in the frame making all 3 outs, hitting into a 4-6-3
DP, and then 8 men later ending the inning with a strikeout.

1982

when he steps up the plate for the 13,941st time.

the Dodgers beat the Cubs, 2-1 in 21 innings (in the second longest game in
Cubs franchise history), despite running out of position players and having
to use pitchers Fernando Valenzuela and Bob Welch in the outfield. Dusty
Baker wins it in the 21st inning with a sacrifice fly. Jerry Reuss pitches
the final 4 innings for the win, then starts the regularly scheduled game
and wins again, 7-4.

The Reds play 14 innings and overcome a 5-1 Mets lead to win, 7-6. Cesar
Cedeno singles in the winning run. Tomorrow, they will win in the 10th
against the Mets, 3-1, on Ron Oester's HR.

1983
In the continuation of the "Pine Tar Game," Hal McRae strikes out for the
last KC out and Dan Quisenberry retires the Yankees in order in the bottom
of the 9th to preserve the Royals' 5-4 victory. The conclusion takes just
12 minutes (and 16 pitches) and, as the only game scheduled at the Stadium,
is witnessed by a crowd of 1,245. An odd feature of the game is lefty Don
Mattingly playing 2B and pitcher Ron Guidry in CF, as the Yanks try to
cover all the options.

1984
Detroit's Juan Berenguer goes 8 1/3 innings and strikes out 12 to give the
Tigers a 4-3 victory over the Mariners. Kirk Gibson drives in three runs with

to the Pirates for Glenn Wilson.

In a 9-2 Toronto win, Baltimore SS Cal Ripken plays in his 1,208th consecutive
game, passing Steve Garvey for the 3rd longest streak in ML history. George
Bell leads Toronto with 2 singles, a double and a HR.

1991
Toronto's first two hitters - Devon White and Roberto Alomar - hit homeruns
off Detroit's Bill Gullickson in the Blue Jays' 4-2 win. Gullickson teed
up leadoff homers once before, in the NL.

1992
In a 7-6 loss to the Astros, the Cardinals make 2 errors, by Lankford
and Woodson (1st inning), the first St. Louis errors in 17 games. The 16
straight errorless games (7/30 - 8/16) sets a ML record.

1993

Sox. Dan Pasqua's triple with 1 out in the 8th inning is Chicago's only
safety.

1995

save when the Cardinals edge Atlanta, 4-3. The Kansas City native becomes
the seventh pitcher in major league history to reach this milestone.

of 26-7. A 2 1/2 hour rain delay interrupted the contest which takes more
than 6 hours to play. OF Luis Gonzalez drives home 6 runs for Chicago
while Sammy Sosa goes 4 for 4 with 4 RBIs and 4 runs scored. Several ML
records are tied by the Cubs:  9 teammates each score 2 or more runs (Scott
Servais and Sosa score 4, while Mark Grace plates 3); 14 Cubs hit safely,
and 26 RBIs (ties the NL mark) are collected. The Cubs now have scored 20
or more runs 39 times, extending their ML record. Kevin Foster pitches the

departing to rest with the Cubs up, 9-1. Andrew Young picks up an easy win
with 1 1/3 innings of relief.

drove in 8 runs in a game.

Yankees announcer, and former SS, Phil Rizzuto retires as team broadcaster
after 39 years at the mike, reportedly because WPIX-TV refused to allow
him to miss a game to attend teammate Mickey Mantle's funeral. Rizzuto
eventually will return for the 1996 season.

1996

drives home 6 runs to lead the Indians to an 11-3 victory over the Tigers.

the score in the bottom half of the inning with 3 runs of their own. The score
remains tied at 10-10 going into the 12th inning. Seattle scores 3 in the top
half of the inning, 2 on 1B Paul Sorrento's 2nd homer of the game. New York

in the 11th to beat the Yankees, 9-8. It is the 1st time in 12 years that
the New Yorkers blow a 5-run lead in the 9th inning. Tim Salmon becomes

Downing's total, who had established the Halo mark in 1990.

2001

Ivan Rodriguez' grand slam is the big blow for Texas.

Randy Johnson is not sharp, but he's good enough to give Arizona a 5-3 win
over the Cubs. It is the Big Unit's 10th straight win over the Cubs going
back to September 20, 1988. The loss leaves the Cubs a game ahead of Houston
in the NL Central and puts the Diamondbacks 2 1/2 games ahead of the Giants
in the West.

Danny Almonte, pitching for the Bronx Little League entry, the Rolando Paulino
All-Stars, hurls the first perfect game since 1957 in the Little League WS,
beating the eventual winner, Apopka, FL, 2-0. The Bronx team will win next
week, but all the victories will be stripped from them when an investigation
proves a number of rule infractions, not the least of which is that Almonte is
too old. His brother, who pitched last year, will also be shown to be too old.

2002
In a pregame ceremony, Tommy Agee is inducted posthumously into the Mets
Hall of Fame. The Mets' center fielder (1968-72) is best remembered for
his two great two catches in Game 3 of the 1969 World Series.

The Rangers stop the Blue Jays, 10-7, as SS Alex Rodriguez ties a ML record
by becoming the 4th player to hit 6 HRs in a 3-game span. His 2 round-trippers
give him the AL lead with 44.

2003
The Expos knock off the suddenly slumping Giants, 4-0, behind a 3-hitter by
Javier Vazquez. Without Bonds, the Giants lose all 4 games to Montreal and
finish the season series, 0-7, the first time in their 128-year history they
have been swept in a season series (they were 0-3 vs. Texas in 1999). Montreal
also took all 6 games this year with Milwaukee and swept the Padres, 12-0,
in 1994. Despite the loss, the Giants are still 8 1/2 games ahead of the
Diamondbacks in the NL West.

The Mets shut out the Rockies, 8-0, as Steve Trachsel hurls his 2nd one-hitter
of the season. Colorado pitcher Chin-hui Tsao's double in the 6th inning
is the Rockies' only hit.

2004
The Spokane Indians (Texas Rangers) edge the Tri-City Dust Devils (Colorado
Rockies), 2-1 in 23 innings. The Northwest League game, which lasted 6 hours
37 minutes, was scoreless for 19 innings and suspended in a 1-1 tie in the
21st inning the previous night.

2005
The Rangers defeat the Mariners, 8-6. They hit 5 HRs in the contest to
break the ML record for most HRs at home, surpassing the Colorado Rockies
who hit 149 in 1996.

2006
At Fenway Park, the Yankees beat the Red Sox in the night cap to complete
a day-night doubleheader sweep. The 14-11 slugfest, in which the Al East
Division rivals bang out a total 34 hits, takes 4 hours 45 minutes to play
making it the longest nine-inning game in big league history. A team scores
in nine of the 18 half-innings. The doubleheader also clocks a record at
8 hours 40 minutes.

Mike Lieberthal passes Red Dooin to become the Phillies' all-time leader in
games as a catcher. The former Philadelphia backstop, who caught 1,124 games
from 1902-14, is given credit for being the first catcher to wear shinguards
(1906) and as player-manager (1914) tried but failed to convince owner William
Barker to buy three promising players from Baltimore's International League
franchise, which included a pitcher named Babe Ruth.

Blanking the Mariners for seven innings at Angel Stadium, Jered Weaver joins
Whitey Ford (Yankees, 1950) to become only the second American League rookie
to begin a career with nine straight victories as a starter. The 23-year-old
Angel hurler will need to win his next four games to match Hooks Wiltse
(Giants, 1904) who started his freshman season with 13 consecutive wins.

Alfonso Soriano becomes the third player in big league history to compile
four seasons of 30 homers and 30 stolen bases. With his second-inning swipe
of second base in a 6-4 victory over the Phillies, the Nationals outfielder
joins Barry and Bobby Bonds in accomplishing the feat for the fourth time.

2007
Micah Owings, with two homeruns, a double and a single, compiles 11 total
bases in the Diamondbacks' 12-6 victory over the Braves, the most for a hurler
since Braves right-hander Jim Tobin had 12 with his three homers in 1942. In
addition to driving in six runs and scoring four times, the Arizona rookie
tosses seven innings of three-hit ball to win his sixth game of the season.

2010
The front-running Braves acquire slugger Derrek Lee from the Cubs for three
minor league pitchers. As a ten-year veteran, who had played at least five
years with the same team, the 34-year-old first baseman rejected a trade
to the Angels last month because he thought LA had too much of a deficit
to make up in the AL West race.

2011
Mike Jacobs becomes the first professional baseball player to be suspended
for testing positive for human growth hormone. The 30-year-old Rockies minor
league first baseman, who has played for the Mets, Marlins and and Royals,
is handed a 50-game suspension for his involvement with HGH.

2012
Adam Dunn becomes the 50th major leaguer to hit 400 career homeruns when
he goes deep in the eighth inning with a two-run blast off Tim Collins
in a White Sox loss to Kansas City at Kauffman Stadium. The 32-year-old
Chicago first baseman joins Paul Konerko in reaching the milestone this
season making them the first teammates in baseball history to hit their
400th round-tripper in the same year playing for the same team.

2015
The Red Sox hire Dave Dombrowski, who was replaced as the president and
general manager of the Tigers earlier this month, to run the organization's
baseball operations. Ben Cherington, after leading Boston to the World
Series two seasons ago, declines to continue as the GM of the last-place
team, but will assist during the club's transition.

2019
Pete Alonso hit his 40th homerun, setting a National League rookie record
previously set by Cody Bellinger in 2017.
