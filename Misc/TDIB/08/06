1902
The Pirates shut out the Giants for the 2nd day in a row, as Jack Chesbro

and will be suspended for the season and then released by the Giants.

1903
At Philadelphia, the A's top the Boston Americans, 4-3, in a game called
after 8 innings because of dark clouds. Boston manager Jimmy Collins protests
to no avail.

1904
Lefthander Nick Altrock of the White Sox (their new nickname), enroute
to the first of three 20-win seasons, handles 13 fielding chances - the
modern ML record for pitchers - in an 8-1 victory over the Athletics. He
will finish the year with 49 putouts, an AL record for pitchers.

At the Polo Grounds, 20,488 watch the Giants roll over St. Louis,
8-1. Mathewson, the winner, exits after 6 innings, and is replaced by
Red Ames.

1905
At Cincinnati, the Reds and Brooklyn split a twinbill. Brooklyn wins
the opener, 6-3, and the Reds take the nitecap, 2-0, behind Bob Ewing's
2-hitter. The two teams tie the ML record by handing out just one walk in
the 2 games.

Kid Nichols, fired in May as the player-manager of the Cardinals, pitches
the Phillies to a 2-1 victory over his old team. The Kid will go 10-6 with
the Phillies this year.

1906
At Cleveland's League Park, the Boston Americans, who will become known
as the Red Sox, are shut out for the fourth consecutive time bowing to the
Indians, 4-0. Combined with a scoreless three-game sweep by the White Sox,
the team establishes a new American League record.

In New York, Art Devlin and John McGraw are tossed for abusing umpire James
Johnstone during a 3-1 loss to Chicago. The two will be suspended. Three
Finger Brown is the winner over Joe McGinnity, who is making his first
appearance after being suspended for 10 days and fined $100 for an altercation
with Peitz in Pittsburgh.

Despite two homeruns by Branch Rickey, both off reliever Walter Clarkson
and one inside-the-park, the Browns fall to the visiting Highlanders, 8-6,
when New York rallies for 3 in the 9th. It is the first two-homer game by a
Browns player. Rickey hit the first of his three career homers four days ago.

1908
A scheduled doubleheader in Brooklyn with St. Louis is washed out after 5
innings of the first game, but lefty Johnny Lush, with one no-hitter over
Brooklyn under his belt, allows no Brooklyn hits in his outing. The Cards
win 2-0, on 2 unearned runs, as 1B Tim Jordan drops a fly ball with the
bases loaded.

1912
Inspired in part by the Cobb suspension and the Tigers' brief strike in May,
the formation of a Players' Fraternity is announced, headed by attorney
and former player Dave Fultz. Leading players include Cobb, Mathewson,
Mickey Doolan and Jake Daubert. The goals are to oppose contract violations,
rowdyism, and anything that may "impair a player's ability." At one point,
a strike will be called for a Brooklyn attempt to send an obscure player,
Harry Kraft, down to Newark, but many teams balk at the strike call, and
it is rescinded.

At Cleveland, Joe Wood gives up 13 hits in an 11-inning 5-4 win for Boston. He
strikes out 5 in running his record to 23-4.

1913
The Pirates pound Giants ace Mathewson for 10 hits and 9 runs in 5 innings,
including 7 in the 5th. C Larry McLean is traded from the last-place
Cardinals to the Giants for Doc Crandall. One of the biggest players of
this era at 6 feet 5 inches and 230 pounds, the veteran catcher will bat
.500 in the WS. The popular Crandall will make 2 pinch hitting appearances
before the Giants reacquire him in a week.

1914
Rabbit Maranville cracks a 10th-inning homer to give the Braves their 9th
win in a row, a 5-4 topper over Pittsburgh.

Vic Saier starts the Chicago scoring with a solo homer off Mathewson. The
Cubs score two in the 8th and two in the 9th to edge the Giants, 4-3. The
Giants now lead the Braves by 6 1/2 games.

1916
Red Sox pitcher Rube Foster allows 3 hits in beating the Browns, 1-0. Most
of the hitting in the game comes when Browns 3B Jimmy Austin and Boston
C Chet Thomas mix it up. The Sox end the day .002 ahead of the White Sox,
but will take 3 out of 4 in Chicago to open up some room.

1917
Veteran Eddie Plank, 41, hooks up with Washington's Walter Johnson in a
brilliant 11-inning duel, won 1-0 by Johnson. For Plank, this is the last
game of his oustanding career, and he will announce his retirement in a
week, citing stomach problems as the reason. Pitching for the hapless Browns
doesn't help as Plank's 1.79 ERA this season results in just a 5-6 record.

Boston Red Sox hurler Rube Foster allows just one hit - a double by Harris -
in losing to Cleveland, 2-0.

1918
John Tener resigns as President of the NL in a dispute over the Scott Perry
case. Tener, NL Prexy since 1913, refused to serve on the National Commission
unless the AL abided by the awarding of Perry to the Boston Braves. But
when the Commission awarded the minor leaguer to the Athletics, it was a
foregone conclusion that Tener would step down. Tener, a former Governor
of Pennsylvania, almost quit in December but stayed on when the owners said
the job would not interfere with his business interests. John Heydler will
serve as acting president and it is he who will arrange a compromise solution
... Connie Mack pays Boston $2,500 and keeps Perry (henceforth a loser).

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants' Pete Compton drives home Art Fletcher in
the bottom of the 9th to beat Matty's Reds, 4-3. Bob Steele, acquired from
the Bucs, is the winner over Jimmie Ring. Lee Magee, with his face swollen
after yesterday's fight, sits out the game for the Reds and Heinie Zimmerman,
on doctor's orders to avoid the near 90+ degree heat, watches for the Giants.

At Ebbets Field, the first place Cubs keep their lead of 6 1/2 games by
beating the Robins, 6-3, behind Lefty Tyler. Tyler scatters 9 hits, including
one by Zack Wheat, who stretches his consecutive hitting skein to 25 games.

With the temperature at 115 degrees on the field at Detroit, the Tigers outhit
the Red Sox, 14-12, but the Sox win the game, 7-5 in 10 innings. Starter
Carl Mays is victorious over reliever Rudy Kallio.

At Cleveland, the Indians stay 3 1/2 games behind Boston by edging Washington,
1-0, in the 10th. Second baseman Smoky Joe Wood leads off the 10th with a
triple and pinch runner Doc Evans scores the winner. Starter Jim Bagby is
the winning pitcher despite allowing 11 hits.

In the 10-2 Pittsburgh win at Philadelphia, Buc catcher W.J. Smith collapses
in the 7th but is revived with ice and continues in the heat. Ump Hank
O'Day collapses in the 8th but also recovers to continue.

1919
The Cincinnati Times-Star notes that in each of the first 3 innings of
Brooklyn's 6-1 victory over the Reds, Jimmy Johnston faces a different
Cincinnati pitcher - Slim Sallee, Ray Fisher and Dolf Luque - and raps each
one for a single as Brooklyn gets all their runs in the first 3 frames. Luque
finishes the game, allowing no more runs.

In Chicago, Cubs P Grover Alexander loses, 2-0, to the Braves when Boston
P Ray Keating hits a fly ball that bounces through a hole in the wire fence
in CF for a homer. It is Keating's lone career homer. He holds the Cubs to
3 hits.

1920
Ruth clouts 2 more homers, giving him 41, to lead the Yanks to an 11-7 victory
over the Tigers. Both homers are off Hooks Dauss, who is given the hook in the
8th. Quinn pitches 2 innings for New York before being lifted for Mogridge.

1922
In St. Louis, Walter Johnson gives up the first grand slam of his career, a
3rd-inning shot by Jack Tobin, as the Browns top the Senators, 8-4. George
Sisler is 2 for 2 against the Big Train, as Urban Shocker picks up the
victory.

1927
At Philadelphia, the A's split a pair with the Browns, winning 5-4 in 12
innings before losing the 2nd, 2-0. In the nitecap, the A's Jack Quinn and
rival Alvin Crowder both allow just 2 hits, though one of the Brownie hits
is a solo HR by Ken Williams. The other run is a steal of home by O'Rourke.

As the Cubs win their 7th straight, Pittsburgh loses 9-2 to the Giants,
dropping them 3 games behind Chicago. Buc manager Donie Bush benches Kiki
Cuyler for not using a take out slide at second base and Kiki will not play
the rest of the season or the WS.

With Berg catching Ted Lyons, the White Sox beat the Yankees, 6-3. Lazzeri
tests Berg's arm by swiping 2B, but later Berg makes a scoop and tag at
home on a throw from the outfield.

1928
At Philadelphia, Hack Wilson clouts two homers, #25 and #26, for the Cubs,
but the Phillies still emerge the winners, 8-7. Veteran Bob McGraw is the
victor over Sheriff Blake. The Phils, with the worst record in baseball,
also win the nitecap, 5-1, as Alex Ferguson beats Charlie Root. The Phils
will whip the Cubs tomorrow, 4-2, dropping Chicago into 4th place, and
improving the Phillies' record to 27-70.

In Chicago, the Sox drop the stumbling Yankees, 5-4, in 15 innings. Willie
Kamm triples home the run that gives Grady Adkins the win. George Pipgras
takes the loss.

1929
In a Ladies Day game at Wrigley that draws 29,000 women and 11,000 men,
the Cubs have their 5-game win streak stopped by Brooklyn, 5-4, despite
Hornsby's 23rd HR of the year. Brooklyn's Jughead Johnny Morrison is the
winner over Chicago ace Pat Malone. But Chicago will win their next three.

After the visiting Senators outslug the Yankees, 13-11, New York earns a
split, 8-0, on two homers by Babe Ruth. The first is a grand slam in the
5th, his 26th homer of the year. Heimach scatters 3 hits to earn the nitecap
win. Buddy Myers' 4 hits, including 3 doubles in the opener, paces a 14-hit
Senators attack. Durst, Cronin and West homer for Washington.

1930
At Katy Park, Eugene Mercantelli, under the name Gene Rye, hits 3 HRs
in the 8th inning as Waco (Texas) racks up 18 runs in the inning against
Beaumont. Waco wins 22-4. The 5' 6" Rye will have 39 ML at-bats and get
7 hits, all singles. Rye sets 4 organized baseball records for one inning
with 12 total bases, 9 extra bases, 3 HRs and 8 RBI (since tied). The Texas
League outfielder's round trippers in the minor league game include a solo
shot, a two-run homer and a grand slam. In 1931, Rye will hit .179 for the
Red Sox in 17 games.

1932

only hit off Cleveland's Wes Ferrell. The ace wins, 3-0, over Rhodes for

win and a sweep of their series with the Cubs. Dizzy Dean wins his 18th. The
Birds now lead Chicago by 3 games.

The Reds trade P Si Johnson to the Cardinals for Bill Walker. Johnson was
46-86 in Cincinnati.

1937
For the second time in the 20th century, the first two batters in a game -
Roy Johnson and Rabbit Warstler of the Boston Bees - lead off with HRs. The
mark will be tied a month later, and surpassed by San Diego in 1987. The
two homers come off Tex Carleton, who will come back in two days to pitch a
complete game win over the Bees. Waving off the Bee stings, the Cubs sweep
today, 12-6 and 6-2. Curt Davis wins the opener over Ira Hutchinson and
Roy Parmelee notches the win in the nitecap against Guy Bush.

In a 10-inning oddity Cleveland outfielders have no chances against the
Yankees. Feller takes a 5-2 lead into the 9th, but the Yankees knot the
score. In the 10th, Hal Trosky hits his 2nd homer, off reliever Johnny
Murphy, for a 6-5 Indian lead, and Joe Heving replaces Feller. The Yanks
put runners on 2nd and 3rd and Joe DiMaggio hits a drive which 3B Odell
Hale deflects into foul territory for an apparent double. But the plate
umpire calls it foul, and with both runners scoring, the Indians LF fails
to chase after the ball. The Yanks argue vehemently, and finally the
plate ump Charlie Johnson consults with the umpire at 3b George Moriarty,
who overrules Johnson, allowing the winning run to score because of the
outfield's idleness. The Indians storm Moriarty (a former Yank), yelling
that, since the ball had not reached the base, the call was the home plate
ump's to make and should not be overruled. The protest will be upheld
and the game will be replayed on September 15. In his 9 innings pitched,
Feller racks up an unusual double-double, walking 10 and striking out 12.

1938
Ailing Mickey Cochrane is fired as Detroit manager and replaced by Del Baker.

Former AL pitcher George Pipgras joins the league's umpiring staff.

they win, 11-6, at Brooklyn.

Behind Lou Fette, the Bees edge the Cubs, 1-0. Vance Page is the loser.

1939
With the Tigers ahead, 10-1, the Red Sox put Jimmie Foxx on the mound for
the 9th inning. The slugger retires all three batters, one via a strikeout.

1940
In an 11-0 laugher, rookie Sid Hudson one-hits the A's on his way to a
17-win season for the hapless Senators. It's his second 1-hit shutout this
year. Hudson pitched for Sanford (Class D Florida) last year and was 24-4.

1941
In the 3rd inning against the Indians, Detroit P Al Benton collects 2
sacrifices bunts, a ML record, as the Tigers send 17 men to the plate. Detroit
scores a ML record-tying (for the inning) 11 runs on 6 hits, 7 walks and
2 errors. That's all the scoring needed, as Detroit rolls, 11-2, for a
Benton victory.

In a mid-week doubleheader at Boston, the Red Sox and Yankees split, New
York taking the lidlifter, 6-3, and the Sox the nitecap, 3-1. Williams is 1
for 6 but Pete Fox has a pair of hits in each game for Boston. In his last
5 games, Fox has collected 2 triples, 6 doubles and 6 singles.

In the Giants-Dodgers game, Bill Klem umps his first game of the year. Klem is
filling in for Larry Goetz, whose arm was fractured when a foul ball hit him.

1942
An editorial in The Sporting News argues for segregation on the diamond. The
column states that members of each race "prefer to draw their talents from
their own ranks and both groups know their crowd psychology and do not care
to run the risk of damaging their own game."

1943
Pittsburgh's Rip Sewell, now throwing his blooper pitch some 25 feet high,
loses to the Cardinals, 8-3, after 11 straight wins. He has won 18 already
but will get only 3 more victories the rest of the season. Max Lanier is
the winning pitcher.

1944
The Cardinals top the Reds, 5-4, in the 13th inning on doubles by Max Lanier
and Johnny Hopp. Earlier, St. Louis rookie pitcher Ted Wilks was struck by
a line drive off the bat of Steve Mesner and was knocked out. He left the
field on a stretcher and was taken to Cincinnati's Christ Hospital.

The Cubs 11-game winning streak comes to an abrupt end as the host Pirates
win twice, 13-5 and 5-4. Preacher Roe wins his 7th game in the opener with
1 1/3 innings of relief and pitches 2+ innings of hitless relief to finish
the nitecap.

At Brooklyn, the Braves score 10 runs in the top of the 9th to turn a 4-3
nail biter into a 14-4 victory in game 1. Boston tallies 21 hits. The Braves
win the nitecap, 8-7.

1947
Can a pinch runner drive in a run? Skeeter Webb of the Tigers takes the
paths for Freddie Hutchinson against the Indians and scores. Detroit bats
around, and Webb lifts a fly ball that scores a run in the 9-run 8th. Stubby
Overmire wins, 13-6, in the first of 2. Detroit sweeps, winning the nitecap,
7-5, behind Fred Hutchinson.

1948
The Reds release Johnny Neun as manager and pick Bucky Walters to succeed
him. The change doesn't help today as Brooklyn's Rex Barney wins, 4-1.

1949
Despite 3 balks which set a NL record, Adrian Zabala picks up his 2nd win
since returning from Mexico, as the Giants beat the Cardinals, 3-1. A balk
call in the 1st inning by Jocko Conlin aids Zabala, nullifying a homerun
by Nippy Jones. Jones then flies out. Zabala's 3 balks erases the record
of 2 balks set by Bob Brown of the Braves on July 23, 1933. The loss leaves
the Redbirds a half game ahead of the Dodgers, who bow to the Reds.

1950
Boston P Ellis Kinder hits a grand slam off White Sox ace Billy Pierce,
and totals 6 RBIs in the game. Kinder's HR comes after an intentional
pass to Birdie Tebbetts. For "Old Folks," it is his first and only career
homer. The Red Sox roll, 9-2. Kinder also stops rookie Chico Carrasquel's
consecutive game batting steak of 24 games. Joe Dobson gives up 7 hits in
the nitecap and wins, 4-3, to give the Bosox a sweep.

Sal Maglie and Larry Jansen of the Giants both hurl shutouts, winning 3-0
and 5-0 respectively, against the Pirates.

major league history to hurl a complete-game shutout beating Virgil 'Fire'
Trucks and the Tigers, 1-0, when Bobby Young scores the game's only run in
the 12th inning. Paige strikes out 9. The Browns' hurler will extend his
own record at the age of 46 years and 75 days by throwing another scoreless
complete game against the White Sox next month.

The last-place Pirates jolt the pennant hopes of the Giants by sweeping a
doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, 7-0 and 10-8. The 2 wins match the Corsairs
longest win streak of the year and knocks the Giants to 6 1/2 games in back
of the Dodgers. Murry Dickson, a loser to the Giants yesterday, is brilliant
in relief in the lidlifter, coming in for La Palme in the 3rd inning with
the bases loaded and no outs. He blanks the Giants on 3 hits. The Pirates
race to a 10-1 lead in game 2, then watch the Giants score 7 runs in the
6th inning. The game is then called on account of darkness.

1953
Ted Williams is back in a Red Sox uniform after military duty in Korea. He
pinch-hits for Tom Umphlett in the bottom of the 9th and pops up. But
he will finish with 13 homers in just 91 at-bats - a record - and a .407
mark. The Browns win, 8-7, in the 10th on Bobby Young's HR.

At St. Louis, Harvey Haddix holds the Phils hitless for 8 innings before
Richie Ashburn singles in the 9th. It is the 2nd time in 6 days he's
spoiled a no-hit bid. Ennis also singles as Haddix ends with a 2-hit 2-0
win against Simmons.

1954
The Reds knock Antonelli out of the box in the 4th and hand the ace his
first loss after 11 straight wins. The Giants lose, 6-5.

1955
Scoring 6 runs in the 3rd inning on homers by Dave Philley and Gus Triandos,
the lowly Orioles defeat the league-leading White Sox, 8-1. It's Chicago's
4th straight defeat. Chicago stays in first by .001 as the Yanks and Indians
lose. After playing 274 straight games at 2B, Nellie Fox is given a day off
by White Sox manager Marty Marion. Fox will come back the next day and play
in 798 consecutive games.

1956
Yankee rookie Ralph Terry makes his ML debut at Fenway and picks up his
first win with 6 innings of work. He leaves after giving up a homer to
Piersall but 2 relievers save the 4-3 win. Brewer takes the loss. Terry is
the last Yank rookie starter to debut at Fenway this century ... New York's
Bob Meyer makes his debut at Fenway as a reliever in 1964.

1957
At St. Louis, Bob Rush wins his 2nd game against 12 losses, as the Cubs
beat the Cards, 8-2, to knock them out of first place. Rush allows 6 hits,
including a HR by Musial to beat former teammate Sam Jones. Chicago will
win the next 2 in St. Louis to dent the Cards' pennant hopes.

1959
White Sox lefty Billy Pierce and the Orioles P Billy O'Dell are even up 1-1
when Hoyt Wilhelm relieves in the 9th for Baltimore. Wilhelm tosses 8 2/3
innings of no-hit ball before allowing a safety. After 18 innings and the
score still at 1-1, the game is mercifully called because of the midnight
curfew. Pierce goes 16 innings before he gets relief from Turk Lown.

1961
Maury Wills' first HR in 1,167 ML at-bats and a double, triple and HR by
Frank Howard give the Dodgers an 11-4 win against Chicago and first place
by a half-game in the NL. Wills has 3 hits and scores 4 runs, while Podres
gives up ten hits, but goes the distance to win. Wally Moon drives in 3
runs with 3 hits.

Mantle leads the Yankees to a doubleheader sweep of the Twins, going 5 for 9
with 3 homeruns and a double. His 4 RBIs gives him an even 100 for the year
and his homer total is now 43. In the opener, Mantle had 2 homeruns off his
favorite pitcher Pedro Ramos, but it is Johnny Blanchard's homer in the 10th
that ties the game at 6-6. In the 15th, Berra hits a bases loaded grounder
and just beats the throw to first to give the Yanks the win. The Yankees
win the nitecap by a run as well, when Clete Boyer drives in Mantle in the
9th inning to break a 2-2 tie. New York now leads Detroit by 2 1/2 games.

1962
For the fifth time, a team record, Willie Mays collects five hits in a
game. In the 9-2 Giants victory over Philadelphia at Candlestick Park,

Mickey Lolich but Detroit tops the visiting Yankees, 5-4. New York will
win tomorrow and Mick will add another homer.

1967
Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson hits into his fourth career triple
play setting a major league record. The fifth inning around-the-horn triple
killing (5-4-3, Boyer-Buford-McCraw) doesn't hurt the club as the Birds beat
the White Sox at Memorial Stadium, 4-0, to complete a sweep of a twin bill.

Minnesota's Dean Chance throws a perfect no-hitter for 5 innings against
the Red Sox before the game is called. Chance wins 2-0.

1970
For the second and last time in his career, Lou Brock steals home, teaming
up with Joe Hague in a double steal in the 1st inning against the Mets in
St. Louis. Nels Briles wins, 3-0, stopping Tom Seaver's 9-game win streak.

At Minnesota, George Mitterwald leads off the bottom of the 14th with a HR

and his consecutive scoreless inning streak of 23.

1972
Hank Aaron hits his 660th and 661st HRs for the Braves, the most ever hit
by one player for the same franchise. Ruth had 659 with the Yankees, 49
with the Red Sox and 6 with the Braves. Hank's 2nd circuit blast comes in
the 10th inning off Don Gullett to beat the Reds, 4-3. Phil Niekro evens
his record at 10-10. Phil will go 6-0 against the Reds this year.

1973
Roberto Clemente and Warren Spahn head the list of new inductees at
Cooperstown. Clemente is the first Latin-born player to achieve membership
at Cooperstown. The plaque for Spahn, the winningest lefty of all time, will
credit him with 2853 strikeouts; the correct total is 2583. The incorrect
plaque will stay up for decades. The Rangers beat the Pirates in the Hall
of Fame game, 6-4.

In Milwaukee, an exhibition game between the Brewers and the Atlanta Braves
draws 33,337. The Brewers win, 7-5, in the 4th and last exhibition between
the two teams. But the big thrill is provided by Hank Aaron who homers.

1974
In Los Angeles, Johnny Bench snaps a 3-3 tie with a 2-run homer in the 10th

a three-run homerun and wins the game with a two-run single in 9th inning.

The Rangers blast the Padres, 12-5, in the Hall of Fame game featuring a
record 9 HRs.

1981
As a result of the nearly 2-month interruption in play because of the
strike the ML owners elect to split the 1981 season into 2 halves, with
the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a wild-card team
if the same club wins both halves) meeting in a best-of-five divisional
playoff series. The last time the major leagues played a split season
was 1892. The A's, Yankees, Phillies and Dodgers suddenly find themselves
guaranteed playoff spots as first-half champions.

NL owners agree to the $20.5 million sale of the Cubs to the Tribune
Company. In three weeks, Cubs stockholders - led by Bill Wrigley with 81
percent - will approve the sale.

1982
The Yankees trade 1978 play-off hero Bucky Dent to the Rangers for
outfielder/first baseman Lee Mazzilli. In spite of hitting just .169 and
losing his starting job to Roy Smalley, the popular Yankee infielder nearly
was elected to the All-Star game by the fans.

the same season.

1983
Eric Rasmussen throws a 4-0 shutout against the Red Sox in his first American

in his first-ever major league game in 1975 becomes the first pitcher to
toss a shutout in both his National League and American League debuts.

strike. But unlike the 50-day strike that interrupted the 1981 season, this

made up. The new collective bargaining agreement, which runs through 1989,
raises the ML minimum salary to $60,000, extends the time of service required
to be eligible for salary arbitration from 2 years to 3, and eliminates the
free-agent compensation pool that resulted from the 1981 strike settlement.

for his 30th as Oakland beats the Mariners, 5-4.

In remembrance of the fond memories of its departed ball club and the many
historical events which took place place in the ballpark they called home,
a plaque is dedicated behind home plate of the former Braves Field. Done
on behalf of the fans of New England by Boston University, the Society For
American Baseball Research, and the New England Sports Museum, the tablet

joining Joe Cronin (4), Bobby Doerr (1) and Ted Williams (9), to be honored
by having his uniform number retired by the club. In today's game, Roger
Clemens then retires just one batter before leaving, giving up 3 earned
runs. But Boston scores 4 in the 3rd and 2 in the 8th to beat Cleveland, 6-4.

After 5 hours 49 minutes of play in Pittsburgh, the Pirates' Jeff King

2001
The Hall of Fame Veterans Committee comprised of five former players, five
media members and five former executives, which was established in 1953,
is to be replaced by a 90-member group made up of the members of the Hall of
Fame (61), the recipients of the J.G. Taylor Spink award for writers (13),
the Ford C. Frick award for broadcasters (13) and current Veterans Committee
members (3). The new committee will be able to elect players only once every
two years and executives, umpires and managers only once every four years. It
gives new hope to 1,700 players who had failed to receive at least 5 percent
of the votes cast by the writers. The new rules will likely make it more
difficult for Negro League and pre-1900 players to be enshrined, and also
will make it tougher for players not elected by the writers to be enshrined.
