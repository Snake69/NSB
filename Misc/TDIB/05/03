May 3

1901
In a matchup of future Hall of Famers the Giants beat Boston, 2-1, as Christy
Mathewson wins his 3rd straight, beating Kid Nichols, on a 3-hitter. Bobby
Lowe, who has all of Boston's hits, scores the Beaneater's only run on a
passed ball.

1904
The Chicago Cubs beat the Pirates, 15-3, as Davy Jones scores 5 runs.

1905
After a 5-4 win over the Athletics, Washington leads the AL, the highest
position it has attained in any race since 1893. In 3 days it will be
supplanted by the Cleveland Naps (formerly the Blues).

After a 5-4 win versus visting Pittsburgh, the Cardinals fire Kid Nichols
as manager. Nichols guided St. Louis to a 5th place finish last year and
they were 5-9 under him this season. Nichols will sign with the Phillies
as a pitcher, while Jimmy Burke will take over as manager for the next 90
games before he too will be let go.

1907
Dilatory tactics of the Highlanders' Judd Doyle, whose well-earned nickname
is "Slow Joe", lengthens a 10-inning game with the Athletics to a record
3 hours 7 minutes. New York wins, 4-3.

At the Polo Grounds, Brooklyn's Elmer Stricklett allows just 3 Giant hits
but Christy Mathewson goes one better, and the Giants win, 1-0.

1909
The Pirates top Chicago, 9-2, as Wagner again steals 3 bases, including
home. Wagner, who was 5 for 6 yesterday, duplicates that today.

In a 7-1 Boston win over Washington, Tris Speaker hits his first ML homer,
off Dolly Gray.

1912
Leading 18-5 after 8 innings, A's pitchers give up a since-tied record
9th-inning outburst of 10 runs to New York before Eddie Plank stops them
at 18-15.

Despite a 9th inning triple steal, the Giants lose to the Phils, 8-6, in 10
innings, called by the New York Times:  "the triple steal business is about
as scarce in the National Pastime as whip sockets on an automobile." New
York overcomes a 5-0 deficit to tie on the triple theft; Merkle's 4th hit,
a Texas leaguer by Herzog and a walk to Meyers sets up the thievery. Reliever
Christy Mathewson is drilled for 3 doubles and the loss, while Pete Alexander
gets the win. Bill Klem sets a season high mark when he tosses 4 players,
including McGraw, out of the game.

In a U.S. League game at the Bronx Oval, the Reading team beats the Bronxites
13-8 as just 250 fans look on.

1913
The Phillies whip the visiting Giants for the 3rd time in a row, a
come-from-behind 3-2 victory. The Phils tie the score at 2 apiece when Gavvy
Cravath clouts a 2-run pinch homer in the 8th off Christy Mathewson. After
the first two batters are retired in the 9th, the Quakers push across a
run to win. The struggling Giants are in 5th place.

1915
Yankee pitcher Ray Fisher steals home in the 4th inning as New York doubles
the A's, 8-4.

1920
Two days after Boston and Brooklyn battled to a 20-inning 1-1 tie, they
go at it again for 19 innings in Boston this time. Boston prevails in the
bottom of the 19th, 2-1, by bunching three singles. Dana Fillingham scatter
12 hits for a complete game 19-inning win, while starter Sherrod Smith allows
13 in a losing effort. Brooklyn has played 58 innings in their past 3 games.

The Cubs sweep a pair from the Reds, 2-1 and 5-0. Hippo Vaughn is the winner
in the opener and drives in both runs. In the 2nd game, Grover Alexander
continues his wins streak by shutting out the Reds, 5-0, and beating Ray
Fisher. Fisher will finish the year at 14-5. Alex pitches a six hitter and
Dave Robertson homers.

The Tigers finally win their first game, tripping the Indians, 5-1, behind
Dutch Leonard's 5-hitter.

1923
Pirates 1B Charlie Grimm starts a 25-game hitting streak that will be stopped
by Dick Rudolph, the 1914 Braves hero, who comes off the coaching lines to
make 4 starts for Boston.

1926
The Reds pull off a triple steal against the Cards with Sammy Bohne,
Val Picinich and Walt Christensen doing the swiping. Cincy wins, 9-6,
with Eppa Rixey getting the victory.

1927
In the first matchup of pitching brothers in ML history, Brooklyn's Jess
Barnes defeats his brother Virgil, 7-6. In relief of McWeeny, Jess pitches

allows 12 hits in the first 7 2/3 innings, and takes the loss.

1928
Ty Cobb hits the 700th double of his career while his Athletics lose to
the Red Sox, 3-1.

1931
Hollywood (PCL) spitballer Frank Shellenback loses a 2-0 decision to Seattle

15-game win streak in his next outing on May 10th, helping his cause with
a grand slam.

1932
The A's take the 2nd of the 2-game set at Fenway, beating the Red Sox, 6-1,
behind George Earnshaw. Al Simmons hits a 3-run HR in the 9th to clinch it.

1936
After being sidelined at the start of the season because of a foot injury,
Joe DiMaggio makes his much anticipated major league debut. Playing LF, the
21-year-old has 3 hits, one a triple, as New York routs St. Louis 14-5. Joe
scores 3 runs and knocks in one. Gehrig and Ben Chapman each collect 4
hits and Gehrig scores 5 runs. New York will win 5 of their next 6 games
with DiMag in the lineup. To make room, the Yankees waive OF Dixie Walker,
hitting .350, to the White Sox.

1937
The Giants equal a ML record, playing a 9-inning game against the Boston
Bees with no chances for their outfielders. The Bees' gardeners have just
3 chances in winning, 3-1.

1938
Lefty Grove defeats the Tigers, 4-3, in 10 innings for the first of a record
20 consecutive victories at his home field, Fenway Park in Boston. He will
not lose there until May 12, 1941.

1939
In an 11-11 tie with the Browns, Washington 1B Jimmy Wasdell makes 4 errors
to equal the ML mark.

1941
In his first major league start, Cardinal rookie Henry Gornicki throws
a one-hitter beating Philadelphia at Shibe Park, 6-1. The 30-year-old
right-hander, who will win only fifteen games in his career, gives up the lone
hit to rookie outfielder Stanley Benjamin. It is the Cards' 8th straight win.

1942
The Tigers edge the A's, 8-7, in game 1 of a twinbill. Rudy York, who clouted
2 homers yesterday, hits 2 more in the opener, one short of Cobb's AL record
for 2 straight games. Phil Marchildon allows 2 hits in game 2 to stop the
Tigers, 1-0.

The Giants score 5 runs in the first two innings against the host Reds,
then hang on as Cincinnati scores 3 runs in the 9th. New York wins, 5-4.
Reds rookie Hank Sauer, listed at 23 (born March 17, 1919), hits his first
ML homer. Decades later his birth year will be corrected to 1917, relieving
his younger/older brother Ed who was born in January 1919.

1944
Joe Cronin, making his 1944 debut at 1B, makes putouts at both ends of
a double play, one out at 1B and the other at 3B. The Sox make 4 DPs and
collect 15 hits in beating the Senators, 11-10. Stan Spence and Bobby Doerr
each hit a HR, double and single. The Nats have 16 hits in the loss.

1947
In a controversial move, Branch Rickey trades five Dodgers - pitchers Kirby
Higby, Hank Behrman, Cal McLish, and minor leaguers Gene Mauch and C Dixie
Howell - to the Pirates for Al Gionfriddo and $100,000. Some believe 'the
Mahatma' made the deal to send a message to the team about his commitment
to breaking the color barrier and his support of Jackie Robinson, the
first black to play in the major leagues this century. Behrman, with no
appearances for Brooklyn this year will go 0-2 before the Bucs send him
back to Brooklyn on June 14.

The Cards trade CF Harry Walker and right-hander Freddy Schmidt to the
Phillies for OF Ron Northey. Although batting only .200 with the Cards,
'Harry the Hat' Walker will hit .371 for the Phils in 130 games to finish
the season with a league-leading .363 batting average.

1949
Taking advantage of the shortened fence installed by White Sox GM Frank
Lane, the Senators belt 7 homers - and need them all - in beating Chicago,
14-12, in 10 innings. This is only time a team has collected 7 homers in an
extra inning contest. Clyde Vollmer leads the hit parade with 2, followed
by Christman, Coan, Evans, Eddie Robinson and Stewart. The Sox get homers
from Joe Tipton and Gus Zernial.

1950
Yankee Vic Raschi, troubled by the new rule that requires a one-second
stop before delivery with men on base, balks 4 times in one game, a club
record and 2 fewer than the single-season record. Nevertheless, he wins,
4-3, over the White Sox. He'll finish the season with 6 balks to tie the
since-topped AL mark.

1951
In St. Louis, Gil McDougald hits a grand slam (his first career homer)
and a triple in the 9th, as the Yanks score 11 runs in the inning to rout
St. Louis, 17-3. McDougald, destined to be Rookie of the Year, racks up
6 RBIs in the frame tieing a major league record. Jackie Jensen follows
McDougald's triple with one of his own, then homers after Gil's grand
slam. Allie Reynolds is the winner.

1952
The Red Sox beat the Browns 5-2 in Fenway though odd occurrences interrupt
the game. In the bottom of the first, 2 fraternity boys dressed in baseball
uniforms run onto the field and start throwing a rubber ball around. Two
innings later a one-legged man on crutches jumps onto the field to talk to
Browns SS Marty Marion and P Earl Harrist. He then shakes hands with Red
Sox base runner Don Lenhardt before being hurried off the field.

The Indians lose, but go down swinging as they use a record 23 players
including the first black battery in the AL. 39-year-old Negro League
veteran Quincy Troupe is behind the plate when reliever Sam Jones comes
in. Bob Chakales loses it for the Tribe with 2 outs in the 9th. Jones and
Troupe are the battery tomorrow as Jones will pick up a 9-6 win against
the Red Sox in relief.

In an effort to fill the void in center field created by Joe DiMaggio's
retirement and Mickey Mantle's recovery from last season's knee surgery,
the New York Yankees send promising reserve outfielder Jackie Jensen, along
with OF Archie Wilson, P Spec Shea, and SS Jerry Snyder to the Senators for
slick-fielding OF Irv Noren and infielder Tommie Upton. Shea will have two
fine seasons on the hill before going over it, while Jensen, the former
heir to DiMaggio's spot, will eventually emerge as a star with the Red
Sox. Noren will have his best year in 1954, when the left fielder will be an
all-star. In 1958, Jensen will win the American League MVP playing for Boston.

1953
Johnny Lindell, the converted outfielder, pitches the Pirates to their 5th
straight win, beating the Cards, 6-2. Lindell drives in the 4th run with
a double to beat Harvey Haddix and earn his first win since 1942.

1954
Sandy Consuegra gives up 3 runs on just two hits as the White Sox pound
the A's, 14-3. The Sox pitchers have given up 5 hits in the last 3 games.

1955
Mantle's homer in the 6th off Mike Garcia gives New York a 4-3 lead, but
Cleveland wins it 5-4 at home. Garcia last year allowed just six homers in
258 innings, the best mark of the 1950s.

1956
Before 4,308 at the Stadium, Mantle homers for the 3rd day in a row, but
Kansas City holds on to win, 8-7. Mick's homer in the 5th is followed by
homers by Bauer and Berra.

1957
At Jersey City, Brooklyn's Don Newcombe shuts out the Cards, 6-0, for his
9th straight win over St. Louis stretching back to 1951.

Giants, 11-10

1959
At Briggs Stadium, Charlie Maxwell hits four straight homeruns in a
doubleheader helping the 2-15 Tigers, under new manager Jimmy Dykes,
sweep the Yankees 4-2 and 8-2. Maxwell is 2-4 in the opener, with a 9th
inning homer, then homers his first three at-bats in game 2. It was Dykes'
first day as skipper and he put Charlie back in the line-up even though
'Ole Paw Paw' was hitting only .136 at the time.

C Hank Foiles of Pittsburgh makes an unassisted DP in a 2-1 loss to St. Louis.

At Crosley Field, Jerry Lynch cracks a 3-run homer in the bottom of the
9th and the Reds top the Dodgers, 6-3.

1961
Another brilliant Warren Spahn performance is spoiled when LF Mel Roach's
misplay costs the Milwaukee ace a 2nd no-hitter in a row. He settles for
a 2-hitter in topping the Dodgers 4-1.

In an International League game at Toronto, the home town Maple Leafs score
10 runs in the 8th inning to win 15-3. Leaf switch hitter Ellis Burton
homers twice in the big inning, once from each side of the plate. His 2nd
homer is a grand slam over the RF fence. Teammate Sparky Anderson scored
on both HRs after reaching base on walks.

1963
In his 1st and only at-bat as an Oriole, pitcher Les "Buster" Narum homers
against Detroit's Don Mossi. Six days later, the 22-year-old rookie is
optioned to Rochester but will return to the majors next year with Washington
where he'll hit two more. Narum is the first pitcher to have more homers
than wins in a season, but he'll be matched on September 2 by Ed Hobaugh,
and in 1992 by Dave Eiland.

The Reds Pete Rose hits his first ML homer, connecting off Cards ace Ernie
Broglio, in a 6-0 win for the Reds.

1964
Reliever John Wyatt picks up two wins for the A's in a sweep of the
Twins. Wyatt totals 3 2/3 innings of work.

belts a 3-run homer and Hal Smith adds a 2-run pinch single in the 8th for
a 6-5 Reds win.

Sadaharu Oh of the Yomiuri Giants hits 4 HRs in one 9-inning game against

shutout and blanks the Yanks 1-0.

1971
The Toei Flyers set a Japan League record of 5 HRs in one inning, tying the
American record held by several teams, most recently the Minnesota Twins
in 1966. The record will be tied in 1977 and 1980, and finally broken in 1986.

1972
For the second straight day the Cubs whomp the Braves, 12-1. Jose Cardenal
leads the attack with a triple, double and 2 singles. Fergie Jenkins is
the easy winner as Jack Billingham loses his 4th straight.

1975
The Reds switch Pete Rose from left field to 3B, opening a lineup spot for
utility OF George Foster. Over the next 4 seasons, Foster will average 36
HRs, 117 RBI and a .302 BA, helping the Reds to two World Championships. Gary
Nolan, making a comeback after shoulder problems sidelined him in 1973-74,
stops the Braves, 6-1. It is Nolan's first win since October 3, 1972 when
he beat the Astros by an identical score in Cincinnati.

1979
In a 6-1 defeat to the Brewers, Indian outfielder Bobby Bonds hits his 300th
homerun off Moose Haas to become only the second player in major league
history to steal at least 300 bases (413) and hit 300 round trippers. Willie
Mays was the first to accomplish the feat (July 4, 1961).

1980
Rangers pitcher Ferguson Jenkins defeats the Orioles 3-2 to become only
the 4th pitcher to win 100 games in each league. He won 149 games for the
Phillies and Cubs before joining the AL in 1974. The other 3 pitchers are
Jim Bunning, Gaylord Perry and Cy Young.

Orioles 4-2. It is their first win in Baltimore since July of 1978.

1982
Facing the minimum 27 batters, Mike Flanagan and the Orioles beat Seattle,
6-0. The Baltimore right-hander gives up three hits and a walk, but two double
plays, a pickoff and a caught stealing attempt deprives the opposition of
any men left on base.

1983
After returning from a stint on the disabled list, Dave Wilhelmi of the
Shrevport Captains throws a perfect game beating the Arkansas Travelers
in Little Rock, 7-0. It takes two spectacular ninth inning catches in the
outfield to complete the second perfecto in Texas League history.

1984
Bobby Ojeda strikes out a career-high 10 batters and outduels Jack Morris
as the Red Sox beat the Tigers 1-0, handing Detroit (19-4) a 2nd consecutive
loss.

Kansas City's first two hitters - Daryl Motley and Pat Sheridan - reach

6-5, in 10 innings. Reliever Tom Tellmann wins when Mark Brouhard strokes
a bases-loaded single.

1986
Don Mattingly connects for three sacrifice flies in a 9-4 win over the
Rangers. The Yankee first baseman is only the sixth player to accomplish
this feat.

Minnesota's Kirby Puckett hits a homerun on the game's first pitch (from

Cubs 3B Ron Cey hits his 300th and 301st homeruns and Chicago scores 4
times in the top of the 9th to beat San Francisco 6-5.

It's not the baseball that stinks today. A skunk wanders onto the field
in the 7th inning at Jack Murphy Stadium and holds up the Padres-Pirates
game for 7 minutes. The incident gives life to the rumor that a group of
skunks live under the stadium, existing on peanuts and other food dropped
by fans. The Bucs score 3 in the 8th and 1 in the 9th to beat the Padres, 7-6.

1987
Joe Crowley, pitching in relief, makes his final major league appearance
giving up three runs in two-thirds of an inning in the Phillies' 9-6 loss
to Cincinnati. The 28-year-old becomes the only pitcher in major league
history never to win another game after pitching a no-hitter, a feat he
accomplished last season against the White Sox as a starter with the Angels.

Eric Davis belts 3 consecutive homeruns, including a grand slam, to lead
Cincinnati to a 9-6 win at Philadelphia. Davis was the last NL player to

by committing 4 errors at 3B in the Yankees' 10-5 loss to the Indians.

hits 2 of them, and is ejected from the game by home plate umpire Jim Quick.

At Denver, Ray Lankford leads off for St. Louis with his 2nd leadoff homer
in two games, but that is all the Cards scoring. Colorado then plates 10
runs to win, 10-1.

Florida OF Chuck Carr records the first 5-hit game in Marlins history,
doing so in the team's 6-3 win over the Braves. Carr's 5 singles helps
Florida move 2 games over .500 for the first time in their 2-year history.

1995
David Bell makes his ML debut at 3B in the Indians' 14-7 win over the
Tigers. His appearance makes the Bells - with his father Buddy and his
grandfather Gus - the second three-generation family in ML history (the
Boones are the first). Gus Bell will pass away in 4 days.

1996
Ranger P Ken Hill gives up a 1st-inning infield single to Bobby Higginson,

1998
Mariners C Dan Wilson becomes just the 7th backstop in major league history

a first for the Mariners and the first in the AL since Mike Greenwell did
it on September 1, 1990.

The Orioles' Mike Mussina shuts out the Twins, 2-0, for his 11 straight
win over the Twins. Palmeiro and Davis homer for the scoring.

After pitching to 2 batters yesterday, Braves closer Mark Wohlers had
to leave the game and is put on the DL because of a torn muscle in his
side. Coming off the DL, his control will disappear and he will split his
time between Richmond (AAA) and the Braves. With Atlanta, Wohlers will walk
15 and allow 13 runs in just 4 1/3 innings.

1999
Boston blows a 7-0 lead in a 12-11 10-inning loss to the A's. Red Sox rookie
Creighton Gubanich becomes only the fourth player to hit a grand slam for
his first major league hit. The reserve catcher joins Bill Duggleby (1898 -
Phillies), Bobby Bonds (1968 - Giants) and Orlando Mercado (1982 -Mariners)
in accomplishing the feat.

The Pirates score 4 runs in the bottom of the 9th to defeat the Giants,
9-8. Jeff Kent gets 5 hits for the Giants, and hits for the cycle, just
the 2nd player to do so in Three Rivers Stadium. Joe Torre did it on June
27, 1973. Jason Kendall goes 5 for 5, with 2 doubles, in a losing cause
for Pittsburgh.

The Blue Jays outslug the Mariners, 16-10. Carlos Delgado goes 3 for 3 for
Toronto, with 2 HRs, 5 runs scored and 5 RBIs.

For the first time, Cuba faces major league competition in the United
States. In the 2nd game of their home-and-home series, the Cuban All-Star
team handily defeats the Baltimore Orioles, 12-6, in the exhibition game
played in Baltimore. Afterwards, Cuban pitching coach Rigoberto Herrera
requests asylum in the U.S.

Tigers P Brian Moehler is suspended for 10 games for scuffing the ball 2
days ago. Moehler denies having sandpaper attached to his thumb and instead
says it was dirt. But Moehler says he won't appeal.

appearance. Wohlers walks 5 out of the 7 batters he faces and fires 4 wild
pitches in 1/3 IP.

2000

The Major League Baseball Players Association again denies several
major-leaguers admission to the union. The players crossed picket lines
during the 1994-95 strike becoming replacement players. These players don't
pay union dues, receive full pension benefits, and can use the Association's
grievance procedure. However, they do not receive a share of royalties
from the sale of baseball merchandise. Historian Stuart Shea notes the
players are the only ex-replacements currently on major-league rosters:
Benny Agbayani and Rick Reed, Mets; Trinidad Hubbard, Kerry Ligtenberg
and Keith Lockhart, Braves; Cory Lidle and Damien Miller, Diamondbacks;
Keith Osik and Rich Loiselle, Pirates; Matt Herges, Dodgers; Joe Slusarski,
Astros; Shane Spencer, Yankees; Jeff Tam, A's; and Donne Wall, Padres.

2001
Johnny Oates resigns as the Ranger manager and will be replaced by the
team's third base coach Jerry Narron. A poor start of 11-17 due to a lack
of pitching, and owner Tom Hicks' high expectations after signing prized
free agent Alex Rodriquez, had led to the speculation the Texas skipper
would soon be fired.

Michael Orschlin, the third fan to jump onto the field at Kauffman Stadium
this season, is taken away on a stretcher during the ninth inning of a
Royals' loss as a result of broken foot. The 22-year-old, trying to win a
$400 wager from a friend, will face $1,000 fine for trespassing.

2002
The Braves defeat the Cardinals, 2-1, on Chipper Jones' 2-run HR in the
11th inning. Braves' starter, rookie Damian Moss, hurls 7 hitless innings
for Atlanta, walking 7 and striking out 6. He leaves for a pinch-hitter in
the 8th with the game scoreless.

Peoria's Tyler Johnson loses a no-hitter when Michigan's Brooks Conrad is
credited with a single when his batted ball hits baserunner Kerry Hodges,
who had walked with two out in the 8th inning.

2004
Similar to last season, the aging outfielder Rickey Henderson re-signs
with the Atlantic League's Bears hoping for a shot of returning to the big
leagues. The 45-year-old future Hall of Fame batted .339, hit eight homeruns,
drove in 33 runs, scored 52 runs and stole nine bases for the Newark team
last season before joining the Dodgers in July.

2005
With a 9-0 margin, a state legislative committee votes to approve a bill
which will require the Los Angeles Angels, formerly known as the Anaheim
Angels, to disclose on all promotional material, including tickets, ads
and team publications that the team is based in Anaheim. Using the example
of an orange juice company selling OJ that contains no oranges, California
Assemblyman Tom Umberg, the bill's sponsor, says he is trying to promote
truth in sports advertising.

The White Sox, with the best record in the majors, establish a big league
record having led in all 28 games played to this point in the season.

2006
Major League Baseball will sell the Nationals to a group led by Theodore
Lerner, a Maryland-based real estate developer, for $450 million. In
2002, the 29 other big league owners collectively bought the Montreal
Expos franchise for $120 million, and then moved the failing franchise to
Washington, D.C. last season.

2008
With his three-run blast at Chase Field off Diamondbacks ace Brandon Webb,
Carlos Delgado moves ahead of Juan Gonzalez as the homerun leader for
players born in Puerto Rico. The struggling Mets first baseman's 435th career
homerun places the Aguadilla native 36th on the all-time major league list.

2009
Defeating San Diego 2-1 in 10 innings, the Dodgers tie a franchise record
winning their ninth consecutive decision at home from the start of the
season. The 1946 club also reeled off nine straight victories at Brooklyn's
Ebbets Field at the beginning of the post-war campaign.

In the eighth inning of the the Rays' 5-3 victory over Boston, Carl Crawford
steals his sixth base of the game to become the fourth major leaguer to
accomplish the feat. The 27-year-old perennial American League stolen base
champ joins Eddie Collins (twice in 1912 - A's), Otis Nixon (Braves - 1991)
and Eric Young (Rockies - 1996) as the only players to pilfer a half dozen
bags in a contest since 1900.

2011
Francisco Liriano's first complete game in his six-year major league career is
a no-hitter, a 1-0 gem thrown against the White Sox at a chilly U.S. Cellular
Field. The Twins' 27-year-old southpaw entered the game with a 2-4 record
along with a 9.13 ERA fueling speculation that he was in danger of losing
his spot in the Minnesota rotation.

2014
The Mets set the record for the longest hitless streak by a major league
pitching staff to start a season when Jenrry Mejia grounds out to second,
making the New York hurlers, collectively, 0 for 46 since Opening Day. The
dubious mark, previously established by the 1914 St. Louis Browns, will
be extended to 64 at-bats before Jacob deGrom, in his first major league
at-bat, singles off Yankee right-hander Chase Whitley.

2015
The Nationals blank the Mets at Citi Field, 1-0, on consecutive days,
marking the first time in 19 years that a road opponent has recorded 1-0
victories against the same team on back-to-back days. The Cardinals last
accomplished the feat in 1996 when they held Phillies scoreless, scoring
lone runs in the April 19 and 20th contests at Veterans Stadium.

2017
Aaron Judge of the Yankees became the youngest player in Major League
history to hit 13 homeruns in his team's first 26 games with his homerun
against the Toronto Blue Jays.

The Arizona Diamondbacks set a Major League record by recording nine
consecutive games where Arizona pitchers recorded ten or more strikeouts
starting April 24. The Diamondbacks recorded their strikeouts during a
four-game set with the San Diego Padres, followed by three games against
the Colorado Rockies, and the first two games of a three-game set against
the Washington Nationals. Fourteen different Diamondbacks pitchers recorded
a total of 113 strikeouts over the nine game period.
