May 11

1901
The largest NL crowd of the year so far (8,500) fills Brooklyn's Washington
Park to view the Boy Wonder from Bucknell, Christy Mathewson. Matty doesn't
disappoint, topping Brooklyn's William Kennedy, 7-0, as Brooklyn manages
just 2 hits off the Giants budding star. New York moves into 3rd place with
the win.

1904
Against Detroit, Cy Young pitches no-hit ball until the 7th inning, when Sam
Crawford hits a one-out single to break his consecutive streak of no hit
innings at 24 1/3 (76 batters without a hit) still the record (for years,
the record book had Young at 23 1/3 innings arguing his relief of Winters
occurred with men on base). Young and Tiger starter Ed Killian battle
for 15 innings before Boston finally scores a run to win 1-0. Young will
throw 45 shutout innings in a row, a record broken by Don Drysdale's 58 in
1968. Young's no-hit streak includes a perfect game against the A's on May 5.

In the opener of a 4-game series with the visiting Cleveland Blues, the
New York Highlanders prevail, 4-2, on a 2-run HR by Kid Elberfeld and a
pair of run-scoring singles by Deacon McGuire. The New Yorkers will take
3 of the 4 games to move into a tie 2nd place.

1905
Christy Mathewson strikes out the side in the first inning and whitewashes
the Cardinals, 4-0, on 5 hits. Jack Taylor takes the loss for St. Louis.

In Brooklyn, the Superbas attempt to change their bad luck by batting first
against the Reds and take advantage of hitting a clean ball. "We like the new
ball," observes manager Ned Hanlon. The Reds win it in the bottom of the 10th
- an unusual occurrence - when Admrial Schlei hits a RBI single. Undaunted,
Brooklyn will bat first tomorrow and beat the Reds, 2-1.

1906
Tom Jones, St. Louis Browns 1B, has 22 putouts - an AL record that will
be tied by the Highlanders' Hal Chase on September 21, and not again until
July 20, 1987, by Don Mattingly. His Browns beat Boston, 8-3.

1907
John McGraw deals three aces today against the Pirates, and emerges with a
9-6 win. Starter Joe McGinnity lasts one inning, Hooks Wiltse pitches until
the 7th when he is given the hook in favor of Christy Mathewson. The Giants
score 4 runs in the bottom of the 7th off Mike Lynch with the victory going
to Matty.

1908
In Pittsburgh, Honus Wagner leads the Pirates to a 5-2 win over the Giants
with a triple, 2 walks, 2 runs and 2 RBI. His delayed break to 2nd allows
Fred Clarke to score the 5th run on the front end of a double steal.

1911
Against a coasting Grover Alexander, the Pirates rally for 6 hits and 7
runs in the 9th inning, but fall far short as the Phillies win, 19-10. Honus
Wagner is 1 for 2 before being tossed by umpire Bill Finneran.

The White Sox pound Senator pitcher Bob Groom for 20 hits and 20 runs to
win, 20-6.

The Red Sox sell Frank Smith to Cincinnati. Smith was a 25-game winner in
1909 with the White Sox, but fell to 5-11 last year. He'll go 10-14 with
the Reds this year.

Kansas City's Homer Smoot is 6 for 6 in an AA game against St. Paul.

1912
In an 8-1 win at Boston, Browns 1B George Stovall nabs Les Nunamaker in
the 5th inning with a hidden ball trick.

1915
Jim Kelly of the PittFeds hits the first pitch for a leadoff homer and the
game's only score. Buffalo's Fred Anderson serves up the homer and takes
the loss.

1917
In Detroit, the Red Sox win 2-1 behind Babe Ruth. Ty Cobb leads off Detroit's
9th with a bunt single, and when the next batter grounds out to 3B, Cobb
rounds 2B and continues towards third. Ruth, covering 3B, takes the throw
and tags out Cobb so viciously that the star is on the ground for two minutes.

At Washington, Walter Johnson gives up a bases-loaded double to Cleveland's
Bobby Roth and the Indians beat the Senators, 4-3. It is the first bases
loaded hit to clear the sacks off Johnson.

In a 9-2 loss to the Giants, the Reds' Jim Thorpe hits an inside-the-park
homer against his old teammates.

1918
The A's Scott Perry holds the White Sox to one hit, a single by Swede
Risberg, in besting fellow rookie Frank Shellenback, 1-0. The A's score in
the 8th. Chicago's Red Faber will repay Perry in 3 days, when he pitches
a 3-hit shutout to win, 3-0.

1919
Hod Eller throws a no-hitter defeating St. Louis, 6-0. The Reds' right-hander,
who is the ace of the eventual world champs, strikes out eight Cardinals
on a cold day at Cincinnati's Redland Field.

In the first legal Sunday game in New York for the Yankees, and after a 12
inning duel between Washington's Walter Johnson and New York spitballer
Jack Quinn, neither team score. The Big Train allows a single in the
first and then retires the next 28 batters before giving up a walk in the
10th. Future football immortal George Halas, batting leadoff for New York,
goes 0 for 5 with two strikeouts. In a misinterpretation of the new rules,
the game is called at 6 p.m. by New York owner Jacob Ruppert.

In cold Cincinnati, righthander Hod Eller pitches a 6-0 no-hitter over the
Cards, striking out 8. The Reds have 8 hits and 5 stolen bases off Jakie May.

1920
For the first time in 9 years, a NL player hits 3 triples in a game. Ross
Youngs does the trick, and his teammates add two more in Cincinnati, but
the Giants lose 9-4.

1922
Spitballer Bill Doak faces Shufflin' Phil Douglas at Sportsman's Park and
allows just one hit, a leadoff bunt by Dave Bancroft that eludes the pitcher
and 1B Jack Fournier. The Cards win, 2-0, over the Giants.

At Cincinnati, the Reds score 9 runs in the first three innings and roll
to a 9-5 win over the Braves. Boston stanches any more scoring in the 6th
with a triple play:  Kopf - Ford - Helke - O'Neill.

At Milwaukee a judge orders Charles Comiskey to appear in court regarding
an allegation by the lawyer for Happy Felsch that a fund was kept in 1917
to be used to buy games from opposing players. Felsch charges that one of
the teams was Detroit.

1923
The Phils and Cards bash a record 10 HRs out of cozy Baker Bowl as the Phils
outkick the Cards, 20-14. Cy Williams has 3 homers and 7 RBIs while teammate
Johnny Mokan adds two homers, a double and 7 RBIs. Les Mann belts two for
St. Louis, and losing pitcher Bill Sherdel connects. In all, 23 batters
hit safely with the two teams combining for 79 total bases. Williams now
has 12 homers, tops in the Majors.

OF Pete Schneider strokes 5 HRs, including 2 grand slams, in a game for
Vernon (Pacific Coast League). He also adds a double that hits 2 feet from
the top of the CF wall. The former ML pitcher, who won 20 for the Reds in
1917, drives in 14 runs in a 35-11 victory over Salt Lake City.

1925
Walter Johnson blanks the White Sox, 9-0, for his 108th shutout, and he
runs his strikeout total to 3,232.

Chicago C Ray Schalk holds on to a ball dropped 460 feet from the top of
the Tribune Tower in Chicago.

In a Mississippi Valley League game, 55-year-old former Giants star Joe
McGinnity hurls Dubuque to a 7-3 victory over 18-year-old John Welch
of Ottumwa.

1926
The Giants sell sore-armed pitcher Art Nehf to the Reds. The fair-minded
Nehf is upset that John McGraw has not informed Reds manager Jack Hendricks
of Nehf's arm problems, and the pitcher will not speak with the Giants'
manager for years.

1927
In St. Louis, Ruth belts his 2nd homer in 2 days and his 8th of the year,
off Ernie Nevers, as the Yanks win, 4-2. The ball is to the left of the CF
flagpole in Sportsman's Park, the longest ball to date ever hit there. Martin
Haley in the St. Louis Post Dispatch writes:  "Homeric Herman careened the
animated leather for a sky-scraping bulls eye into the distant center-field
bleachers, the ball clattering up the icy seats at the point where the
left-center and dead-center field sections conjoin."

In Detroit, it is Ty Cobb Day and more than 30,000 pay to see the former
Tiger manager in his first appearance at Navin Field in an A's uniform. With
Collins on base in the first inning, Cobb drives a double into the overflow
crowd to start the A's to a 6-3 win. Lefty Grove is the victor.

1928
The Cards and Phils swap catchers, with Spud Davis going to Philley and
Jimmy Wilson to St. Louis. Wilson, the better defensive backstop, will
improve the Cards.

1929
After 25 consecutive complete games, White Sox righthander Tommy Thomas
comes out in the 5th inning of a 9-2 loss to Washington. He will still lead
the AL with 24 CG, the 3rd year in a row he'll complete that many starts.

1930
In a display of offensive symmetry, Indian OF Bibb Falk collects 5 hits,
5 RBI and scores 5 runs in the first 5 innings as the Tribe scalps the
Athletics, 25-7. Cleveland collects 27 hits, but no homers, and scores
in every inning but the 8th. The 25 runs without a homer ties a ML record
(sets a new AL mark) set in 1901 and will not be matched again.

1932
Eighth-grader Joe Schultz Jr singles, swipes two bases and scores as a
pinch-hitter in a Texas League game. The fourteen-year-old is the son of
the manager and will become a second string catcher in the major leagues.

Cardinal starter Wild Bill Hallahan lives up to his name with 3 wild pitches
in the 12th inning to hand Brooklyn a 6-3 win at St. Louis. He ties the
record set by Jake Weimer of the Cubs on May 10, 1903. Wild Bill walked 10
against the Cubs on May 1.

1933
The Browns ship catcher Rick Ferrell and pitcher Lloyd Brown to the Red Sox
for catcher Merv Shea and cash. Ferrell will hit .300 for the Sox over the
next 4 seasons, while Shea will play just a season for the Browns.

1935
White Sox rookie John Whitehead beats the Red Sox, 13-3, as Chicago regains
first place in the AL.

1936
Mel Ott drives in 8 runs, including a 3-run HR with two out in the 9th
inning, to give the Giants a 13-12 win over the Phillies.

1937
White Sox P Monte Stratton allows 7 hits in subduing the Yankees, 7-2. One
of the hits is by Tommy Henrich, who goes 1 for 4 in his ML debut. Henrich,
recently signed, was called up to take the place of Jake Powell, out with
appendicitis.

1939
The Yankees set down the Browns, 10-8, jumping on rookie Ewald Pyle for
three hits before he exits. Pyle is subbing for Newsom, out with a skinned
finger. Russ Van Atta, the Fresno Flinger follows, and the Yanks score nine
runs in four innings to put the game out of reach. Bill Dickey has three
hits to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. Gehrig does not play, but
takes infield practice and warms up Monte Pearson using a righty glove. New
York now leads by 1 1/2 games.

Ted Lyons hurls the White Sox to a 3-2 win over Boston, handing rookie
Woodrow Rich his first loss. Chicago makes just 4 hits. Jimmy Foxx hits
his 5th homer, a solo in the 9th, for Boston.

Cleveland native Al Milnar stops the visiting A's, 7-0. Ken Keltner
has a triple and three RBIs, and Roy Weatherly is 5 for 5, all singles,
for Cleveland.

The Boston Bees collect 13 hits off the Cubs 33-year-old rookie Vance Page,
but manage just 2 runs in losing 6-2. Billy Herman's bases-loaded triple
in the 9th seals it. Poor base running contributes to the loss, the worst
example coming in the 4th when Eddie Miller singles and stops at 3B on
a drive down the 1B line by Elbie Fletcher. Fletcher is caught trying to
stretch the hit to a triple.

1940
The Red Sox top the Yankees 9-8 with 2 runs in the bottom of the 11th after
New York had taken the lead on Tommy Henrich's 2nd HR of the game. Manager
Joe McCarthy benches Frankie Crosetti, hitting .150, but New York (6-8) still
loses their 8th in a row at home to drop into last place. Meanwhile, Boston
takes their 6th straight. With Crosetti's benching, he ends his consecutive
games played streak at 420, the longest current streak in the majors.

Syracuse SS Ace Parker, the IL's leading hitter, breaks his leg sliding home
in a win over Toronto. Parker will miss the rest of the baseball season but
be the 1940 MVP in the National Football League. At the end of the year he
will announce that he is giving up baseball for football.

1944
The Cubs beat the Phillies, 5-3, to snap a 13-game losing streak after
Charlie Grimm gives a four-leaf clover to starting P Eddie Hanyzewski,
who wore it under his cap. The Cubs are now 1-13 on the year.

Hal Trosky, making a comeback with the White Sox after having retired for 2
years because of migraine headaches, steals home in the 16th to break a 2-2
tie in a 4-2 win over the A's. By inning, it is the latest steal of home,
a feat Willie Davis will duplicate in 1964.

1945
Behind Phil Cavarretta's 4 hits, the Cubs beat the hapless Phils,
7-1. Cavarretta is hitting .365.

The Giants defeat the Reds, 4-3, for their 6th win in a row, but New York
CF Johnny Rucker goes hitless for the first time in 19 games. Rucker is a
nephew of great Dodger southpaw Nap Rucker.

1946
The New York Giants top the Boston Braves 5-1 in the first night game at
Braves Field. The crowd is surprised as their hometown heroes take the
field wearing shiny satin uniforms designed to reflect the light generated
by the electricity used for the evening contest. The game draws 35,945 for
the Braves, who will draw 468,083 fans for 24 night games this season. All
told, the 4th place Braves will pull in 969,673, nearly double the previous
high of 517,803 set in 1933.

The Red Sox lose their first game after 15 straight wins, as Tiny Bonham
beats Tex Hughson and Boo Ferriss 2-0 before 52,011 at Yankee Stadium. Tommy
Henrich hits a homer and accounts for both runs. The Red Sox are 21-4,
4 1/2 games ahead of the Yanks. The 15-game streak is still a Red Sox record.

1947
In front of 41,660 at Shibe Park - the largest crowd to date to watch a
baseball game in Philadelphia - the Phils take two from Brooklyn to take
three out of 4 in the series. The Jays win 7-3 and 5-4. In the first game,
the Phils score all their runs in the 3rd and 4th to give knuckler Dutch
Leonard his 5th win against a defeat, and his 2nd win in three days against
the Bums. Del Ennis' first homer of the year scores 3. Schoolboy Rowe,
with relief help from Ken Heintzelman wins the nitecap. He also bangs a
homer, and wins his 9th straight over two seasons. Harry Walker raises his
average in a Phils uniform to .406 and "closes out the nitecap with one of
the most spectacular catches of the season, a catch that would have made the
immortal Dode Paskert of 30 years ago doff his hat." (Philadelphia Inquirer)

The Cubs take over undisputed possession of first place sweeping a pair
from the Reds, 6-3 and 4-3 in 10 innings. Bob Scheffing drives in 4 runs
in the opener and Len Merullo's double in the 10th wins the nitecap.

Tigers Dizzy Trout and Virgil Trucks each toss a three hit victory over the
White Sox, winning 10-0 and 6-1. The losses drop the Sox out of a virtual
tie for first down to 5th. George Kell has 3 hits, including a HR, and 4
runs in the opener, while Hoot Evers and Pat Mullin bang homers in game 2.

1949
Scoring in every inning, the White Sox beat the Red Sox, 12-8. A team tallying
in every inning has only occurred five times in American League history.

1950
Connecticut Senator Abe Ribicoff introduces legislation for the observance
of a National Baseball Day.

After fans boo him for misplaying a ball, Ted Williams makes an inappropriate
gesture three times (once to left, once to center and once to right) to
the Red Sox fans sitting in the outfield stands. During his next at-bat,
as the booing continues, the Splendid Splinter becomes the Splendid Spitter
as Williams steps out of the box to spit at fans to show his displeasure.

Commissioner Happy Chandler voids the Dick Wakefield deal between the
Yankees and the White Sox. The Yanks immediately suspend the outfielder.

Airplane travel is still a baseball rarity, but a railroad strike forces
five clubs - the Red Sox, Yankees, Dodgers, Giants and Reds - to fly home
or away to play their next scheduled games. The Senators, with short hops
in the prospect, will take the bus.

1954
At Ebbets Field in the first game of a doubleheader, Phillies infielder
Jim Command gets his first major league hit, a grand slam off Carl Erskine,
and in the night cap, he doubles in two more runs. "Igor's" offensive output
during the twin bill will account for all of his major league RBIs.

1955
The Cubs click off 5 DPs in a come from behind 10-8 win over Brooklyn,
snapping the Dodgers' 11-game winning streak. Ernie Banks hits a grand
slam, the 1st of 5 he'll hit this year. The loss goes to Russ Meyer, who
had beaten the Cubs 17 straight times and 22 times in his last 23 decisions
against Chicago.

The Tigers buy OF Charlie Maxwell from the Orioles.

The A's continue to wheel and deal as they purchase OF Harry Simpson from the
Indians and P Ray Herbert from the Tigers. They give cash and P John "Sonny"
Dixon to the Yankees in exchange for RF Enos Slaughter and P Johnny Sain.

At Yankee Stadium, Early Wynn survives solo homers by Andy Carey and Mickey
Mantle to give Cleveland a 4-3 victory.

1956
In the bottom of the ninth inning at Forbes Field, Danny Kravitz' walk-off
grand slam off Jack Meyer erases a three-run deficit giving the Pirates a
dramatic 6-5 victory over the Phillies. It is the first career round-tripper
hit by the 25-year-old rookie back-up backstop.

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. The Cards trade pitchers Harvey Haddix,
Stu Miller and Ben Flowers to Philadelphia for P Herm Wehmeier and Murry
Dickson. Wehmeier, who lost to the Cards two days ago, has never beaten
St. Louis, losing his first game to them on July 3, 1949. The string of 14
losses to one team ties the ML record. The Cards also trade 2B Solly Hemus
for SS Bobby Morgan in a separate deal.

Los Angeles (PCL) edges San Francisco, 6-5, as starter Dick Drott fans 14
in seven+ innings and relievers Marino Pieretti and Bob Anderson strike
out 5 more. The 19 K's ties the league mark set in 1905.

1957
The Cards and Phils trade outfielders, St. Louis getting Glenn Gorbous and
Philley taking Chuck Harmon.

1958
Washington P Truman "Tex" Clevenger gets both the assist and the putout in
retiring Yankee batter Elston Howard. Clevenger is hit by a line drive and
the ball bounces off his leg into foul territory near 1B. Tex then covers
1B to receive the toss from 1B Norm Zauchin.

In the Phils 10-4 loss in the lidlifter with Pittsburgh, Phils OF Richie
Ashburn pulls a muscle. He sits out the 2nd game ending his consecutive game
streak at 473. Bob Friend wins the opener, overcoming back-to-back first
inning HRs by Repulski and Hamner. In game 2, AL castoff Bob Porterfield
wins a brilliant pitching duel with Curt Simmons, 1-0 in 11 innings.

Despite 14 walks by Cards pitchers in game 1, the Cubs lose 8-7, then
drop a 6-5 decision. Musial has a HR and 4 singles to come within 2 hits
of 3,000. The Cards use a NL record 10 pinch hitters in the regulation
doubleheader. They will tie the record in a doubleheader on July 13
vs. Pittsburgh.

1960
At San Francisco, Sam Jones hurls a 2-hitter and draws a bases loaded walk
for the only run as the Giants edge the Phils, 1-0. Owens is the loser.

The Phillies announce a trade of first baseman Ed Bouchee and pitcher Don
Cardwell to the Chicago Cubs for second baseman Tony Taylor and catcher
Cal Neeman.

1962
Minnie Minoso of the Cardinals suffers a fractured skull and broken wrist
running into the outfield wall while chasing a Duke Snider triple. The
Dodgers win 8-5. Minnie will be out of action until July 19th, then go back
on the DL on August 18th when Craig Anderson hits him with a pitch breaking
his left forearm.

The Phils whip the Cubs 12-2 behind Don Demeter's grand slam and 6 RBIs.

With 2 outs in the 6th, the Senators explode for 11 runs to rout the Orioles,
12-1. Woodling's grand slam is the big blow, but Chuck Cottier has 2 doubles
in the inning. Dave Stenhouse (2-0) pops out to end the inning,

Bob Belinsky wins his 5th straight as the Angels beat the White Sox,
4-2. Bo strikes out 11.

1963
Sandy Koufax' comeback from a circulatory ailment in his left index finger
continues with a no-hitter against the visiting first place Giants. He
walks 2 and fans 4 to run his record to 4-1. Wally Moon homers off loser
Juan Marichal in the Dodgers' 8-0 victory. This is the Dodgers southpaw's
second of four career no-hitters. The final out today is made by Harvey
Kuenn on a ground ball back to none other than Koufax. Kuenn will also make
the final out of Koufax' perfect game two years later.

The Yankees trounce the Orioles, 13-1, beating Milt Pappas. Mantle and
Maris each homer, the first time this year they've done it together.

Kansas City pitcher Ted Bowsfield takes a no hitter into the 9th against
Minnesota, but a walk to Versalles is followed by the Twins' first hit,
a single by Vic Power. Bowsfield allows another hit, but wins, 5-1. Jerry
Lumpe's 3-run homer provides the offense.

1965
Mel Stottlemyre stops the Red Sox, 5-3, and Mantle reaches base 4 times,
once on his 6th homer of the year.

The Pirates put Elroy Face on the DL, and he'll remain there till August 24.

to the Dodgers on September 10.

1969
Frank Howard hits two homers for the Senators but Don Mincher hits one in
the bottom of the 9th for a 6-5 Pilots victory. Diego Segui gets a win for
the second straight day. Yesterday the Pilots beat the Senators, 16-13,
on 12 hits and 12 walks.

1970
Ray Culp strikes out the first 6 Angel batters in Anaheim, but Boston loses,
2-1, in 16 innings. Culp ties the AL mark for the start of a game.

1971
In front of a sparse crowd of 2,992 at Cleveland Stadium, Indians starter
Steve Dunning hits a grand slam off A's right-hander Diego Segui in the
bottom of the second inning in Cleveland's 7-5 victory over Oakland. Dunning,
who came straight to the majors from Stanford, doesn't get the win. It will
take another 37 years before another American League hurler goes deep with
the bases loaded when Felix Hernandez of the Mariners accomplishes the feat
against the Mets in 2008.

1972
The Giants, who promised they would never trade him, send Willie Mays
to the Mets for minor league right-hander Charlie Williams and $50,000
cash. The 'Say-Hey Kid', clearly past his prime, returns to the city where
he brilliantly began his Hall of Fame career in 1951.

1977
Trying to snap the Braves' losing streak, Braves owner Ted Turner gives
manager Dave Bristol a 10-day paid leave and takes over as field manager,
wearing #27 on his uniform. After the Braves lose again - for the 17th
straight - to the Pirates 2-1, with Phil Niekro going to 0-7, Turner is
relieved of his new job by NL president Chub Feeney. A league rule prohibits
a manager from owning a financial interest in his club. Turner then makes a
public plea claiming harassment, but names 3B coach Vern Benson the manager
for the May 12th game.

Frank Tanana applies the calcimine in California's 6-0 win over Baltimore
and teammates Bobby Bonds, Don Baylor and Ron Jackson provide the offense
with consecutive homers in the 2nd inning.

1978
Jim Rice belts his 11th homer of the season to lead the Red Sox to a 5-4 win
over Baltimore. Fred Lynn adds a single, double and triple to help Bill Lee
(5-0) to his 5th win. Dennis Martinez takes the loss.

1980
In a 7-3 win over the Reds, Philadelphia's Pete Rose, 39 years old, steals
2B, 3B and home in one inning. It is the fifth time since 1928 that this
has been accomplished. The last National Leaguer to pull this feat was
Jackie Robinson in 1954. Dusty Baker will do it in 1984.

1981
Boston's Rick Miller goes 5 for 5 with a ML-record-tying 4 doubles in a
7-6 win over Toronto.

1982
The Twins trade ace reliever Doug Corbett and 2B Rob Wilfong to California
for minor leaguers Tom Brunansky and Mike Walters, and cash.

1984
The Tigers improve their record to 26-4 with an 8-2 win over the Angels and
establish a new record for the best 30-game start in ML history, eclipsing
the Dodgers 25-5 mark in 1955.

1988
Six games go into extra innings, tying the one-day ML record. The Mets
beat the Astros 9-8 in 10; the Pirates beat the Dodgers 2-1 in 11; the
Phillies beat the Reds 4-3 in 11; the Cubs beat the Padres 1-0 on Vance
Law's 10th-inning squeeze bunt; the Giants beat the Cardinals 5-4 on Kevin
Mitchell's homerun in the 16th; and the Indians beat the Angels 4-3 on
Bryan Harvey's 13th-inning balk.

1989
Just 3 days after vetoing a proposed trade to Pittsburgh for OF Glenn Wilson,
37-year-old catcher Alan Ashby is waived by the Astros making way for Craig
Biggio to take over.

The Tigers, with the worst record in the ML, lose 3-1 to their Toledo farm
club. The winning pitcher is 40-year-old Mud Hens manager John Wockenfuss,
who never pitched during his 12-year ML career.

1990
Citing a no-trade clause in his contract, Yankee OF Dave Winfield refuses
to report to the Angels after being traded for Mike Witt. Winfield will
eventually accept the trade on May 16th, ending his often stormy relationship
with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner.

1991
When a heckler taunts recovering alcoholic Albert Belle during Cleveland's
2-1 loss to California, the Indians' OF hits the fan in the chest with
a baseball from 15 feet away. Many in the crowd applaud Belle, who is
suspended for one week by AL president Dr. Bobby Brown and ordered to
contribute a week's salary to a charity of his choice.

Behind Eric Davis and Paul O'Neill, each of whom hit a pair of homers,
the Reds down the Cubs, 12-2. O'Neill adds a pair of doubles and knocks in
6 runs. Hatcher for the Reds and Dunston for the Cubs also homer.

1993
In the top of the seventh of a tied game at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium,
Jay Bell leads off the inning by grounding out to Phillies' shortstop Juan
Bell. The Pirate infielder is rung up by, none other than, first base umpire
Wally Bell.

1996
At Joe Robbie Stadium, Al Leiter tosses the major's first no-hitter of the
year, burying the Rockies, 11-0. Leiter (6-2), using mostly fast balls, is
in control all the way, and retires 5 batters in the 8th and 9th innings
on just one pitch each. He walks 2 and fans 6 in his masterpiece. It is
the first no-hitter in the Marlins' brief existence. In 1995 Leiter was
the AL's wildest pitcher.

At John Franco Day at Shea Stadium, the veteran reliever celebrates by
being ejected in the 5th inning following a vicious benches-clearing brawl
between the Mets and the Cubs. The brawl, which lasts 18 minutes, starts when
Mets P Pete Harnisch reaches around ump Greg Bonin to punch Cubs C Scott
Servais. There are 9 ejections, including Servais and Harnisch, who will
receive an 8 game suspension and a $1,000 fine for his punch. Mets bullpen
coach Steve Swisher, also ejected, will get a 2-game suspension. Fortunately
for the Mets, Rico Brogna was only punched, and he hits back with his 2nd
homer, to win 7-6 in the 9th inning. Brogna adds a triple and double on the
afternoon. In 1996, NL umps will toss 101 players, a decrease of 11 tosses
from 1995. AL umps will eject 75 during the year, down from 93 in 1995.

Jeff Blauser hits 2 homers, one a grand slam, and drives home 7 runs in

batting for Alexander, hits a 2-run pinch homer in the 9th and Butch Huskey,
hitting for Lidle, follows with another pinch homer. Both come off Dennis
Eckersley.

Ruben Sierra, released by the Cincinnati Reds last week, signs a minor league
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Sierra, 31, hit .244 with 2 homers with
the Reds. The Yankees sent Sierra to Detroit last season as part of the
Cecil Fielder trade, but Detroit is paying $4,875,000 of his $5.5 million
contract. Sierra will play 14 games with Toronto then get released again.

1998
Striking out 13 Diamondbacks in just 7 innings, Cubs' Kerry Wood sets a major
league record for strikeouts in consecutive games with 33 in two games. The
previous record for strikeouts (32) in two starts was held by Luis Tiant
(1968 - Indians), Nolan Ryan (1974 - Angels), Dwight Gooden (1984 - Mets)
and Randy Johnson (1997 - Mariners). Today the Cubs win, 4-2.

1999
The Rockies beat the Mets, 10-3, as southpaw Bobby M. Jones of Colorado
bests right hander Bobby J. Jones of NY. It is the 1st time this century
that two pitchers with the same name have started against one another. In
1876 George H. Bradley of Boston and George W. Bradley of St. Louis started
against each other twice. On April 16, 1899 John B. Taylor of Cincinnati
matched up with John W. Taylor of Chicago. In 1876 George H. Bradley
of Boston and George W. Bradley of St. Louis started against each other
twice. G.W. Bradley started all 64 of St. Louis' games that year.

The Astros pound out 18 hits in defeating the Pirates, 19-8. CF Carl Everett
drives home 5 runs for Houston, while 1B Jeff Bagwell and 3B Ken Caminiti
plate 4 apiece. Pirate backup catcher Keith Osik takes one for the team
when manager Gene Lamont puts him on the mound in relief instead of his
overworked relief corp. With the Pirates down 15-8 in the 8th, Osik walks
two, strikes out one, hits a batter and gives up two hits. He allows four
runs in his inning of work.

2000
At the age of 37, Florida's Joe Strong becomes the oldest player to make his
big-league debut since pitcher Diomedes Olivo played for the Pirates in 1960
as a 41-year-old. The 'seasoned' rookie throws 1 1/3 hitless innings. The
Marlins edge the Braves today, 5-4.

Manny Ramirez tags a first-inning grand slam and adds a two-run homer in
the sixth leading the Indians to a 16-0 rout of the Royals. The victory,
which stops Kansas City's winning streak at five games, is Cleveland's most
lopsided shut out in 45 years when the Tribe beat the Red Sox 19-0.

Beating the Cubs, 14-8, it takes the Brewers four hours and twenty-two
minutes to play a regulation nine-inning game. The time breaks the National
League record and ties the mark set by the Orioles and Yankees on September
5, 1997 for the longest non-extra inning game ever played. Today's contest
features 35 hits and 19 walks. Mark Loretta is 5 for 5 in the game, while
Glenallen Hill hits a 490-foot HR, which lands on the roof of a 3-story
building across Waveland Avenue.

in the 9th with a homer off the RF foul pole.

The Devil Rays defeat the Yankees, 1-0, behind P Steve Trachsel, who hurls
the first 7 innings. Trachsel, who defeated the Red Sox, 1-0, in his last
start, becomes the 1st AL pitcher in 24 years to win back-to-back 1-0 games.

2001
After another dreadful appearance yesterday in which Rick Ankiel (1-2,
7.13) threw five wild pitches to the backstop, the Cardinals send the
promising young fireballer to Triple-A Memphis to work on overcoming his
unexplainable lack of control. The lefthander has walked 25 batters in 24
innings this season.

In the sixth inning of a 7-2 loss to the Mariners, Carlos Delgado surpasses
Joe Carter as the Blue Jays all-time homerun leader as he hits his 204th
homer with the team. The Toronto first baseman, the current American League
leader with 14 round-trippers, acknowledges the standing ovation from the
SkyDome crowd with a curtain call.

An arbitrator rules that major league baseball must reinstate 9 of the 22
umpires who lost their jobs when they resigned last season.

2002
Tampa Bay defeats Baltimore, 6-4, breaking the Devil Rays' 15-game losing
streak. Randy Winn hits a 2-out 2-run HR off Jorge Julio in the 9th inning.

2003
Due the rash of recent injuries to the team's young arms, the Marlins
fire manager Jeff Torborg, who has been criticized for his handling of
the pitching staff. 72-year-old Jack McKeon, who has previously managed in
Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego and Cincinnati, will take over the 16-22
team becoming the franchise's sixth skipper. Pitching coach Brad Arnsberg
is also relieved of duty.

In his last at-bat on the current homestand, 38-year-old first baseman
Rafel Palmeiro drives a 3-2 fastball thrown by Indian hurler David Elder
to become the second player this season and 19th overall to hit his 500th
career homerun. The 370-foot shot over the right field wall at The Ballpark
in Arlington makes Raffy the first native of Cuba to reach the coveted
milestone. Palmeiro becomes the 19th player overall - and 5th-oldest -
to accomplish the feat. Today the Rangers pound the Indians, 17-10.

With the Cards leading the Cubs 11-9 at Wrigley Field in the top of the 5th
inning, the game is called on account of rain. Starters Matt Clement and Brett
Tomko give up all the runs, but they won't count against their ERA's. The
23-MPH wind helped Albert Pujols hit a grand slam and boosted homers by Tino
Martinez (2), Moises Alou, Corey Patterson, Troy O'Leary and Alex Gonzalez.

2004
Pittsfield city officials and historians release a 1791 document that they
believe is the earliest written reference to baseball. The 213-year-old bylaw,
used to protect the windows of the town's new meeting house by prohibiting
anyone from playing baseball within 80 yards of the building, was uncovered by
baseball historian John Thorn while doing research on the origins of baseball.

After missing yesterday's game to become an American citizen, Red Sox left
fielder Manny Ramirez, much to the delight of the Fenway faithful, leads his
teammates out of the dugout waving an American flag to celebrate his first
day as a citizen of the United States. As the 31-year-old native Dominican
Republic comes to bat America by Neil Diamond is played over the PA system.

Batting for the St. Paul Saints, Marc Turndorf hits a $5,601 popup in an
auctioned at-bat. The Los Angeles man had the winning eBay bid for the
opportunity to hit for the Northern League team.

2005
The Red Sox end a game for the second consecutive day by hitting a walk-off
homerun off the same pitcher, a feat only accomplished five previous times

Millar's decisive blast yesterday, is victimized today by BoSox backstop
Jason Varitek who goes deep in the ninth to beat Oakland, 6-5.

The Padres down the Reds, 7-2. Mark Loretta leads the Pods attack with 5
hits, including a double.

2006
Hideki Matsui's streak of playing in every game since starting his MLB career
with the Yankees in 2003 ends at 518 games as the left fielder breaks his
left wrist attempting to make a diving catch. The 31-year-old Japanese star
established the big league record for consecutive games to start a career,
surpassing Hall of Fame infielder Ernie Banks, who played in 424 contests
at the start of his playing days with Cubs from 1953-56.

The visiting Braves down the Marlins, 9-1. Matt Diaz strokes 5 hits,
including a double, for Atlanta.

day because of rain.

2008
At Shea Stadium, a 13-minute delay occurs in the beginning of the ninth
of the Mets 8-3 victory over the Reds, when David Ross bats out of order
making an out in Corey Patterson's place in the lineup. The very confused
umpires eventually make the correct call telling Ross to bat again, now
with one out, without his teammate having an opportunity to come to the plate.

2009
In a 13-5 loss to the Reds at Chase Field, Josh Wilson keeps his career ERA
at 0.00 by hurling a scoreless ninth inning to become the fifth Diamondbacks
position player to pitch for the team. The Diamondbacks infielder also
threw one inning for the Devil Rays in 2007.
