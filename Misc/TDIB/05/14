May 14

1902
New York batters Cardinal pitcher Mike Joyce for 14 hits sending the
Irish-born hurler to a 10-7 loss. St. Louis manages 9 hits off Christy
Mathewson, the winning pitcher. New York is a distant third to the leading
Pirates (19-3).

Without a goodbye to his St. Louis teammates, Davy Jones jumps the Browns for
a better offer from the Chicago Nationals. He takes a train from St. Louis
in the morning and plays in the 3-2 win over Brooklyn. Jones was hitting
.224 for St. Louis and will improve to .305 this year in Chicago.

1904
Dropping a 6-3 decision to New York, the Senators establish a major league
record by starting the season 0-13. Before Washington wins a contest this
year, the club will be 11 games out of first place.

In their 12-4 win over visiting Philadelphia, Chicago uses two bases-loaded
triples to win. This ties the NL record and is the first time this century
that it has happened. Chicago OF Jack McCarthy sprains an ankle by stepping
on the umpire's long-handle broom at home plate. NL President Pulliam orders
arbiters henceforward to use pocket-sized whisk brooms for housekeeping at
home. The AL will comply next year.

1906
Mathewson wins his first game of the season, scattering 9 hits and walking
an uncharacteristic 7 batters, but still beats the Reds, 6-3. The game is
1-1 after 8 innings, but the Giants jump on Orval Overall for 5 runs on 4
hits and 4 walks in the 9th to put the game away.

1907
The flagpole at the White Sox ballpark breaks during the pennant-raising
ceremonies celebrating the 1906 championship.

1910
Cleveland edges Washington 1-0, beating Walter Johnson. Nap Lajoie is 2
for 4 with a double for the winners. Johnson will win his next 4 outings
against Cleveland.

1911
More than 15,000 turn out for Cleveland's first Sunday game, and they see
a 14-3 win over the New York Highlanders. George Stovall paces Cleveland
with 4 hits.

NL president Tom Lynch asked umpires to "hustle the games along."

1912
The first-place White Sox batter the A's Jack Coombs out of the box in the
5th inning enroute to a 7-0 victory behind Joe Benz. Fresh from high school,
Herb Pennock debuts allowing the Sox one run in 4 innings of relief.

1913
At St. Louis, Walter Johnson tops Jack Coombs record of 53 straight scoreless
innings when he stretches the record to 56 innings. But after Washington
scores 6 runs, Johnson lets up against the Browns and Del Pratt's 4th inning
single drives in a run that snaps the skein. Ahead 9-1, Johnson is relieved
by Joe Boehling and Washington wins, 10-5.

1914
The White Sox' Jim Scott pitches a no-hitter for 9 innings, then loses to
Washington 1-0 in the 10th. The first hit is by Chick Gandil, who scores
on Howard Shanks' single. It is the first of a record three no-hitters that
White Sox rookie C Ray Schalk will catch in his 17 years with the team.

1916
Cardinals rookie Rogers Hornsby hits his first HR, off Brooklyn's Jeff
Pfeffer. It is a bounce HR (legal till 1931) that lands behind 3B and skips
into the stands at Robison Field in St. Louis. Brooklyn prevails today, 3-2.

1918
Sunday baseball is made legal in Washington, DC. District commissioners
rescind the ban in view of the large increase in the city's wartime population
and the need for recreation and amusement facilities.

1919
Chicago's Eddie Cicotte beats Boston's Carl Mays, 1-0, with the lone run
scoring on a Jack Barry error.

At Brooklyn, Hy Myers starts the scoring with a 3rd inning solo shot
over the right centerfield wall, reportedly the longest homer ever hit at
Ebbets Field. The Dodgers score another run and Burleigh Grimes wins, 2-0,
over the Reds, the 7th win in a row for Brooklyn over the eventual pennant
winners. For Myers it is his only HR at home - he'll hit 4 on the road -
as he will lead the league in slugging, with a .436 average, and RBIs,
with 73, both the lowest top totals in ML history.

1920
Beating the Tigers in 3 2/3 innings of relief at Griffith Stadium 9-8,
32-year-old Senator right-hander Walter Johnson registers his 300th
victory. Although the 'Big Train' hurled for mostly losing teams during his
21-year career, he will compile 417 victories including winning 20-games
or more for ten consecutive seasons (1910-1919). Johnson will beat Detroit
66 times in his career, the most wins over one team by an AL pitcher.

The Giants inform the Yankees that after the 1920 season, the lease allowing
the American Leaguers to play in the Polo Grounds will not be renewed. (The
Yankees have been tenants since 1913.) No reason is given but the recent
signing of Babe Ruth appears to be the main cause. Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert
responds that the Giants, "have gone back on their word." The Giants cave
in a week later, but by then Ruppert has initiated plans to obtain a site
for his own park to be completed in 1923.

1923
Paced by Wally Pipp's grand slam, the Yankees score 8 runs in the 12th
against the Tigers, to put the game away. Detroit comes back with three
runs in the bottom of the inning to set an AL mark (later tied) for most
runs in that frame.

1924
It is Babe Ruth Day at Yankee Stadium, as Ruth receives the AL MVP Award
for 1923. He is then held to a single as the Browns spoil the occasion with
an 11-1 win.

1927
During a game between the Phils and Cards, a section of 10 rows in the
RF stands at the Baker Bowl collapses from the weight of the crowd and
hundreds of fans fall on those below. There are many injuries, but the
one death that occurs is caused by the crowd stampede, not the stands
collapsing. Philadelphia is leading 12-4 in the top of the 7th - 4 runs
coming on Russ Wrightstone's 2nd grand slam of the year - when the tragedy
occurs, and the game is called. The Phils 12 remaining home games in May
will be played at Shibe Park.

Cubs pitcher Guy Bush must feel his name as he and Braves starter Charlie
Robertson battle for 18 innings before Robertson tires and the Cubs win
7-2. Jimmy Cooney drives in the winning run and Sparky Adams contributes 4
hits. Bush goes 18 innings and Robertson 17 1/3. Two NL pitchers - Hubbell
in 1933 and Law in 1955 - will match Bush's marathon effort.

1928
In Chicago, Charlie Root beats the Giants, 8-2. Fred Fitzsimmons takes the
loss. Outside the park after the game, John McGraw is knocked down by a
taxicab and suffers a broken leg that will keep him out of the dugout for
6 weeks. Roger Bresnahan takes over.

1929
After a slow start, the Athletics beat Detroit, 10-8, and move past the
Yankees into first place, where they will stay for the rest of the year. The
Yanks are rained out. Starter Jack Quinn, with the help of 3 relievers,
is the winner.

1933
With rain pelting down at Ebbets Field, Hack Wilson pounds a 9th inning
pinch grand slam, the first in Dodger history, to beat the Phils' Ad Liska,
8-6. The homer is inside-the-park, just the 3rd pinch inside-the-park
grand-slam homer in history, and the first since 1910.

In the opener of two games against the Browns, the Yankees almost go
scoreless, losing, 5-1.

1936
Joe DiMaggio bangs three doubles and a single to pace the visiting Yankees
to a 6-1 win over the Browns. DiMag will end the season with a .323 batting
average, and a .352 OBA, still below the league OBA average of .363. The
Browns shut out the Yanks yesterday to break their 13-game losing streak.

1938
After a 7-6 ten-inning loss to the Cardinals, the Reds file a protest
regarding a disputed hit by the Reds' Dusty Cooke. Cooke hits a ball that
bounced off the part of the RF pavilion at Sportsman's Park that juts out
over the playing field. The ball bounces back in play and Cooke reaches
3B. Reds manager Bill McKechnie contends it should be a HR, stating that if
it had been hit lower it would miss the pavilion and have been a homer. On
June 3, Ford Frick rules the game should be replayed as part of a August 20
twinbill. The Reds will win the first game, 4-2, then lose the nitecap, 5-4.

1939
Making his first appearance since elbow surgery in August 1938, Carl Hubbell
pitches New York to a 2-1 win over the Phillies. Catcher Ken O'Dea hits a
10th inning HR to win it for King Carl.

Next time, say it with flowers. Bob Feller's mother travels from Iowa
to watch her son pitch against the White Sox. It is the first time she's
seen him play in the majors, and she is given a box along the 1B line at
Comiskey Park. Sox 3B Marv Owen then lines a Feller fast ball that knocks
Mrs. Feller unconscious. She revives and, with a few stitches, is none the
worse. The Indians win, 9-4.

1940
Boston's Jimmie Foxx blasts a 10th inning HR off White Sox P Johnny Rigney
to give first place Boston a 7-6 win. The ball goes over the LF roof,
the longest poke in Comiskey Park history.

1941
Browns hurlers walk 19 Athletics. Starter Bob Harris issues 8 of the passes,
but the Browns win anyway, 10-5.

The Cubs finally give up on Dizzy Dean. Diz gets his release the same day that
brother Paul is sent to the minors by the Giants. Diz will sign on as a coach.

The Giants sell Ernie Koy to the Reds and send P Harry Gumbert to the
Cardinals for P "Fiddler Bill" McGee. Gumbert will go 11-5 for the Cards
in 1941 and pitch another 10 years.

1942
The Giants score 10 runs in the 8th inning to whip the Pirates 12-6 at
the Polo Grounds. Pinch hitter Babe Young bangs a double and a triple in
the rally.

1943
The Detroit Tigers play their 4th straight extra-inning game, losing to
the A's, 7-6.

northern Minnesota mining area.

1944
Connie Ryan singles with 2 outs in the 8th inning, as Reds P Bucky Walters

1945
Ex-serviceman Mel Bosser makes his ML debut with the Reds and walks 10

only pro experience is pitching in Class D, allows 8 hits and gets credit
for the 5-4 win.

1946
The Dodgers give away free nylons as a promotion and 31,000 show up for the
match against the Cardinals. Marty Marion breaks a 5-5 tie by driving in 2
runs in the 11th and Max Lanier goes all the way to beat the Dodgers. The
win leaves St. Louis a game back of Brooklyn.

Red Sox hurler Dave Ferriss uses just 78 pitches in pitching a 2-hit shutout
over the White Sox, winning 3-0.

1952
Despite 8 interruptions by Reds manager Sewell asking the umps to examine the
ball, Sal Maglie records his 6th straight win, 6-3, at the Polo Grounds. After

is the first ML player to homer on his 40th birthday.

At Baltimore, the Indians rap Mike Fornieles for 5 hits and 3 runs in the
16th to defeat the Orioles, 11-8. The Tribe had scored 3 in the 8th after an

steals home in the 14th for one Bird run and the 3rd run scores on Nixon's
wild throw.

The Yankees top Kansas City, 3-0, behind Tom Sturdivant. Tomorrow is supposed
to be an off day, but a rained out game with the A's is rescheduled. But a
group of Yankees go ahead anyway with a planned party and celebrate Billy
Martin's 29th birthday in a raucous fashion. An ensuing fight at Manhattan's
Copacabana Club leads to $5,500 in fines and the eventual trade of Billy
to Kansas City. Hank Bauer allegedly starts the fight by hitting a patron,
although Bauer denies it. The Yanks fine Ford, Bauer, Berra, Mantle and
Martin $1,000 each and Johnny Kucks $500.

ago, becomes the eighth Yankee to throw a no-hitter and sinks the Mariners,

Ken Griffey Jr, K's Jay Buhner, and induces Paul Sorrento to pop out to end
it. Gerald Williams saves the no-hitter when he runs down a 400-foot Alex

(2-3) has now thrown 16 straight innings of hitless ball.

mark since 1950, when they had an identical record.

1998
Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina's nose is broken when he is hit in the face

games. John Smoltz gets his league-leading 16th save in relief. The Braves
have won the last 70 games in which he has appeared - a major league record.

2005
Kevin Brown allows 5 runs in 6 innings but still wins his 100th AL game
as the Yankees pummel Oakland, 15-6. Brown has now won 100 games in each
league, the 9th player to do so. He's backed by homers from Derek Jeter,
A-rod, Posada and Tino Martinez, who drives in 5 runs.

steals four bases, in a 9-6 loss to the Orioles. Rickey Henderson, of the

Not here for my bat, Skip. P Clay Hensley of the Padres fires a 2-hitter
in shutting out the Cubs, 9-0. Hensley also ties a ML record by striking
out 5 times. On the opposite end, teammate Brian Giles walks five times,
the only time in the past 50 years that teammates have done both in a

in the same game had 5 walks and 5 K's, but they were not teammates.

After making an outstanding catch of Kevin Millar's line drive near the
Camden Yards warning track, Boston's left fielder Manny Ramirez high-fives
a fan before throwing the ball back to the infield to complete a 7-4-3
double play. Randy Dunning, a 24-year-old Red Sox fan attending the Orioles
game with his mom and dad, a going-away present from his parents before he
leaves Officer Candidate School at Fort Meade, is the glad-hand recipient of
'Manny being Manny'.

leader in thefts.

2010
Andrew McCutchen and Garrett Jones both collect five hits, including a homerun

2011
For the first time since 1914, the Dodgers are defeated after allowing just
one hit, losing to the visiting Diamondbacks, 1-0. Chad Billingsley, the

head, asks not to play after learning he has been slotted to hit ninth in
