when Andy Etchebarren, Sam Bowen, Boog Powell and Dave Johnson connect in a

and Paul Blair, the only time 7 teammates have each homered. Those HRs
make the difference in a 12-8 Baltimore win over the Red Sox. Boston's Carl

of 5 in one inning equals the ML record. Rounding out the round trippers
is Don Demeter for Boston.

Valentine's leg is severely broken when the 23-year-old outfielder crashes

for the Padres, Mets and Mariners.

the Padres 23-6. Three of the HRs are consecutive shots in the 5th by Larry
Biittner, Jerry Morales and Bobby Murcer. Larry Biittner goes deep a second
time with Dave Rosello, Gene Clines and Steve Ontiveros also clearing the
ivy. With a lead of 22-2, starter Bill Bonham is yanked after six frames and

(5) combine for a ML-record-tying 11 HRs, 50 hits and 97 total bases
during a wild 10-inning slugfest won 23-22 by the Phils. The 11 homeruns
hit in the game ties a major league mark, established by Chicago and their
opponents playing in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field in both 1967
(Reds) and 1977 (Mets). Dave Kingman has 3 HRs and 6 RBIs for the Cubs,
while teammate Bill Buckner has a grand slam and 7 RBIs. Mike Schmidt's 2
HRs include the game-winner in the 10th off Cub relief ace Bruce Sutter. Bob
Boone has 5 RBIs and Larry Bowa has 5 hits. The Phils jump to a 7-0 lead in
the 1st on 3 homeruns, 3-run shots by Schmidt and Boone and one by P Randy
Lerch. They lead 15-6 after 3 innings, and 21-9 going into the bottom of
the 6th, but can't hold it. Rawly Eastwick shuts out the Cubs for 2 frames
to win. The 2 teams combine to have 21 different players score runs and the
2-team total of 47 extra bases on long hits (24 - Phi) sets a ML mark for an
extra-inning game. It is the largest scoring game in the ML since August 25,
1922 when these same 2 teams met at Wrigley Field.

1984
In a 5-4 victory over Montreal at Jack Murphy Stadium, Padres second baseman

accomplished the feat in the senior circuit.

In the 3rd inning at Cincinnati, Mario Soto strikes out four Cub batters
(Tom Veryzer, Dick Ruthven, Bob Dernier and Ryne Sandberg) enroute to a 5-3

1985
The Rangers fire skipper Doug Rader and replace him with the Mets' third
base coach Bobby Valentine. Texas was 9-23 under Rader, the worst record in

in Texas.
