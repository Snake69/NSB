May 18

1902
White Sox pitcher Nixey Callahan has 5 hits against St. Louis, the 2nd of
3 times he'll do it. But his White Sox don't follow suit in a 17 inning
2-2 tie, the AL's longest game to date.

At Detroit, Cleveland follows yesterday's 14-0 whitewash by scoring 11 runs,
but Detroit wins 19-11 in a game called with 2 outs in the 7th because of
a storm. Cleveland scores 5 in the 3rd on 4 errors and 3 hits but Detroit
gets on the board by scoring in the 4th on Deacon McGuire's grand slam,
then plating 5 runs in each of the next three frames.

1905
The Pirates smack Mathewson for 9 hits and beat the host Giants, 7-2.

1906
Christy Mathewson, weakened from a bout of diphtheria, is pounded for 14
hits by the Pirates and loses, 7-6. Honus Wagner paces the attack with
2 singles and a triple and also picks off Bill Dahlen off 2B in the 9th
inning with the hidden ball trick. Dahlen, intently watching Lefty Leifeld
on the mound, misses Wagner who gently touches him with the ball. McGraw is
so furious with Dahlen that he slaps him with a $100 fine, later rescinded
(according to Bill Deane). The Pirates have now won 3 in a row from New York.

At Washington, the 6th place White Sox sock the Nationals, 10-0. Fielder
Jones has a 3-run homer, just the 2nd Chicago 4-bagger this year. The Sox
will total 7 on the season. The game is interrupted in the 6th when the Nats'
Tom Hughes goes into the stands after a fan who had been "kidding him."

1907
Hooks Wiltse pitches the Giants to a 6-2 win over the Cardinals. For New
York, it is their 17 straight win to run their season record to 24-3. Despite
the run, the Giants are in first by just one game over Chicago.

1908
Coming back against the Reds, Mathewson is treated poorly again. The Reds
pound him for 15 hits and 9 runs in 7 innings to win 9-5, handing Matty
his 3rd loss in a week.

1909
The Yankees sell infielder Neal Ball to the Cleveland Naps.

1910
The Reds collects 11 hits off Christy Mathewson, but the Giants outslug
Cincy to win, 10-6. It is Matty's 13th win in a row over the Reds. The
Giants score four runs in the 4th, four more in the 7th and two in the 8th
to pin the loss on George Suggs, now 5-1.

1911
Babe Adams pitches the Pirates to a 6-1 win over the Giants. The Bucs gang
up on Mathewson for 10 hits in 7 innings.

The Superbas edge the visiting Reds, 2-1, behind Doc Scanlan and Al Burch,
who has 3 hits and drives in both runs. Reds reliever Bill Burns is suspended
and sent home for laziness, after falling asleep on the stoop of the Brooklyn
clubhouse. During a recent game in Boston he was sent to the bullpen to
warm up and after throwing a few balls he went into the clubhouse and fell
asleep. "As a result Manager Griffith sent him home to get all the sleep
he desires" (New York Times, May 22, as noted by Kevin Gertsen).

1912
The Tiger players protest Cobb's suspension and vote to strike. Faced with
a $5,000 fine for failing to field a team, club owner Frank Navin orders
manager Hughey Jennings to sign up some local amateurs. Aloysius Travers,
Bill Leinhauser, Dan McGarvey, Billy Maharg (whose real name was Graham,
"Maharg" reversed), Jim McGarr, Pat Meany, Jack Coffey, Hap Ward and Ed Irvin
put on Tiger uniforms. Two Detroit coaches, Joe Sugden, 41 and Jim McGuire,
48, complete the lineup, and score the only two runs for Detroit. At Shibe
Park the Athletics set a club scoring record in winning, 24-2, as Travers,
a St. Joseph's College pitcher, goes all the way, giving up 26 hits, 24 runs,
14 earned runs and 7 walks (and strikes out 1) in 8 innings. The A's also
set an AL-home record for most runs without a homer. The only recruit to hit
for Detroit is Irvin, who enters in the 3rd inning and laces 2 triples in 3
at-bats. Irvin had been offered a contract by the Phillies before the season,
but did not want to be farmed out and refused. He closes his ML career with
a 2.000 slugging average (only 3 other players will debut with 2 triples -
Weatherly, McCovey and Sipin). Irvin will be killed in a barroom brawl in his
native Philadelphia in 1916. Only one ever plays another ML game ... Maharg
will bat once for the Phils at the end of 1916. He will also be involved as a
conspirator in the Black Sox scandal of 1919. A's starter Jack Coombs leaves
after 3 innings with a 6-0 lead, good enough for the win under the rules at
the time. Boardwalk Brown and Herb Pennock divide the rest of the pitching
for the A's. Starter Al Travers, having pitched his only ML game, returns
to his studies at St. Joseph's College and later becomes a Catholic priest.

The $400,000 Redland Field is dedicated in Cincinnati. A number of
dignitaries, including Pennsylvania governor John Tener, AL Prexy Ban Johnson
and White Sox owner Charles Comiskey are on hand. Designed by Harry Hake
at a cost of $225,000, the field replaces the aging Palace of the Fans
on the same site, and looks very much like the Crosley Field that will
eventually replace it. The Reds then delight the 20,000 fans by beating
Christy Mathewson and the Giants, 4-3.

1913
In Detroit, 25,000 show up to see Walter Johnson battle the Tigers. Washington
wins 2-1, with Detroit's only score coming on a Ty Cobb steal of home in
the 7th.

1914
In a 2-0 Boston win, Detroit's Ty Cobb is hit in the ribs by a pitch from
Boston's Dutch Leonard, but stays in the game. In Cobb's next at-bat, he
drags a bunt down the first base line and spikes Leonard when the pitcher
tries to field the ball. In a few days, Cobb will leave the lineup because
of a broken rib, the result of the pitch.

At Princeton University, Alexander MacMillan unveils his new invention,
an automatic pitching machine. Called a Bat-Ball, the device propels a ball
every eight seconds. At the unveiling, would-be batters are charged a penny
for every pitch thrown.

1915
On Suffrage Day, 4,100 women buy tickets to see the Giants-Cubs game in
New York, and the suffragettes announce they will pay five dollars to each
player who scores a run. "Wildfire" is the only recipient, as Chicago pulls
a first inning double steal with Frank Schulte on the front end. Heinie
Zimmerman is on the rear. The one run stands up against Jeff Tesreau and
Bert Humphries wins, 1-0, with each pitcher allowing three hits.

1919
The Yankees sell veteran Dutch Leonard, acquired in December from Boston,
to Detroit.

1920
Cleveland's Stan Coveleski avenges his Friday defeat to the Yankees by
shutting them out 5-0. The Indians split their 4 games in New York and
leave still in first place.

The Phils cut down the Cards, 1-0, behind Stengel. Casey triples, one of
two hits off Jess Haines, and scores the only run on a wild throw by catcher
Dilhoefer. George Smith is the winning pitcher.

Last-place Detroit topples the A's, 8-2, behind Howard Ehmke. Harry Heilmann
homers and Cobb triples, then swipes home in the 8th inning.

In Tokyo, the University of Chicago team beats Keio University, 1-0 in
10 innings.

1921
Penn State College wins their 17th straight victory. Combined with 11
straight to end last season, they have own 28 in a row.

The Boston Red Sox, behind Sam Jones' shutout, beat the Tigers, 2-0. Jones
will finish the year 16-5, with the best winning percentage in the AL. The
Red Sox score the only 2 runs in the game in the top of the 4th but the
Tigers prevent further scoring with a triple play on Ev Scott's liner to 2B
Ralph Young who flips to Donie Bush. Jones holds the AL's top two hitters,
Cobb and Heilmann, hitless.

1923
At Detroit, former Tiger pitcher, Howard Ehmke pitches his Boston Red Sox
team to a 6-2 victory in 10 innings. Cobb is 0 for 3 and caps the day with
a heated argument (under the grandstand), reportedly because Ehmke hit him
with a pitch.

1926
In the 8th inning at Yankee Stadium, Tony Lazzeri clouts a long
inside-the-park grand slam over CF Johnny Mostil's head as the Yanks come
from behind to beat the White Sox, 5-3.

1929
In the first game of a twin bill, the Dodgers rout the Phillies, 16-0. Johnny
Frederick scores five times giving the Brooklyn center fielder a major
league record of tallying eight runs in two games.

Brooklyn and Philadelphia score a ML-record 50 runs in a doubleheader at
the Baker Bowl. The Robins (Dodgers) win the opener 20-16, as neither team
makes an error, and the Phils take the 2nd game 8-6, despite a Dodgers triple
play. The highlights include Brooklyn's Johnny Frederick scoring 5 runs in
the opener, which combined with his 3 yesterday, gives him a ML-record 8
in 2 games. Both Frederick and teammate Babe Herman collect 5 hits in the
slugfest. Chuck Klein homers in each game, #'s 7 and 8.

1930
George Pipgras tosses his 3rd shutout of the season as the Yankees again
support his pitching by bombing the Red Sox, 11-0, in Boston. Babe Ruth
clocks an Ed Morris pitch over the RF bleachers, one of the longest homers
ever at Fenway.

At Washington, the A's nip the Senators, 1-0, behind Lefty Grove's
5-hitter. Philadelphia manages just 3 hits off Lloyd Brown. The Senators
now lead the A's by a game in the AL.

1931
Dodgers outfielder Babe Herman hits for the cycle for the first of two
times this season. In 1933, as a member of the Cubs, he will again hit
for the cycle, making him and Bob Meusel the only major leaguers to have
accomplished the feat three times since 1900. Today the Dodgers beat the Reds,
14-4. Al Eckert pitches 2/3 inning to take the loss, his last ML decision.

1933
The first ML All-Star Game is announced for July 6 at Comiskey Park. It will
be played as part of the Chicago World's Fair celebration and is sponsored
by the Chicago Tribune. Fans will pick the players.

1934
At Comiskey Park, Jimmie Foxx tees off against Ted Lyons and hits the first HR
to ever land in the CF bleachers. Hank Greenberg will match Double X in 1938,
then no one will reach the bleachers until Alex Johnston in 1970. Chicago
still wins, 5-4.

1935

Wilson to win the game, 1-0. Walter gets two of the three Phils hits off
young Roy Henshaw.

1938
After Bobo Newsom equals the AL record with 6 consecutive strikeouts,
Joe DiMaggio hits his 2nd HR of the game, and Newsom and the Browns lose
to New York 11-7. DiMag drives in 5 runs and WP Lefty Gomez knocks in 3.

At Detroit, Wes Ferrell pitches and bats the Senators to a 5-1 win. Ferrell
hits a solo homer, while his batterymate, brother Rick, goes hitless.

1939
The Athletics waive P Bud Thomas, acquired from the Senators on waivers on
May 1, to Detroit. Thomas will go 7-0 for the Tigers.

1940
After beating the Phillies 11 straight times over 2 1/2 years, the Reds'
Paul Derringer finally loses, 8-3. The Phils collect 12 hits in 8 innings
off Derringer.

The Cards collect just 7 hits off Hot Potato Hamlin, but all are for extra
bases to tie an NL record. The Dodgers lose, 6-2. Five of the hits are HRs
- 2 each by Mize and Terry Moore. Pee Wee Reese steals his 17th base in 26
games. The Cards have just 5 stolen bases.

Rufe Gentry wins his own game with an RBI single in the 8th inning. The
Tigers defeat the Athletics, 1-0.

1945

7 straight games postponed because of rain in the past 4 days. In the AL,
every game between the 14th and the 17th is rained out.

In a 15-12 Dodgers victory over the Cubs, Brooklyn's Luis Olmo hits a
triple and HR, each with the bases loaded. No 20th century ML player will
match this until Adam Kennedy does it in 2000. Olmo adds a double for good
measure. Former OF Ben Chapman is the winning pitcher.

Jimmie Foxx hits the 2nd pinch grand slam of his career, off Ken Burkhart,
to give the Phils an 8-7 lead. But St. Louis rallies in the 9th to win 11-8.

1946
In a great trade for Detroit, the Tigers acquire 3B George Kell from the A's
for popular hometown outfielder Barney McCosky. McCosky, back from the war,

Red Sox.

The Red Sox coast to an 18-8 win over the Browns as Mickey Harris wins his
7th straight. Ted Williams has a grand slam for Boston.

the first and ninth innings of a game.

1947
At Chicago, the Dodgers and Jackie Robinson attract a crowd of 46,572 -
still a single game paid attendance record at Wrigley. Brooklyn scores after
18 shutout innings and beats the Cubs, 4-2, extending the Cubs' losses to 5
straight. Robinson goes 0 for 4 to stop his hitting streak at 14 games. He'll
start a 21-game streak on June 14. Joe Hatten is the winner while Cubs starter
and loser Johnny Schmitz walks 8 and strikes out 9 before relief comes in.

Ewell Blackwell outpitches Mort Cooper to give the Reds a 2-1 win over the
Braves. Red Barrett then outpitches Johnny Vander Meer, 3-1, to give the
Braves a split for the day. Only a game and a half separate the first-place
Braves from the 5th-place Pirates.

In St. Louis, the Cards drop a pair to Philadelphia, losing 6-3 and
1-0. Ken Raffensberger wins the nitecap for the Blue Jays with a brilliant
complete-game shutout. Ken Heintzelman wins the opener for the Phils. Harry
Walker is 5 for 10 in the two games, while Emil Verban (.337) knocks in
the winning run in the 12th.

Curt Simmons. Four Phillie errors let in all three Cub runs.

An International League game in Jersey City draws less than 1,700 on a

leagues, especially in the East, are getting testy over the impact of the
major leagues open television policy.

have the bases jammed when Glaviano experiences his nightmare. He ties a
ML record set most recently by Dodger Billy Cox last year.

At the Polo Grounds, Al Walker poles a grand slam in the 6th inning for
the Cubs. In the bottom of the inning, Monte Irvin hits a grand slam for
the Giants, the first time in history that each team has slammed in the

four pitchers, is the loser.

1951

Redlegs P Bud Podbielan walks 13 batters in 10 innings against Brooklyn,
but holds on to win 2-1 on a Ted Kluszewski homer off starter Preacher
Roe. No one has walked 13 in the NL since 1918. The Dodgers strand 18
against the former Dodger pitcher, tying the NL mark.

The Tigers and Red Sox split a pair, with Detroit winning the opener 5-2
behind Ned Garner. Walt Dropo has a single, double and triple against his

(5-0) and Ellis Kinder.

1955
Cleveland scores 11 runs in the 5th to whip the Red Sox 19-0, and give Herb

runs ever in a shutout for the Tribe.

Milwaukee slugger Eddie Mathews undergoes an appendectomy and is lost for
2 weeks.

At the Stadium, Mantle's 8th inning grand slam off Mike Fornieles powers

at 2nd, leaving the sacks jammed. The Sox lose Minnie Minoso for 2 weeks with
a hairline fracture of the skull after he is hit by a pitch from Bob Grim.

1956

at least 100 minor league clubs for 1963. The minor leagues are reorganized
into 4 classes rather than 7. Classes B, C and D are grouped as Class A,
Classes AA and A become Class AA, and Class AAA remains the same, along
with the rookie classification.

1968
Frank Howard ties the AL record with a HR in his 6th consecutive game to
lead Washington to an 8-4 win over Detroit. His 10 HRs in the 6 games are

the most ever in one week (Sunday through Saturday). Earl Wilson will stop
him tomorrow. For Detroit, Al Kaline belts a pinch-HR off Steve Jones. It

Mickey Lolich hits him in the head with a pitch in his next at-bat.

Joe Pepitone is the Yankees' offense today as the Yanks sweep the Angels,

In Boston, Joseph Schnabel pleads guilty to stealing wills signed by baseball
Hall of Famers George Wright and 1920s umpire Tom Connolly and selling them
for more than $15,000. The discovery of the missing documents led authorities
in other parts of the country to realize they had experienced similar thefts.

2000
Mark McGwire passes Mickey Mantle into eighth place on the all-time home
run career list with 539. 'Big Mac' goes deep three times, and has 7 RBIs,
as the Cardinals beat the Phillies, 7-2.

The Padres defeat the Marlins, 6-2. Florida steals 10 bases in 10 attempts
in the game, falling 1 shy of the modern NL mark. Luis Castillo and Cliff
Floyd steal 3 apiece, while Mark Kotsay and Preston Wilson each pilfer a
pair. They are the top four batters in the Fish lineup.

Brothers Wilton and Vlad Guerrero each homer for Montreal, but Arizona
emerges the winner, 8-6, scoring two runs in the top of the 9th.

Tigers drive homeruns. The win goes to Victor Santos, his first ML win, but
his consecutive innings pitched without an earned run is snapped at 27 1/3.

The Diamondbacks defeat the Cubs, 4-0, as Randy Johnson (5 innings),
Byung-Hyun Kim (3 innings) and Bret Prinz (1 inning) combine on a
one-hitter. Coomer's single off the "Big Unit" is the only safety. The Cubs
have now lost 8 in a row. Before tomorrow's game, Julio Zuleta will borrow
a scene from the movie Major League and use a voodoo stick on the Cubs'
bats to instill hits. It works.

The Yanks stop Seattle's 8-game win streak, winning, 14-10. Ex-Mariner Tino
Martinez is 4 for 5 with a homer and 4 ribbies. John Halama is the loser
with 7 runs in 3 IP. Ichiro Suzuki is 3 for 6 with 2 steals to extend his
hitting streak to 23 games.

In San Francisco's 10-5 win over visiting Florida, the Marlins lose SS Alex
Gonzalez when he dives for a Barry Bond hit and dislocates his shoulder. He'll

be out until the 2003 season.

2002
After sitting through a 2-hour rain delay, the Red Sox defeat the Mariners,
4-1, behind the pitching of Pedro Martinez. Martinez strikes out the side
in the 1st inning on 9 pitches, the 17th time the feat has been performed
since 1970. Pedro is now 10-0 against the Mariners, with a 0.93 ERA against
them. For the M's, it is just their 4th road defeat in 21 games.

2004
At the age of 40, southpaw Randy Johnson becomes the oldest pitcher to
ever throw a perfect game as the Diamondbacks beat the Braves, 2-0. It is
the 17th perfect game in ML history. The 'Big Unit' joins Cy Young, Jim
Bunning, Hideo Nomo and Nolan Ryan as the only hurlers to throw no-hitters
in both leagues and creates the longest time span between no-no's having
first accomplishing the feat against the Tigers in June of 1990.

Jeremy Burnitz and Matt Holliday hit back to back homers twice, connecting
in the 2nd and 7th, to lead the Rockies to an 8-3 win over the Reds.

The Giants down the Cubs, 1-0, behind the 1-hit pitching of Jason
Schmidt. Michael Barrett's 2-out infield single in the 5th inning is
Chicago's only safety. Schmidt throws 144 pitches in his complete game win,
the highest pitch total in a game over the past two seasons. Besides Schmidt,
Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs and Mark Redman, then of the Florida Marlins,
are the only pitchers over the last two years to surpass the 140-pitch mark.

Mets employees placing a bet.

The Mariners defeat the Yankees, 7-6, to snap New York's 10-game winning
streak.

2008
It takes a pitchout and a perfect throw by Brewers catcher Jason Kendall,
but Jacoby Ellsbury is finally caught stealing after swiping 25 consecutive
stolen bases to start his big league career. The Red Sox outfielder is
second all time to Tim Raines who recorded 27 straight thefts with the
Expos before being caught in 1981.

With his seventh stolen base in the last two games, Marlins second baseman
Luis Castillo is one theft shy of tying a National League mark. The record
of 8 pilfered bags in consecutive games was set by Walt Wilmont of the
Chicago Colts (Cubs) in 1894.

2009
Jason Kendall collects his 2000th career hit when he singles in the Brewers'
8-4 victory over the Cardinals at Busch Stadium. The 34-year-old backstop
becomes the 254th player, but only the eighth to be primarily a catcher to
reach that milestone.

2012
Tigers right-hander Justin Verlander just misses pitching his third career
no-hitter when he allows a single to Josh Harrison with one out in the top
of the ninth inning. The reigning MVP and Cy Young winner completes the
one-hitter beating Pittsburgh, 6-0, in front of a very enthusiastic Friday
night crowd at Detroit's Comerica Park.

Kerry Wood ends his major league career on his own terms when he strikes out
the one batter he faces before walking off the mound into an embrace from
his 6-year-old son in front of the Wrigley Field dugout. The 35-year-old
much-injured Cubs right-hander, an All-Star as both a starter and closer,
believes today's final strike-out to be the most significant and the most
memorable moment of his 14-year career.
