May 8

1901
Amos Rusie, onetime Hoosier Thunderbolt, makes his first start for
the Cincinnati Reds after a two-year layoff and is bombed, 14-3, by the
Cards. Emmett Heidrick hits 5 singles off Rusie. After 2 more appearances,
he goes back to digging ditches, having won 245 games, mostly for the Giants,
in 9 years.

At New York, the Giants edge the Phillies, 9-8, using a hidden ball trick
to end the game. 1B Jake Ganzel applies the tag to Harry Wolverton for the
3rd out in the 9th.

In their long-delayed AL home opener, Boston defeats Philadelphia's Bill
Bernhard, 12-4, behind Cy Young, who jumped from the St. Louis NL team and
signed in the second week in March. Boston is led by Buck Freeman, who has
a single, triple and homer. Young complains that he does not like the rule
against pitchers warming up but he will still lead the AL with his 1.62
ERA. His 33 wins are 41.8 percent of his team's 79 victories, a post-1900
record, it will stand until Steve Carlton wins 45.8 percent of the Phils'
59 wins in 1972. Young also complains about catchers. "I do not like the
league rule compelling the catcher to stand behind the bat all the time. It
handicaps a pitcher. I cannot extend myself as I would like."

In a letter to AL team owners, Ban Johnson says that the rule requiring
clubs to cut their players to 14 will not be enforced until May 20th.

1902
Chicago again tops the Giants, winning 10-4. Cubs manager Frank Selee
comments that the distance from the pitcher's mound to the plate looks
short. Horace Fogel, the Giants manager, measures the distance and finds
the lane is 15 inches short. New York protests and it is upheld on June
3rd. The two games are ordered replayed and the Giants will win them both.

Bill Duggleby, the first jumper to return to the Phillies, loses, 2-1, to
St. Louis. Dugglesby, who made $1200 last year and jumped to the A's for
$2200, jumped back for $24000. Dummy Taylor rejoins the Giants after jumping
to Cleveland (AL) and will go 1-3. Returnee Chick Fraser will win his first
start on May 23rd, 5-2 over Chicago. Harry Wolverton will return after 59
games with the Washington Nationals. All others will remain with their new
teams. Of all those that the Athletics acquired, only Monte Cross stays.

At Detroit, the Browns beat the Tigers, 5-0, behind the 2-hit pitching of
Jack Powell. Both hits are by opposing pitcher Ed Siever.

1903
White Stockings pitcher Nixey Callahan gets 5 hits for the 3rd time in his
career (also June 29, 1897 and May 18, 1902), but the 11-inning loss to the
St. Louis Browns is the final game he will pitch in the major leagues. He
will play other positions until 1913. Nixey is the only pitcher ever to
garner five hits three times.

1905
In the 2-1 Pirate win over the Reds at Pittsburgh, OF Otis Clymer gets into
a fight with Reds 1B Cliff Blankenship. The bad feelings started several
days ago when Blankenship bumped Honus Wagner on the basepaths and Clymer
tried to retaliate by spiking Blankenship at 1B today. Blankenship twice
punches Clymer as both are tossed from the game. The first sacker is pelted
with bottles and a thrown knife by fans.

1906
Shorthanded because of injuries, Connie Mack puts pitcher Chief Bender
in LF in the 6th inning in a game against the Boston Americans. Bender,
who banged his first homer on May 5, responds with 2 roundtrippers, both
inside the park, off Jess Tannehill, in the A's 11-4 win. Bender will hit
just 3 more homers in his 16-year career.

A PCL game in Los Angeles is postponed when the Fresno team can't make
today's game because of a tunnel collapse delaying their train. In six days,
LA owner James Morley will forfeit his franchise to the league, paving the
way for the team to be taken over by a group of businessmen.

1907
Frank Pfeffer of the Boston Doves pitches a 6-0 no-hitter against the Reds,
striking out 3 and walking 1. He will be known as "Big Jeff" until his
younger, and bigger, brother Ed "Jeff" Pfeffer becomes a star hurler for
Brooklyn in 1913.

Christy Mathewson tosses his 2nd straight shutout, stopping the visiting
Pirates, 4-0, on 4 hits. Lefty Leifield takes the loss. First-place New
York has now won 10 in a row and holds a slim lead over Chicago.

1910
The New York Times reports on a foul ball hit into the stands during
yesterday's 7-2 Giants win over the Phils:  "The topic which is now to be
discussed is slightly removed from the silver thread of romance which runs
carelessly through this new item, but nevertheless it ought to be stated that
the Pinkertons at the Polo Grounds have started some classy detective work
to redeem the numerous new white baseballs which drip into the stands during
a game. One foul yesterday shot into the lower rows of the stands back of
third base. Old gum-shoes, who was on duty there, kept his eye peeled and
saw it drop into the crowd. He went after it. Five hundred voices yipped:
'He's got it,' and 500 fingers pointed at 500 different people. Why, Bryan
had a better chance of being President than that Pink had of finding the
ball. Just by way of diversion the crowd took the Pink's hat and untied
his necktie by way of showing that there are still a few fresh ones left on
earth who can be playful with the law. The only thing the detective found
was his way out of the crowd."

1911
The Phillies Grover Cleveland Alexander records his first shutout, stopping
Brooklyn 5-0 on 3 hits. Alex fans 9 to run his record to 4-1.

At New York, Smoky Joe Wood beats the Yankees, 4-0, in 6 innings. He gives
up just one hit, a single to Caldwell.

1912
The White Sox beat Washington 7-6, snapping Walter Johnson's five-game win
streak. Johnson gives up two 2-run homeruns, one to Harry Lord in the 1st
and another to Ping Bodie in the 5th. A Johnson fastball breaks the arm of 3B
Lee Tannehill, an injury that will hamper the infielder's throwing ability,
and ends the career of the 10-year veteran. Sox starter Joe Benz leaves
with an injury after pitching 1 1/3 innings; Ed Walsh pitches the next 5 2/3
innings, allowing 3 runs, and Frank Lange allows the same in his 2 innings.

The Giants score 9 runs by the 3rd inning and young Jeff Tesreau holds on
for an 11-8 win over the Cardinals. Mathewson relieves in the 9th for New
York. In the 7th inning, with a man on third, Tesreau grounds to SS Wally
Smith, whose throw to 1B hits ump Brick Owens in the head knocking him out
(as noted by Retrosheet). Owen's wife, who is watching from the grandstands,
faints. The runner is sent back to 3B and Tesreau hits again. Owens is back
at work tomorrow.

First baseman Heinie Zimmerman has a homer, triple and double to lead
Chicago to a 9-8 win over the Braves in Boston.

The Pittsburgh Filipinos, of the newly formed United States League, opens
the season at vacant Exposition Park. The team is named after its veteran
Deacon Phillippe, former Pirates star. The USL has promised not to sign
current major leaguers, but will not last through June.

1914
When the Senators relieve with Walter Johnson, the A's greet him with 6 runs
in three innings to drive the Big Train from the mound. Johnson throws the
one and only beanball of his career, a fast ball at the head of Frank "Home
Run" Baker, a particular nemesis of Johnson's. The beanball misses Baker,
whom Johnson calls "the most dangerous batter that I ever faced." Baker had
hit .385 against the Nat's ace up till this game (4 seasons); he'll hit just
.207 off him in the next 9 years. When the dust settles, the game ends in
a 9-9 tie.

1915
The NY Times headlines:  "BALL GRABBERS, READ THIS. Guy Clarke Fined $3
for Taking Ball Hit Into Polo Grounds Bleachers. "It isn't safe to try
to get away with a ball when a homerun is hit into the bleachers at the
Polo Grounds. Yesterday in the ninth inning Peckinpaugh of the Yankees
hit a homerun into the left field bleachers and the ball was grabbed by
Guy Clarke, a chauffeur, of 68 West Ninety-eighth Street, who tried to
get away with the prize. Tom Kelly, one of the park policemen, tried to
pursuade Clarke to give it up but he refused, so he was arrested by a
policeman who was summoned from outside of the park. In the Night Court,
Magistrate Sims told Clark that he had no more right to take a baseball at
the Polo Grounds than he had to take his (the magistrate's) watch. James
McIlravy of the park police stated to the court that between twenty-five
and thirty balls were lost at the grounds each week. Clark was fined $3."

bleachers once stood.

The Yankees score 7 in the 2nd but lose to Detroit 14-10, knocking themselves
out of the lead. Washington moves into first.

shutout of the Sox. Batterymate Pat Collins homers in the 7th, while Gehrig
adds a pair of triples.

At Detroit, Marty McManus singles in 2 runs in the 9th to lead the Tigers
to a 3-2 win over the Red Sox. Bob "Fats" Fothergill goes hitless for the

(42 for 84) during the streak, which began last year. Fats will hit .500
during another 20-game streak this year from August 31 through September
21. Fothergill is the only player to hit .500 or better in two 20-game
hit streaks.

no-hitter against the Pirates, allowing just one walk. In the 9th, the 1st

the game-ending DP. It's the first no-hitter by a lefthander since Hub
Leonard in 1918. Chick Fullis starts the scoring with a HR in the 2nd,
his 3rd in three days, and Mel Ott adds 2 HRs to take the NL lead. The

slow-footed Lombardi also has a "long single" in the 23-hit 15-4 win over

nitecap, the Phils snap their 9 game losing streak with a 5-4 victory.

At Ebbets Field, in the first twilight game in 24 years, the Dodgers top the
Giants, 7-6, with Dolph Camilli's 7th inning homerun onto Bedford Avenue the
big blow. With more than 24,000 fans on hand, nearly $60,000 is raised for the
Navy Relief Fund, as all the proceeds are donated. Everyone, including the
ball players and umps, pay their way into the park. The Dodgers also debut
a celebrated rookie - Gladys Gooding, who plays the "Victory Calliope",
the second organ played in ML stadiums. Gooding was discovered by Larry
MacPhail at a hockey game at Madison Square Garden. Besides the Rangers,
Gladys later is the organist for the Knickerbockers, and will write the
Dodgers' theme song "Follow the Dodgers." Gooding will play for the Dodgers
until 1958 when the team moves west.

retires Taffy Wright for the last out and the Sox have now won 13 straight.

The Reds blow a 5-2 lead in the 9th when 1B Bert Haas trips over the bullpen
mound and misses an easy pop fly by Eddie Stanky that would've ended the

3-run pinch homer by Don Padgett. 2B Lonnie Frey of the Reds throws out 6
straight runners as part of an 11-assist game and adds a triple and 2 singles.

At Griffith Stadium, Detroit 2B Eddie Mayo snags a 3rd inning liner off

drive to start the TP.

1947
A movement among Cardinal players to protest its first meeting with Jackie
Robinson and the Dodgers is aborted by a clubhouse talk from owner Sam

Ruth's shot in 1922, and is the first of Doby's four career inside-the-park
homers. World War 2 veteran Gene Bearden makes his first start, allowing
just three Nat hits. He walks 4 in the 9th inning to allow the lone run,
as Washington finally scores after three straight shutouts.

1966
The last game is played at Busch Stadium, known for most of its existence as
Sportsman's Park. The 64-year-old ballpark, which served as the home field for

a 10-5 loss to San Francisco.

pitches in his 500th game:  all have been in relief, a ML record.

For the second time in his career, Pirate Willie Stargell poles one out of
Dodger Stadium. His blast off Andy Messersmith is over the 50-foot high RF
pavilion roof 470 feet away. His first HR, a 506-foot shot, came off Alan
