May 23

1901
In Chicago, the A's score 2 in the 9th to close to an 11-7 deficit with
the White Stockings. Sox manager Clark Griffith relieves with the sacks
filled and no outs and pays the supreme compliment to Philadelphia's Nap
Lajoie - he issues him an intentional walk. Griff then gets 3 ground outs
and Chicago wins. Not until (possibly) Mel Ott, on the last day in 1929,
and Swish Nicholson in 1944, will a batter be passed intentionally with
the sacks filled.

At Cleveland's League Park, the Blues score a ML record 9 runs with 2 outs
in the 9th inning to defeat the Washington Nationals 14-13. Cleveland is
down to one strike, on Jack McCarthy, but they put the next ten men on base,
winning the game on an error. Winning pitcher Bill Hoffer, who had given
up the 13 runs, is carried off the field by the delirious crowd. Patton and
Watty Lee pitch for Washington. The scoring (as noted by Bill Kirwin) occurs
as follows:  Hoffer strikes out, Pickering grounds out, McCarthy singles,
Bradley singles, LaChance with two strikes on him) singles scoring McCarthy,
Wood is hit by pitch, Scheibeck doubles (Patton, replaced by Lee), Egan
walks, Beck (batting for Hoffer) doubles, Pickering singles Beck home to
tie the game, and then moves to 2B on a passed ball. McCarthy, who started
the whole thing, singles him home for the victory.

1902
Cleveland financier Charles Somers, who is also the president of the Boston
club, meets with Lajoie in Philadelphia and guarantees him a 4-year contract
at $7,000 per year no matter what the legal outcome of his case. Lajoie had
played one game, then sat in the stands. In 1903, Cleveland fans will vote
to rename the club the Naps in honor of Lajoie.

1904
Chicago's Jake Weimer and Christy Mathewson duel for 11 innings before the
game is called a 1-1 tie. Ump Bob Emslie calls the game at the West Side
Grounds so the Giants can catch a train for New York. Matty allows 6 hits,
one less than Weimer.

1905
Paced by Bill Dahlen's two homeruns, the Giants scrub Orval Overall for a
7-0 win over the Reds. Christy Mathewson strikes out 8 and allows just 3
singles for the win.

1906
With an off day, Chicago city officials close the gates at West Side
Grounds in the middle of the series with the Giants. The reason is that
city ordinances state that no fans are allowed to sit or stand in the aisles.

In Oakland, the San Francisco Seals play the first PCL game in the Bay
Area since the earthquake, beating the Fresno Raisin Pickers, 4-3. Their
new park will be ready for the Seals by the start of next season.

1907
Before a packed house of 23,000, McGraw uses his entire pitching staff
of six against the Cubs, but Chicago still wins, 5-2, to move into first
place over New York. Wiltse lasts just one inning, giving up two Chicago
runs. Jimmy Sheckard's three-run homer in the 5th off Mathewson, pitching
on a day's rest, seals the win for Chicago.

1908
Giants 3B Art Devlin ties a record by handling 13 total chances as the
Cards beat New York 6-2. Two errors cost him a new record.

Chicago Cubs pitcher Carl Lundgren beats the Boston Nationals, 6-4, his
10th straight win over them in 4 years. Lundgren will post an 18-7 record
this year, allowing no homers.

1910
In the top of the ninth inning in a game against Boston, Cincinnati's
outfielder Dode Paskert steals second base, third base as well as home
plate. The thievery proves to be the margin of victory when the Reds edge
the Doves, 6-5.

1911
Detroit beats Washington's Walter Johnson, 9-8. Detroit loads the bases
in the 8th inning for Ty Cobb, already 3 for 4 with 3 stolen bases, and
Walter Johnson, in relief of Gray, walks him to force in what will be the
winning run.

At Hilltop Park, New York's Christy Mathewson continues his mastery of the
Reds, beating them, 7-2, for the 18th straight time.

1912
The Reds defeat the visiting Pirates, 12-1, stealing 7 bases against the
Bucs. Bescher has 3 and Rube Benton, the winning pitcher, adds a steal
of home.

At St. Louis, Slim Sallee stops the Giants to preserve the Cards lead,
and the Birds win, 4-3, over Mathewson.

1916
In Cincinnati, Rube Benton pitches the Giants to a 4-3 win over the Reds,
New York's 12th win in a row on the road. Benton needs relief help from
Tesreau and Mathewson in the 9th to win.

1917
Grover Alexander of the Phils allows the Reds only 2 hits; he collects 3
himself, including a HR and a sacrifice, and wins, 5-1, over Fred Toney.

1918
The Giants win 6-4 in St. Louis, no thanks to outfielder Benny Kauff who
strikes out 5 times. The 5 K's ties the ML record.

1919
It's Hank Gowdy Day in Boston, the catcher's first game after returning
from the Army. He hits the first pitch he sees from Dolf Luque for a single,
but the Reds prevail over the Braves, 10-4.

Phillie slugger Gavvy Cravath treats his old teammate Pete Alexander unkindly,
collecting 3 hits and 5 RBIs to lead the Phillies to a 7-2 win over the
Cubs. The winning pitcher is George Smith, just acquired from the Giants for
P Joe Oeschger. Oeschger will be bundled to the Braves in August for Art Nehf.

Eddie Cicotte overwhelms the Yankees as the White Sox win, 5-0.

1920
The Braves beat the Reds, 7-0, behind Jack Scott's three-hitter. Boston
chases Jimmy Ring in the 3rd inning and go on to tally 12 hits.

After a week in bed with illness, Babe Ruth returns to belt a two run
homer in the 6th, off Carl Weilman, to give the Yankees a 3-2 win over the
visiting Browns. Baby Doll Jacobson's two run homer in the 4th is the only
Browns scoring off Bob Shawkey.

1922
George Sisler and Frank Baker match homers as the Browns and Yankees go into
the 7th tied 3-3. Ken Williams #12, with 2 on, gives St. Louis a 6-3 lead,

Shocker is the winner.

1923
Pittsburgh sends 2B Cotton Tierney and P Whitney Glazner to the Phils for
2B Johnny Rawlings and P Lee Meadows. Meadows will win 85 games over the
next 5 years as Glazner's replacement in the Pittsburgh rotation.

1924
Walter Johnson strikes out 14, a career-high, including 6 in a row to tie an
AL mark, in a 4-0 one-hitter over the White Sox for his 103rd shutout. Harry
Hooper, who had the lone hit in a 1915 game against Johnson, does it again
to spoil 'Big Train's' bid for his second career no-hitter. Johnson will
have his best season in 5 years, going 23-7.

1925
In Philadelphia, Reds pitcher Pete Donohue has 5 hits - 4 singles and a
homer - in beating the Phils, 11-2.

The Cards trade C Mike Gonzalez and infielder Howard Freigau to the Cubs for
catcher Bob O'Farrell. O'Farrell, who suffered a fractured skull from a foul
tip, played just 71 games in 1924 and lost his job to Gabby Hartnett. But
O'Farrell will have a banner year for the Cards, hitting .293 and catching
146 games, and then take over as manager in 1927. Freigau will hit .307
for the year.

1926
Hack Wilson smacks a 5th inning homerun, a rare blast off the Wrigley Field
scoreboard, situated at ground level, to start a route of the Braves. The
Cubs score 7 runs in the 8th inning to win 14-8. Sparky Adams contributes
4 hits for Chicago. Later that night, Wilson and a few others are arrested
at a friend's apartment for drinking beer in violation of the Prohibition
Act. The scoreboard will be moved to the left field corner in 1937, before
one will be built atop the newly built bleachers.

In Washington, Al Simmons hits a solo HR, off Walter Johnson, into the CF
stands. The A's beat the Big Train, 5-3, behind the pitching of Slim Harriss.

1927
Despite first inning back-to-back homeruns by Ruth and Gehrig off Sloppy
Thurston, the Senators edge the Yankees, 3-2.

1928
Jack Slattery quits as manager of the last place Braves. Owner Fuch announces
that "after much persuasion" Rogers Hornsby has consented to takes over
as manager.

Cleveland left fielder Charlie Jamieson starts a triple play against the
White Sox in a 4-3 loss. Today's TP occurs when Bud Clancy is out on a
short fly to Jamieson, who then throws out Johnny Mann, the runner on third
who tries to score. The relay from C Ray Sewell to his brother Joe at 2B
catches Ray Schalk off base, and he is tagged at 3B. Jamieson will start
another triple play against the Yankees on June 9.

1929
In Philadelphia, the A's win a pair from the Senators by 9-8 scores. In
game 1, they spot the Senators 8 runs in the first 2 innings and then come
back to win. The win goes to Howard Ehmke, the A's 4th pitcher. Walberg
goes all the way to win the nitecap. Bluege has a HR in each game for the
Nationals. The first-place A's will sweep the series with the Nats.

The Browns split a pair with the Indians, losing the opener 5-4 in 12
innings, and taking the nitecap, 7-5. Oscar Melillo paces the 2nd game
offense by hitting for the cycle.

1930
Despite a homer by Bill Terry in the 8th and a 3-run shot by Ott in the 9th,
Carl Hubbell loses to the Phillies 9-8. Philadelphia bangs out 17 hits,
including a HR by Pinky Whitney, against King Carl.

1931
Cleveland's Earl Averill cracks 3 doubles and a HR in a 10-5 win over
Chicago. Averill is the 2nd Indian this year to get 4 extra base hits in
a game. Vosmik, who did it earlier, has a pair of doubles today.

1934
Boston's Lefty Grove allows 5 early runs, then settles down to beat the
Indians, 7-5. Down 5-4 in the 9th, Grove hits for himself and singles. Grove
will lose his next 4.

1935
The first-ever scheduled major league night game is rained out in Cincinnati,
but the team will face the Phillies tomorrow night. The Reds will play
eight evening contests this season, including one against every club in
the National League.

Cleveland has an internal problem between manager Walter Johnson and two
veterans, 3B Willie Kamm and Glenn Myatt. Judge Landis refuses to intervene,
and Kamm is eventually made a scout while Myatt is released. Johnson
continues his shaky tenure, which will not last the season.

1936
At Crosley Field, following a single by Lee Handley, and two pinch hitters
reaching base, Sammy Byrd hits a pinch ultimate grand slam in the bottom of
the 9th to give the Reds a 4-3 win over Pittsburgh. Bucs starter Bob Swift
loads the bases and reliever Cy Blanton serves up just one pitch to Byrd
who lets it fly. Byrd will hit one more homer this year and then retire
next March 10 to play professional golf. The three pinch hitters scoring
ties the NL record. Byrd, a 29-year-old outfielder, becomes the third major
leaguer to hit an ultimate walk-off grand slam, which is a homer that comes
in the home team's final at-bat and erases a three-run deficit resulting
in a one-run victory.

Tony Lazzeri hits 3 HRs, 2 in the nitecap, good for 4 RBI as the visiting
Yankees pound the Athletics, 12-6 and 15-1. The crowd of 24,240, one of
the largest in several seasons, pelts the field with cushions, bottles and
other articles, making play difficult. Dickey, Chapman, Rolfe and Crosetti
also homer for NY.

1938
Cub Bill Lee tops the Braves, 4-1, as the Braves score their only tally
in the 4th when pitcher Lou Fette drives in the run. This is the only run
that Lee will allow in 47 straight innings going back to the 19th, when he
tossed a shutout. He will shut out the Pirates 5-0 on May 27, the Reds 3-0
on May 30, and the Braves 4-0, on June 3.

1939
P Boots Poffenberger is suspended by the Dodgers and fined $400 for breaking
training rules. Brooklyn acquired Boots over the winter.

1940
In front of just 793 paid customers in St. Louis, the Browns trip the
Senators, 8-7 in 12 innings. Jimmy Bloodworth's 2-run HR gives the Nats the
lead in the top of the 12th, but George McQuinn's 2nd homer of the day,
a single and a triple by Rip Radcliff, who scores on a sac fly, gives
St. Louis the win over Sid Hudson.

1944
Wartime restrictions are eased, and Ebbets Field is the scene of the first
night game in metro New York since 1941. The Giants Bill Voiselle loses a
2-1 9th-inning lead because an apparent last-out fly ball is dropped by CF
Johnny Rucker when Charles Mead runs into him. Two runners score and the
Dodgers win 3-2. In other cities, there was no restriction on night play,
but games could be interrupted at any time by test blackouts.

Milwaukee defeats Toledo 28-0 in an American Association game.

1945
Mort Cooper is traded by the Cardinals to the Braves. The three-time
20-game winner has twice jumped the club in a salary hassle. Threatening
to run out again unless his contract is increased from $12,000 to $15,000,
Cooper is swapped by owner Sam Breadon to the newly affluent Braves for Red
Barrett and $60,000 cash. Cooper will develop arm trouble while Barrett,
9-16 in 1944, will win 21 games for the Cards this season.

1946
Police sit along the dugouts of both clubs at Ebbets Field after yesterday's
brawl but that doesn't stop a pregame fight between Dodger Dixie Walker and
Cub Lenny Merullo. The first place Dodgers again win, 2-1, in 11 innings. The
pregame fight will cost 5 players $650, plus suspensions for Walker, Merullo
and Cubs coach Smith. Galan gets tossed in the 4th and Durocher in the 9th.

The Cardinals, the pre-season favorites to win the NL pennant, suffer a blow
when pitchers Max Lanier and Fred Martin, and infielder Lou Klein jump to
the Mexican League. Lanier was 6-0 in 6 starts this season. The 2nd-place
Cards win today at the Polo Grounds behind Johnny Beazley's 4-hitter,
but will lose 3 of their next 4 starts and drop into 2nd place.

The Yankees deflate Virgil Trucks with HRs in the 5th inning by DiMaggio
and Nick Etten. Joe Gordon then greets reliever Hal White with the Yankees
3rd consecutive HR, and the Bombers drive over Detroit 12-6.

1947
The Yankees beat Boston, 9-0, as Allie Reynolds fires his 2nd two-hit
shutout over the Red Sox in a month. Harry Dorish is the loser.

At Boston, John Mize hits his 7th career grand slam in New York's 6-run 3rd
inning to lead the Giants to an 8-1 win. The victory moves the Giants into
1st place ahead of the idle Cubs.

1948
Yankee slugger Joe DiMaggio hits three consecutive homeruns, the first two off
future Hall of Famer Bob Feller. The trio of round-trippers helps the Bronx
Bombers defeat the Tribe, 6-5, in the first game of a double-header. Behind
Don Black, the Indians take the nightcap, 5-1, to preserve first place.

1950
Pittsburgh's first bonus baby Bill MacDonald (13-11 at New Orleans in 1949)
makes his first ML start and shuts out the Phillies, 6-0. MacDonald will
finish the season at 8-10 for the last-place Bucs before going into the
service in 1951. He'll win just one more ML game after that.

1951
Mel Parnell gives up 4 hits in shutting out the Browns, while stroking 4 hits
himself. Ted Williams walks 5 times in the 12-0 win. Vern Stephens sets an
assist record for third basemen, with an assist from SS Johnny Pesky. On
the last out of the game, a grounder to Pesky, he flips to Stephens, who
fires to 1B to set the record at 10 assists. Malzone will equal the record
in 1957 and Ken McMullen will top it, in 1966.

The Reds' Connie Ryan clouts an 11th inning grand slam to beat the Cardinals,
5-1, in St. Louis.

1952
The Dodgers jar the Phils, 5-1, as Campanella drives in all five runs. Campy
has two homers (#99 and #100) in his first two at-bats, including a grand
slam. In his final at-bat yesterday against the Reds, Campy also homered. Ben
Wade wins over Karl Drews.

Sal Maglie wins his 8th without a loss, stopping the Braves, 5-3. Maglie
tires in the 9th, giving up three hits, including a 2-run homer by Ebba
St. Claire. Al Dark's 2-run homer in the 5-run 4th is the big blow for the
Giants, who stay a half-game in back of the Dodgers.

The Phillies send P Bubba Church, 15-11 last year, to Cincinnati for OF
Johnny Wyrostek, an all-star the past 2 years, and P Kent Peterson.

George Kell.

1956
The Oakland Athletics score 2 runs in the 9th to tie the Washington Senators

run scores on a wild pitch by Camilo Pascual and the winner comes on a Jim
Finigan homer.

1957
At Ebbets Field, the Yanks top the Dodgers, 10-7, in the Mayor's Trophy
game. Al Cicotte allows 2 hits in 6 innings, and smacks two himself. Mantle
is 4 for 5.

Willie Mays hits his 200th career homerun, a two-run shot off Warren Spahn in
the ninth inning of a game against the Milwaukee Braves at County Stadium. As
it turns out, the homerun drives in the decisive runs of the game as the
San Francisco Giants down the Braves, 5-3.

1959
The Athletics' Bud Daley beats the White Sox 16-0, keeping Chicago a 1/2

no errors. But the Cubs lose, 2-1, in 10 innings to the Phillies.

1962
Joe Pepitone homers twice to become the second player in Yankee history and
the 6th player in AL history to hit two homeruns in the same inning when
the Bronx Bombers score nine times in the eighth inning of a 13-7 rout of
Kansas City. In 1936 as a rookie, Joe DiMaggio became the first pinstripper
to accomplish the feat.

1963
Baltimore vet Robin Roberts two-hits the Senators to win 6-0. Both hits
are by weak-hitting Eddie Brinkman.

Pittsburgh trades OF Bob Skinner to the Reds for OF Jerry Lynch.

1964
At New York, the Angels score 4 in the first, and the Yankees counter with 5
in the bottom of the inning off Bo Belinsky. That's all the scoring for the
pinstripers as the Angels win 9-5. This is the 2nd game this season that
the injury-plagued Yanks have started their regular outfield of Mantle,
Maris and Tresh. Mantle will pull a muscle on the 26th, keeping him out of
the lineup for 2 weeks.

1965
Mets outfielder Ron Swoboda takes up his position wearing a batting helmet
- on his foot. After kicking the protective head gear it got stuck on his
spikes, and manager Casey Stengel ordered the young player to go out to
the field.

In the first inning of a 5-2 loss to San Francisco, Jimmy Wynn is unable to
catch Jim Ray Hart's two-out routine fly ball when the ball is lost in the
glare of the diffused Texan sunlight streaming through plastic panes of the
the newly-opened Astrodome. The play, now a base-clearing inside-the-park
three-run homerun instead of an easy third out, results in the painting of
the ballpark's ceiling the next day and will lead to the use of Astroturf
next season because the grass will be unable to grow due to the reduced
amount of sunshine.

The Dodgers score 2 in the 1st off Bob Buhl, but then are shut out for the
next 15 innings by Cubs pitching. Chicago scores in the 6th and 9th and

The Braves trade OF Lee Maye to the Astros for P Ken Johnson and OF Jim
Beauchamp.

1969
Mickey Lolich sets a Detroit record with 16 strikeouts while defeating

inning, and the Bucs lose 3-0 at San Francisco.

1970
Giants manager Clyde King is fired following a 15-inning 17-16 loss to
San Diego in which they blow an 8-0 lead. Charlie Fox is named as the new
skipper. A 15th inning HR by Huntz, one of 9 homers in the game, ends the 5
hour 29 minute affair. San Francisco is four games under .500 with a 19-23
record at the time of the Goldsboro, NC native's dismissal.

Dick Allen belts 2 homers to drive in all the runs as the Cardinals beat
the Phillies, 3-1. Bob Gibson allows 4 hits and strikes out 16.

Niekro, notch shutouts as the Tigers sweep a doubleheader from the Senators
5-0 and 11-0. The loser in the opener is Denny McLain, making his first
appearance in Detroit since being traded. Kaline and Cash each hit 2-run
homers off Denny, with Cash adding another pair, one with the sacks full,
in the nitecap.

1978
With Oakland leading the AL Western Division (24-15), manager Bobby Winkles
walks off the job. Jack McKeon takes over, who Winkles succeeded one year
earlier.

the Boston trainer for 8 years.

1979
Ranger Al Oliver hits 3 HRs in a 7-2 win over the Twins at Texas.

will be just 1-3 in pinstripes before being banished to the Mets.

1980
Five hours after the midnight deadline passes, the players and owners
avert a strike by announcing a new 4-year basic agreement. The new deal

contributions to the players' pension fund, but the major issue of free-agent
compensation remains unresolved.

Ferguson Jenkins of the Rangers wins his 250th career game, a 3-1 two-hitter
versus Oakland.

1981

to run Detroit's record to 34-5. Detroit has now won 16 straight on the
road to tie the AL record of the 1912 Senators. The win goes to Dan Petry
(7-1). Losing pitcher is reliever Frank LaCorte, who takes his last ML loss

14 walks - 6 off winning pitcher Jamie Moyer, who allows no runs in 4.1
innings - and strand 17 runners.

1988
Braves manager Chuck Tanner is fired and replaced by Russ Nixon. The Braves
were 12-27 under Tanner, last in the NL West.

Danny Tartabull, who hit an IPHR against Bert Blyleven last October, does

other IPHRs at Minnesota.

1989
Cleveland loses to Detroit, 7-2, to drop its record to 21-22, but remains

season a sub-.500 team has ever been in first place.

1991
Kirby Puckett strokes five singles and a triple in the Twins' 12-inning
10-6 loss to Texas at the Metrodome. It is the second time the outfielder

have accomplished the feat twice. Russell is the winner over Steve Bedrosian.

In front of a sparse Olympic Stadium crowd of 8,833, Tommy Greene, making
his 15th start as a major leaguer, no-hits the Expos, 2-0. The Phillies'
right-hander joined the rotation replacing Danny Cox who had suffered a
pulled groin in his last start. Greene strikes out 10 batters and walks
7 in the contest. The victory gives Greene one fewer career wins (6) than
Nolan Ryan has no-hitters (7).

With his fourth inning swipe of second base at Shea Stadium (off P Ron
Darling and C Rick Cerone), Andre Dawson becomes the third major leaguer
to become a member of the 300/300 club with his 300th stolen base. The
36-year-old Cubs outfielder, who has also hit 354 homeruns, joins Barry
Bonds and Willie Mays in reaching the milestone.

Manager Frank Robinson is fired by the Orioles - the 3rd manager in three
days to get the ax - and replaced by first-base coach Johnny Oates.

Astros still lose to the Reds by a score of 10-5.

1996
In the Red Sox' 11-4 sinking of the Mariners, Roger Clemens tosses a

moves to LF in the 8th inning.

with Hanshin.

1998
Carl Pavano, making his major-league debut for the Expos, allows two
runs one earned on three hits and strikes out six in the 3-2 win over the
Phillies. The Southington, Connecticut native was acquired by Montreal in
the Pedro Martinez trade with the Red Sox.

David Wells extends his American League record consecutive outs streak
to 38 when Boston leadoff man, Darren Lewis, grounds out to start the
game. The Yankee southpaw, who authored a perfect game in last start, had

to the 'perfecto'.

1999
