May 12

1901
The Reds' Noodles Hahn cooks the Pirates, 6-1, allowing 9 hits, one to
each batter.

1903
Mathewson is a stingy host to the Reds, holding them hitless through 7
innings and scoreless through 8 innings. But the Reds score 4 in the 9th
off Matty to beat the Giants, 4-1.

1904
For his second game in three days, Mathewson is shelled in the first inning,
as the Reds tally 4 runs. Umpire Bob Emslie adds some fireworks of his own,
tossing McGraw for too much lip. The Giants tie it in the 3rd, but the
Reds make 13 hits off Matty while the Giants contribute 6 errors. The Reds
win, 13-7.

1908
Orval Overall of the Cubs absorbs his first loss since August 11, 1907,
as the Phils end his 14-game winning streak, 6-2.

1909
The first use of wireless to transmit baseball results is made by the Columbia
University Wireless Club. The proceedings of the game between the University
of Pennsylvania and Columbia were relayed from the Bellevue-Stratford
in Philadelphia to New York's Waldorf Astoria, where students took the
messages. Penn prevails 11-0.

1910
Issuing just one walk which spoils his bid for a perfect game, A's
right-hander Chief Bender, who is part Chippewa, throws a 4-0 no-hitter
at Shibe Park against the Cleveland Naps (Indians). Terry Turner walks in
the 4th off the Chief and then is caught stealing. Bender will be 23-5,
one of only two 20-game-win seasons the future Hall of Famer will have in
15 years. The home plate umpire is Bill Dinneen, who tossed a no-hit game
against the White Sox playing with the Pilgrims (Red Sox) on September 27,
1905, making him the only person in big league history to both throw a
no-hitter and call one as an umpire.

1911
Against the Yankees at Bennett Park, Cobb scores a run from 1st on a short
single to right, scores from 2B on a wild pitch, then doubles home two runs
in the 7th to tie the game. When New York C Ed Sweeney vehemently argues the
call at the plate, the rest of the infield gathers, leaving Cobb unattended
at 2B. With no time out called, Cobb strolls to third base, and then ambles
in to observe the continuing argument. When he spots an opening in the circle
of players, he quickly slides in with the go-ahead run. The Tigers win, 6-5.

1913
Mathewson whips the Cubs, 3-1, allowing just 3 hits and no walks to beat
Lou Richie. Matty has now pitched 45 straight innings without a walk.

1915
White Sox hurler Red Faber hurls only 67 pitches in his complete-game
3-hit 4-1 victory over the Senators. The future Hall of Fame right-hander's
low-pitch count is assisted when he needs to throw only three pitches to
retire the side in both the third and fifth innings.

A's part-time catcher Wally Schang nails an AL-record-tying six would-be
St. Louis base stealers in a 3-0 Browns victory. With Schang sidelined
next month, three A's catchers will again nail six against the White Sox
on June 18th.

At the Polo Grounds, veteran Christy Mathewson wins his 1st, topping the
Reds, 6-5. Gene Dale is the loser.

The New York Yankees top Cleveland 4-2, despite hitting into a triple play.

1916
The Giants top Pittsburgh, 3-2, to sweep the 4-game series. Mathewson shuts
out the Pirates for 5 innings, but Doc Johnson's triple in the 6th helps
tie it at 2-2. Rube Benton relieves Matty and picks up the win when the
Giants score.

The A's and Tigers conclude a weird series with the Tigers winning today, 7-6,
in 11 innings. The A's set a ML record by leaving 17 runners on base in the
first 9 innings, while Detroit strands 13 for a 9-inning record of 30. This
will not be topped this century though it will be tied in games concluded
in 9 innings (this game is not listed in the record books, though it was
acknowledged at the time). For the whole game, the A's leave 20 on base,
while Detroit leaves 16. For the four-game series, the two teams combine
for 85 walks and two HBP, and they combine to leave 92 runners on base.

1919
After a scoreless 12-inning game the day before, the Yankees and Senators
complete 27 innings of action with no decision, going 15 innings in a 4-4
draw. Yankee lead off hitter George Halas goes hitless for the 2nd day in
a row and ends his ML career with just 22 at-bats. He will decide to start
the NFL instead.

1921
At St. Louis, George Kelly hits his 2nd grand slam in 2 weeks to power the
Giants to a 7-5 win over the Cardinals. He'll end up with three for the
year. Slim Sallee is the winner over Bill Sherdel.

1922
At Cincinnati, the Reds' Cliff Markle relieves in the 9th and induces a
ground out on one pitch to Brooklyn's Hy Myers. The Reds then score 2 runs
to give Markle a one-pitch 7-6 win.

1923
P Hollis "Sloppy" Thurston goes from the Browns to the White Sox for cash.

1924
Cincinnati edges past New York into first place in the NL. They'll swap
places until June 13th, when a 5-1 win over the Braves boosts the Cubs into
the top spot.

1925
A record to date 20 HRs are hit in the ML this day. Phils pitcher Jimmy
Ring collects one of them, a grand slam off Pittsburgh's Vic Aldridge in
an 8-5 win before the Pirates win in the second game, 13-8. Kiki Cuyler
scores 5 runs for the Bucs in game 2.

Al Simmons of the A's has a grand slam as well to account for the scoring
in a 4-3 win over Detroit.

1926
Walter Johnson defeats the St. Louis Browns, 7-4. He is now 6-1, but will
lose his next 7 in a row as the Senators go into a tailspin.

1927
Brooklyn P Dazzy Vance collects 4 hits and holds the Reds to the same number,
all doubles, and Brooklyn wins 6-3. The Robins' last run comes on a clean
steal of home by Max Carey.

The Giants edge the Cardinals, 3-2, scoring the winning run in the 11th
when Taylor Douthit drops a fly ball. Starter Pete Alexander is the loser
to Burleigh Grimes. Lester Bell is 0 for 5 with 5 strikeouts for the Birds.

1928
At Boston, the Red Sox score 11 runs in the 3rd inning against the Browns
and roll to a 15-2 win.

1929
With Eppa Rixey on the mound, the Reds win 9-3 over the Braves. Boston
makes 25 assists.

1930
A bad err day for Umpire Brick Owens as he calls 5 balks against Cleveland's
Milt Shoffner - 3 in the 3rd - and 3 against Philadelphia's George
Earnshaw. Philadelphia wins 13-7.

The wind is blowing out at Wrigley Field as Giants P Larry Benton sets
a modern ML record (since tied several times) by surrendering 6 HRs in a
game. Chicago spots New York a 14-0 lead and trails 14-4 when they add 5
runs on 4 HRs in the bottom of the 7th to tie the ML inning-record set in
1884. Clyde Beck drives in 5 runs as he and Cliff Heathcote each have two of
the Cubs' homers. The Giants counter with 3 HRs including one by Benton as
the New Yorkers manage to hold on to win, 14-12. The victory goes to Benton,
but New York will trade him in 10 days.

The Yankees waive pitcher Tom Zachary to the Boston Braves.

1933
The Red Sox pay the Yankees $100,000 for P George Pipgras and rookie SS
Bill Werber.

1936
After the Dodgers beat Dizzy Dean, 5-2, at Ebbets Field, Cardinal captain
Leo Durocher and Casey Stengel agree to meet under the stands and the Dodger
manager gets a cut lip in a brief fight. The fight was the result of much
bickering about calls during the game and some pre-game bantering.

Before a crowd of 700 fans, the Browns snap a 13-game losing streak by beating
the Yankees, 7-0. Journeyman reliever Al "Tommy" Thomas, signed as a free
agent, makes his first start of the year to beat the AL leaders. St. Louis
gets all its runs in the 1st 2 innings off Pat Malone.

Ground crew notches save. At Comiskey Park, a shower with 2 outs in the
3rd inning delays the game 10 minutes. The grounds crew covers the mound
and the batters' boxes for the duration. Then with the sun shining, they
attempt to make the field "playable" by taking rakes and shovels to the
first and third-base lines and end up rendering the field unplayable. The
umpires have no recourse but to call the game, taking Ted Lyons, with a
3-0 deficit, off the hook.

1937
At the Baker Bowl St. Louis OF Joe Medwick tallies 4 extra-base hits:
two HRs-off Claude Passeau and Orville Jorgens - and a pair of doubles -
in a Cards 15-3 win over the Phillies. The Cards collect 20 hits, including
four by Pepper Martin and a round tripper by Brusie Ogrodowski.

Chick Hafey is restored to active duty with the Reds after a 2-year
retirement.

1938

behind Bob Feller's 5 hitter. Gehrig drives in both runs on a 2-run HR.

1940
Behind the six-hit pitching of Red Ruffing, the Yankees beat the Bosox,
4-0, and stop New York's 8-game losing streak. New York (7-14) is still in
last place while Boston (16-6) sits atop the AL.

The Reds (15-4) follow up yesterday's win over St. Louis, with a doubleheader
sweep, winning 7-1 and 13-4. Ival Goodman has a homer in the opener and
three Reds - Frank McCormack, Lonnie Frey and Harry Craft - come through
with circuit clouts in the second game. The Cards help with seven errors
in the two games.

1941
After five undistinguished seasons of being called the Bees, the National
League franchise in Boston is once again known as the Braves. New owners
had hope to change the team's image by renaming the franchise.

Love that home cooking. At Boston, its Lefty against Lefty as Grove stops
the Yankees' Gomez, 6-4, for the southpaw's 20th straight win at Fenway
Park. It is his 295th career victory. Jimmie Foxx helps with a 2-run homer.

1942
At Boston, the Cubs outslug the Braves, 9-8, as rookie Ed Hanyzewski wins
his only game of the year. Bill Nicholson has a 2nd inning homer off loser
Lou Tost, while Braves pitcher Jim Tobin hits a pinch homer.

1944
The Giants purchase 6 foot 9 inch Johnny Gee from the Pirates. Gee has a
ML record of 5-8, but his chief attraction is that he is too tall for the
draft. He will compile a 2-4 record for the Giants.

1946
A crowd of 69,401, the largest in Stadium history, watch the Yankees give
the Red Sox 2 unearned runs and manage just 3 hits off Mickey Harris,
and lose to Boston, 3-1. The Sox gets just 3 hits off loser Spud Chandler.

1947
At Ebbets Field, Brooklyn snaps its losing streak, beating Boston,
8-3. Robinson has a hit and two stolen bases and is leading the NL in
scoring with 20 runs.

1948
At Cincinnati, the Reds score 3 in the 9th but come up short, losing to
Brooklyn, 9-7. Reds starter and loser Johnny Vander Meer doubles in the 5th
and doesn't advance when Glenn Corbitt bounces a single over Billy Cox' head
(as noted by Bill Deane). Reese retrieves the ball and keeps it, pulling
off a hidden ball trick on Vandy when he wanders off 2B. Taking no chances,
the Reds pinch hit for Vandy in the 6th.

1950
Before today's game, Red Sox star Ted Williams apologizes through a front
office statement to the hometown fans for "insulting gestures" he made in
response to catcalls prompted by his 2 errors in a doubleheader loss (13-4
and 5-3) to Detroit yesterday. Williams' 2nd bobble allowed the Tigers
eventual winning run to score. The Sox waive Frank Quinn to the Senators.

The Cubs beat the Pirates, 6-3, using 4 extra base blows in the 4th. Two are
homers, by Preston Ward and Andy Pafko. The Pirates also lose OF Ted Beard,
who breaks his right wrist sliding.

Hans Stoever, pitching for Rochester's (NY) Rush High School strikes out
30 batters in a 12-inning 6-2 win over Scottsville HS. His opponent, Gail
Rhineland, who has only one hand, pitched a no-hitter the previous week.

1951
Although Boston's Dom DiMaggio begins his 27-game hitting streak,
the longest of the season in the AL, with 3 hits against the Senators,
Washington wins 5-4.

In the 2nd game of a double header, Stan Musial, on the Cards bench because
he has flu, pinch hits in the 8th inning and blasts a 3-run homer into the
RF stands at Crosley Field. Teammate Bill Howerton had earlier hit a 2-run
pinch homer, only the 4th time in NL history that two pinch hitters have hit
four-baggers (it will happen 4 more times in the 1950s). The Cards win 8-6,
after dropping the opener, 7-2.

1953
Whitey Ford of the New York Yankees allows only rival pitcher Early Wynn's
infield single in the 6th in beating the Indians 7-0. New York increases
its lead to 2 games over the 2nd-place Indians.

In Boston, P Ellis Kinder walks 2 White Sox batters in the 10th inning,
and they come around to score. The Red Sox lose 9-7, Kinder's first loss to
Chicago after 18 straight victories stretching back to June 24, 1948. His
18 straight wins over one club is a Red Sox record.

After 10 straight losses to Bobby Shantz going back to May 15, 1951, the
Browns top the A's lefty, 7-3. Rookie Don Larsen, with 7+ innings of relief
and an RBI triple, is the winner.

At age 36, Red Sox outfielder Dom "the Little Professor" DiMaggio retires. The
younger DiMaggio hit .294 last year, but had just three pinch-hitting
appearances this year.

who had winning seasons in each of his 3 years with Washington, will post

1954
The Dodgers option LF Sandy Amoros to Montreal because of weak hitting. They
will recall him later in the season.

2-hitter in 10 days.

game-ending homer.

Dodger Gil Hodges' HR in the 5th spoils Lew Burdette's bid for a no-hitter
in the Braves 5-1 win.

Rookie CF Wally Moon of the Cards has his 2nd 5-hit game and scores 5 runs
in a 13-5 rout of Pittsburgh.

In a PCL contest, Oakland's Al Gettel and Hollywood's Bob Hall each pitch
21 innings. Each team scores a run in the first and the Oaks score 4 more
in the top of the 21st to win, 5-1.

1955
After walking the bases full in the bottom of the ninth, Cubs right-hander Sam
'Toothpick' Jones whiffs Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente and Frank Thomas to
preserve his 4-0 no-hitter against the Pirates. Unfortunately only 2,918
fans are on hand at Wrigley Field to witness the first no-hitter ever
thrown by a black player in major league history, and the first no-hitter
in Wrigley Field since the double no-hitter of 1917. The Cubs lace 15 hits
against Nellie King and Vernon Law. TV announcer Harry Creighton joked in
a pre-game interview with Jones that he'd give him a gold toothpick if he
pitched a no-hitter. Creighton keeps his word.

The Braves Gene Conley stops the Dodgers, 2-1, ending Brooklyn's streak
from the start of the season of 25 straight games in which they've led at
some point in the game. The mark will be topped by the 2005 White Sox.

Washington 3B Eddie Yost's streak ends at 838 straight games because of
tonsillitis as teammate Maury McDermott 4-hits the Indians for a 3-0 win.

1956
Carl Erskine tosses his second career no-hitter when he holds the crosstown
rival Giants hitless in the Dodgers' 3-0 victory at Ebbets Field. Two walks

a no-no against the Cubs in 1952.

Don Ferrarese gets his first major league victory blanking the Bronx Bombers
at Yankee Stadium, 1-0. The Orioles rookie southpaw loses a no-hitter when

breaking clout in the 8th gives them a 4-3 win over the O's.

Cincinnati from 6th place to the top of the NL.

1958
Willie Mays hits the first grand slam in the history of the San Francisco
Giants and adds another HR as Los Angeles loses 12-3.

The Reds farm out Vada Pinson, who was in the Cincy starting lineup on

1959
At Yankee Stadium, Yogi Berra's errorless streak of 148 games comes to an
end when he makes an error on his 34th birthday today. Berra also homers,
as do Howard and Mantle, but New York loses 7-6 to the first-place Indians.

neck and shoulder trouble. He is 0 for 5 in Boston's 4-3 loss to Chicago
in 12 innings.

pitch is grand slammed by Averill for a 7-3 Cubs win.

walking 3.

At Wrigley, the Reds sink the Cubs, 14-1, by scoring 7 runs in the first

over the next 7 seasons.

In the Florida State League, Palatka's Michael Mattaice hurls his 2nd
consecutive no-hitter, rolling over Tampa, 20-0. On the 3rd, he beat Daytona
Beach 4-0.

1961
Bill Monbouquette's 17 strikeouts for the Red Sox are a club record and
the most yet by an AL pitcher in a night game. He beats Washington 2-1.

At Minnesota, Angels P Eli Grba hits a 5th-inning solo HR off P Pedro Ramos,
who then returns the favor in the bottom of the inning. Ramos wins 5-4.

stands behind 3B after a drunken fan who has been heckling Rocky's wife and
father. Colavito is ejected, but the Tigers win in the 9th on P Frank Lary's
HR. For Lary, it is his 25th win over the Yankees against just 8 losses.

1962
For a team which has lost 17 of their first 22 games, New York Mets relief
P Craig Anderson wins both games of a doubleheader against the Braves to
go 3-1. The reliever's day of work will amount to 5% of the team's total
victories for the season. He will not win another game in the ML, losing
his next 19 decisions, 16 of them this season. Ninth-inning game-ending
HRs win the games as Hobie Landrith hits one in the opening 3-2 win and
Gil Hodges closes a game-two 9-8 victory. It is the first time in history
that a doubleheader has ended with two walkoff homers. The next will be
July 25, 1967.

Mantle goes 3 for 3 with 3 runs score and a homer to pace New York to a
9-6 victory at Cleveland.

At Crosley Field, the Reds' Joey Jay and the Pirates' Al McBean match goose
eggs for 9 innings before the Bucs push across 2 runs in the 10th. The Reds
come back with 3 runs to win, 3-2. Frank Robinson drives in the winning
run with a single.

1963
At the Polo Grounds, the Mets win a see-saw battle with the Reds, 12-11,
in the nitecap of a doubleheader. The Reds battle back from a 5-0 deficit
in the 3rd to tie the game at 6 apiece in the top of the 5th. The Mets
score 5 runs to go ahead 11-6, but Cincy plates 6 runs in the 6th to go
ahead 12-11. The Mets score twice in the 8th to win. In the opener, the
Reds win, 3-0, on a 3-run inside-the-park homer run by Leo Cardenas. The

1968
Luis Tiant improves his record to 5-2 when he tosses his fourth consecutive
shutout (a club record) blanking the Orioles in the first game of a twin

the season with a 21-9 record, will post a league-leading 1.60 ERA in 34
appearances for the Tribe.

1970
At Wrigley Field only 5,264 fans see Ernie Banks become the 8th member of the
500 HR club, connecting off Pat Jarvis during a 4-3 eleven-inning Cub win
over the Braves. It his 1,600th career RBI. The second-inning line drive,
hit off Braves' pitcher Pat Jarvis into the left-field bleachers, bounces
back onto the field and is given to the Cub first baseman after the ball
is retrieved by Atlanta outfielder, Rico Carty. Frank Secory, an ex-Cub,
is umpiring this game, and he was one of the umpires in the 1953 game in
which Banks hit is first homer. Billy Williams' homer in the 9th ties the
game and Ron Santo's RBI single in the 11th wins it. Atlanta's Rico Carty,
meanwhile, has 3 singles and has hit in 30 consecutive games.

1971
Carl Taylor, after taking himself out of the game in the top of the seventh
inning, goes into the clubhouse in Baltimore and sets fire to his baseball

earlier to get a new left fielder because he was not helping the team
or himself.

1972
The Brewers and Twins go 21 innings before the 1 A.M. curfew halts play with
the score 3-3. They'll pick it up tomorrow. It's not exactly like kissing

an extra-inning game with 7. The Twins tie their club record by stranding 23.

1974
In a 4-3 loss to the Cubs at Wrigley Field, Bronx native Ed Kranepool

eclipsed by the Cards in 1994.

1977
With Benson as manager, the Braves win - finally - beating the Pirates in
Pittsburgh, 6-1. Tomorrow, the team will return home and Benson will return

take the helm. The team will resume their play under Bristol with a shutout
loss to the Cardinals.

1978
At Royals Stadium, a potential game-ending routine flyball to right center
becomes an Amos Otis walk-off inside-the-park homer when Reggie Jackson
and Mickey Rivers collide in the outfield. The misplay turns a sure Goose
Gossage save into a devastating loss for the World Champions Bronx Bombers.

In a 9-3 loss to the Rangers, Orioles outfielder Al Bumbry breaks his leg
sliding into 2B. Except for 5 pinch hitting appearances in September, he
is out for the year. Eddie Murray drives in all the O's runs while Juan

1979
Bill Murray, anchorman on Saturday Night Live Weekend Update reports
42-year-old Chico Escuela (a fictional baseball player portrayed by Garrett

first baseman Steve Garvey into the Dominican's infielder's crotch ends an
inspiring comeback.

Shreveport.

1982
In their 2nd major trade in as many days, the Twins deal C Butch Wynegar
and P Roger Erickson to the Yankees for IF Larry Milbourne, minor leaguers

Griffith, is roundly criticized for the deals, in which he appears to be
unloading high-salaried veterans at the expense of a winning ball club.

The Brewers' Paul Molitor hits 3 solo homeruns, but Milwaukee loses 9-7 to
Kansas City.

1984
Cincinnati's Mario Soto is one out away from a no-hitter when the Cardinals

first at-bat this year, but allows 2 passed balls in the 1st, 3rd and 4th

club in 2000, will not accomplish the feat again during his three seasons
of playing in the desert. Today the Cubs defeat the Diamondbacks, 7-6.

The Padres' home game streak, which started in April of 1983 without a rainout

on May 7 against Florida.

the Boston catcher's mask.

2013

blast off Mike Bolsinger, estimated to have travelled 475 feet, proves to
be the only bright spot in the Marlins' 11-1 loss to LA at Chavez Ravine.
