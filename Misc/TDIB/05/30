May 30

1901
An NL record crowd of 28,500 sees St. Louis beat the Giants, 6-5, in
10 innings in the afternoon game of a split holiday doubleheader at New
York. Christy Mathewson takes the loss in relief after coming on in the
7th with the game knotted at 5 apiece. A passed ball with a runner on 2B
and a sacrifice fly is Matty's undoing. New York wins the A.M. game, 6-4,
in front of 2,500 fans.

The Boston Americans play their first doubleheader, dropping both to Chicago,
8-3 and 5-3.

1902
In front of a Polo Grounds crowd of 26,000, the Phillies sweep two from
the Giants, winning 5-3 and 6-0.

Baltimore's Roger Bresnahan connects for two inside-the-park homers in the
opening 12-4 win against Cleveland. He'll repeat the performance with the
Giants in 1904. Baltimore wins the 2nd game the same way, 10-7.

The Cleveland Blues send Candy LaChance to the Boston Americans for Charlie
Hickman.

1903
In game 2 of a doubleheader in St. Louis, Bill Donovan of the Tigers loses,
5-0 to the Browns' Bill Reidy. The Tigers had scored 62 runs in Wild Bill's
first 7 starts, but he better get used to the goose eggs. He'll start 5 games
in which the Tigers lose, 1-0, lose another by a 2-0 score, and win a 1-0
game. Not until September 3 will the Tigers be shut out in a non-Donovan game.

1904
In an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader in Cincinnati, the first-place Cubs take on the
3rd place Reds, with just a few percentage points separating the team. The
two split the holiday twin bill, the Reds taking the opener 7-4, despite a
9th-inning grand slam by Davey Jones. The Reds then lose, 5-2. Frank Chance
of the Cubs is the real loser as he is hit 3 times by P Jack Harper of the
Reds in the morning game, once reportedly losing consciousness when hit in
the head. He continues to play and in the 2nd game, he is hit once by Win
Kellum, giving him a record 4 hit by pitched balls for the day. (Another
source says Chance was hit 5 times in 1 game.) Carl Lundgren loses the opener,
while the deliberate Bob Wicker takes the night cap. Historian Joe Dittmar
notes that beginning in the 7th inning the Reds fans begin counting aloud
"1, 2, 3, 4 ..." when Wicker receives the ball. The Enquirer reports that
the count would sometimes reach 15 before he would pitch.

1905
Both leagues post record attendance figures for the Tuesday Memorial Day
holiday. Thanks to morning-afternoon doubleheaders, 80,963 attend 8 AL games,
67,806 see 7 NL games. At Chicago, Detroit wins a pair from the White Sox,
1-0 and 3-2. In Cleveland, the visiting Browns are edged twice, 1-0 and 6-5.

The Yankees sell veteran OF John Anderson to Washington.

1906
Chicago Cubs pitcher Jack Pfiester fans 17 Cardinals, but loses, 4-2, in
15 innings at St. Louis. Chicago also loses the nitecap, 6-1, to Carl Druhot.

At Washington Park, the Superbas split with the Giants, winning the first
game, 2-0, behind the 4 hit pitching of Harry McIntire. Dummy Taylor takes
the loss. Mathewson gets a win for New York in the nitecap, beating Bill
Scanlan, 5-2.

1907
In an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader, The Phils edge the Giants in the morning contest
as Lew Moren bests Hooks Wiltse, 5-2. The afternoon match attracts 25,000
to the Polo Grounds, Mathewson scatters 8 hits to beat the Phillies, 6-1.

1908
In the first game of a Memorial Day doubleheader in Boston, Cy Young throws
a near-perfect game, beating Washington, 6-0. Jerry Freeman's 5th inning
single gives Washington its only hit and baserunner. Jesse Tannehill, making
his first appearance since last August, starts for the Sox in game 2, but
he leaves in the 5th inning with a 2-2 score. The Sox later today suspend
him without pay. Tex Pruiett relieves and is less effective than Jesse,
taking the loss in a 7-4 game.

1909
The Pirates come from behind to beat Chicago, 5-4, in the first game of
a DH. In the nitecap, Honus Wagner breaks up a 2-2 tie with a 9th inning
double off Jack Pfiester and the Pirates prevail, 4-2. Pittsburgh now leads
the Cubs by 2 games, and will not lose for another 13 games.

The Cardinals score 11 runs in the first inning against the Reds and win,
12-2.

1910
In an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader with the St. Louis Cardinals at the West Side
Grounds, Chicago takes the morning contest, 6-1, behind Mordecai Brown. Its
Chicago's 11th straight win, but St. Louis stops them in the afternoon, 3-1.

1911
New York takes the NL lead, winning two from Brooklyn. Giants C Art Wilson
makes the first 9 putouts in the morning game as four Superbas fan, three
foul out and two are thrown out at home trying to score on base hits. The
Giants win, 4-1, before 8,000. Before a turnaway crowd of 25,000 in the
nitecap, Bugs Raymond gives up just a single in 5 innings before leaving
with acute stomach pain "just southwest of the fourth rib" (NY Times)
caused by eating a strawberry sundae between games. Red Ames allows two
hits the rest of the way as the Giants whip the Dodgers' Nap Rucker, 3-0.

After one day at the top, the Cubs drop to 3rd, as the Pirates sweep a
pair from Chicago, winning 1-0 and 4-1. But the first game is protested by
Chicago, presumably for batting out of order, and the protest will later be
upheld. All the records including Babe Adams' 4-hit shutout (he'll still
lead the NL with 7) and Honus Wagner's hitless game are tossed. Thanks to
the successful protest, Wagner will end the season at a league-leading .334,
one point ahead of Dots Miller. In the afternoon contest, Howie Camnitz tops
Ed Reulbach, who is drilled for 6 hits and all 4 runs in two innings. Wagner
has a pair of hits in the nitecap.

In the afternoon contest in Boston, Phils rookie Pete Alexander pitches
the 2nd game of a holiday doubleheader, winning 11-4. Philley also wins
the morning game, 3-0, in 10 innings behind Earl Moore's three-hitter.

1912
The Washington Senators buy 1B Chick Gandil for $12,000 and two players from
Montreal of the International League. He is immediately inserted into the
lineup and Washington begins a 17-game winning streak - 16 on the road -
that will be stopped on June 19th.

Three doubleheader sweeps - Chicago Green Sox over Richmond, Virginia
Rebels; Cincinnati over Reading, Pennsylvania; and Pittsburgh Filipinos
over Cleveland - end a short, futile season of the would-be ML competitor,
the United States League. Poorly organized and financed, the season began
May 1st and collapsed largely through the failure of the New York franchise
to attract fans. The Filipinos, so named because old Pittsburgh favorite
Deacon Phillippe was manager, had the best record ... 16-8. Players and
fields were barely above semi-pro level, but promoters will be heard from
again with the advent of the Federal League.

At Philadelphia, the morning game draws 18,000, while 38,000 crowd the
afternoon contest. The Giants win both, 7-1 and 6-1, over the Phils. Marquard
wins the nitecap to run his streak to 10 wins.

The Yankees host the Athletics at the Polo Grounds and lose, 7-1.

1913
In a Memorial Day doubleheader in Washington, Red Sox OF Harry Hooper
hits lead-off homers in both games to help sweep the Senators. Boston wins
the opener, 4-3, then the nitecap, 1-0, on Hooper's leadoff homer against
Walter Johnson. Hooper, a future Hall of Famer, will total just 4 homers on
the season. The next leadoff batter to match Hooper's mark will be Rickey
Henderson in 1993.

The Giants turn away thousands of fans, then turn back the faltering Phillies,
8-6 and 5-1. Rube Marquard wins the first game and Jeff Tesreau takes the
second. Giants RF Red Murray has three hits in game 2 and, for the two
games, turns a unique fielder's cycle, recording assists to 2B and 3B in
game 1 and to 1B and home in game 2. Murray, who led the NL in assists in
1909 and 1910, will record 24 this year.

1914
At St. Louis, the Browns and Tigers combine for just 11 hits in a
doubleheader. Detroit's Harry Coveleskie tosses a one-hitter in the opener
to win, 2-1. The Tigers manage 4 hits off Earl Hamilton. Carl Weilman then
wins for the Browns in the 2nd game, 2-1, outpitching Miles Main. Both
pitchers allow just 3 hits, with Sam Crawford collecting two of the 3 Bengal
bingles. The Tigers miss Ty Cobb, sitting with a cracked rib, who will not
return until June 5th.

In the Federal League, Pittsburgh sweeps a pair from Baltimore, winning 4-2
and 6-5 in 11 innings. The Pittfeds win the nightcap despite Tex McDonald
being caught by the hidden ball trick in the 11th inning. Baltimore 2B Otto
Knabe nabs him.

1916
The Phillies' Al Demeree, an ex-Giant, finally stops the Giants, 5-1, on 6
hits, handing New York its first loss in 18 matches. Giant 3B Bill McKecknie,
obtained from Newark (Federal League) in April, is caught stealing 3 times. In
a raucous game 2, the Giants knock out Pete Alexander in the 7th to win,
10-2. Three Giants - catchers Bill Killifer and Ed Burns, and Dode Paskert -
get tossed by umpire Harrison, which provokes the fans to toss cushions and
bottles at him until he is surrounded by Giants players. He gets a police
escort after the game and stays in the clubhouse for an hour to avoid the
mob. After Burns is ejected, infielder Bobby Byrne goes behind the plate
and throws out two would-be base stealers.

Browns pitcher Earl Hamilton, with 50 wins in the last 4 years but just one
appearance this year, is sold to Detroit. He'll go 1-2, then be waived back
to St. Louis on June 22.

1917
The Yankees shut out the A's, winning the 1st game, 6-0, behind Nick Cullop,
and taking the nitecap, 2-0, behind Slim Love.

1919
In Chicago, the White Sox sweep a pair from Cleveland, winning 4-1 in the
morning behind Red Faber and 3-2 in the afternoon behind Williams. The
nitecap win comes when the Sox score with 2 out in the 9th. In the opener,
CF Happy Felsch, who started a triple play earlier in the week, teams up
with 3B Buck Weaver for a DP. Felsch will start 15 double plays this year,
a ML record for outfielders. At the end of the day, the White Sox lead the
AL by 4 games. They will be overtaken briefly by Cleveland, then the Yankees,
during the next 6 weeks before taking the lead to stay.

The Cards knock out Grover Alexander in the 5th inning of game 1 and beat
the Cubs, 4-1. Alex is now 0-5. The Cards complete the deal with a 4-1
afternoon win behind Goodwin in game 2.

In the first of 2 in Philadelphia, Babe Ruth has 3 hits and pitches the Red
Sox to a 10-6 win over the A's. The Babe homers in game 2 over the RF wall,
the ball landing on top of a roof on 22nd street. The A's win it in the
9th, 4-3.

1920
George Kelly knocks in six runs and Casey Stengel homers as the Giants down
the Phillies 10-6.

1921
The Giants take a pair from the Phillies, 5-1 and 13-7. Before the start of
the afternoon game, a memorial to Captain Eddie Grant, killed in action in
the Argonne Forest October 20, 1918, is unveiled at the Polo Grounds. One
of the speakers is Grantland Rice who reads a poem he has written for the
occasion ...
"Far from the game and the cheering of old,
A cross in the Argonne will tell you the story
Where each one may read on its rain-battered mold
A final box score that is written in glory.
A final box score of a Player who gave
The flag that he fought for, his ghost - and his grave.
Green be his couch where the white lilies lean
Crimson the poppies that keep guard above him.
Gentle the darkness that gathers between
The Player at rest and the torn hearts that love him.
God give him refuge where Life's flag is furled
A dreamer gone back to the dust of the world.
Low be the lost winds of France that must creep
Over his rest in the Last Tavern lying.
Good send Thy dreams where the Darkness is deep,
Father, Thy care when the wild storms are flying.
No monarch there - but the soul of a Man -
We speak for a Brother - for One of the Clan!"

The Red Sox drop a pair to the A's, 8-1 to Perry and 2-1 to Rommel. Red
Sox 1B Stuffy McInnis makes an error, the only one he will make all year,
as he will field .999. Tomorrow he begins an errorless streak of 163 games
and 1,625 chances.

At Chicago the White Sox and Browns combine for 58 hits in a doubleheader,
with St. Louis taking the opener, 14-5, in the morning and the Sox copping
the afternoon game, 8-5. George Sisler scores 5 runs in game 1, then bangs
out a single, two doubles and a homer in game 2.

At Boston, the Braves win 9-3 in the morning and then take 16 innings to
win game 2, 6-5. Leon Cadore takes over the pitching chores in the 2nd
inning of the afternoon game and is the loser. Brooklyn scores in the 14th
on Wally Hood's only ML homer, and score again in the 16th. Each time it is
Ray Powell who answers, singling in the 14th to drive in a run and tripling
in the 16th to tie again, before scoring. Powell will lead the NL in triples
(18) this year.

At Detroit, the Tigers lose the opener, 6-5 to Cleveland, then take game
2 by a 9-5 score as Cobb has 4 hits, including 2 doubles and a homerun.

1922
Between games of the Memorial Day A.M.-P.M. doubleheader, the Cubs swap
OF Max Flack to the Cards for OF Cliff Heathcote. Flack, who lives just 3
blocks from Cubs Park, went home for lunch between games, and arrived back
in the Cubs clubhouse to find that he'd been traded. The players, who both
played in the morning game, trade uniforms and play for their new teams in
the afternoon. Heathcote is 0 for 3 as a Card, 2 for 4 as a Cub. Flack is
hitless in the first game and 1 for 4 in the 2nd, as the Cubs win both, 4-1
and 3-1. George Stueland wins the opener and Vic Aldridge is the winner in
the afternoon. In the nitecap, Cubs SS Charlie Hollocher strikes out for
the first time this year, on a Bill Doak spitter. A .304 career hitter,
he will whiff 5 times in 1922. In 3 years he will fan 33 times in 372 games.

With the score at 8-8 in the bottom of the 10th inning in game 2 of a
Giants-Phils twin bill at the Baker Bowl, C Butch Henline bats with Cy
Williams on 1B and Curt Walker on 3B. Henline lines an apparent 3-run HR
into the LF stands, and Walker scores the winning run. Henline reaches
2B before heading for the CF clubhouse, but as Williams had not scored at
that point, Henline is credited with just a double, making the final score
9-8. The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin noted that, "It would have been a
homerun if Henline had completed the circuit, but they were serving ice
cream and frankfurters in the clubhouse and when he reached second base
his feet naturally strayed through center field."

George Burns, now a member of the Reds, steals home against the Pirates
in the 3rd on the front end of a double steal with Greasy Neale. It is
his 28th career steal of home and gives him a new NL record formerly held
by Honus Wagner. The Reds win the opener, 9-3, then lose game 2, 7-3,
to Johnny Morrison.

Playing without Heilmann and Cobb, the Tigers down the Browns, 6-5, in
the A.M. game. The Browns' Urban Shocker then allows just one run in 14
1/3 innings before he and Tobin are tossed out of the game for protesting
umpire Owens' ball and strike calls. Tobin's argument gets him a week's
suspension. The Browns win, 2-1, in the 16th on catcher Pat Collins'
single. Hub Pruett picks up the win, striking out 4 of the last 5 batters.

1923
After playing before the NL's biggest crowd (41,000) in the P.M. game of
the holiday twin bill split against Brooklyn, the Giants head west with a
4-game lead over the Pirates. Five regulars will bat over .300, and three
will top 100 RBI, led by NL leader Irish Meusel's 125. At 3B, rookie Travis
Jackson takes over for gimpy Heinie Groh. With 5 future Hall of Famers in
the lineup and 8 on the roster during the season, the Giants will be the
first team to hold first place from opening to closing day and the only
NL team to have done it. With average pitching, they win just 95 games,
but it's enough for a 4 1/2 game margin over the Reds.

In the 1st of 2 games in New York, Ruth's homer in the 1st inning off Walter
Johnson propels the Yankees to a 6-4 win over Washington. Herb Pennock is
the winner.

1925
Between games today, Rogers Hornsby is named manager of the Cardinals by
Sam Breadon, replacing Branch Rickey, who remains as general manager. An
angry Rickey will sell his shares in the team to Hornsby. St. Louis, in
last place, drops two games to Pittsburgh, losing 4-1 in the morning and
15-5 in the P.M. contest, despite two homers by the new manager. Playing
in front of an overflow crowd at spacious Forbes Field, the Pirates set
a modern NL record by stroking 8 triples in the 2nd game; the Cards tally
one for a combined record-tying 9 triples. The normal rules about balls hit
into the crowds being ground-rule doubles is expanded to make them triples
today ... eight of the three-baggers are ground-rule triples.

For the first time in ML history, two pinch hitters hit homers as Phillie
subs Jimmie Wilson and Hal Carlson connect off the Giants' Jack Bentley in
game 2. The Phils win the opener, 7-4 before losing 14-5.

Former Red Sox 20-game winner Hugh Bedient ends his pro career in an unusual
way (as noted by Greg Peterson). Pitching for Atlanta against the hometown
Memphis Chicks, the 2-0 Bedient becomes upset by the ump's decision. The
Memphis fans shower the field with bottles, cushions and programs and the
upset umpire then forfeits the game to Atlanta. Bedient's pro career ends
shortly after the game.

1927
Finally making his first appearance of the season after recovering from
a broken foot sustained in spring training, Walter Johnson hurls the last
shutout of his career, No. 110, winning 3-0 over Boston. Johnson faces just
29 batters, giving up 3 hits. The Senators take the 2nd game of the holiday
twinbill, 10-5, behind recruit Bump Hadley.

Unassisted triple plays are a rarity, but SS Jimmy Cooney makes one for the
Cubs against Pittsburgh in the opener of the Memorial Day doubleheader. He
catches Paul Waner's line drive, steps on 2B to retire Lloyd Waner and tags
Clyde Barnhart going back to 1B. Paul Waner still collects 3 hits and 2
RBIs, but the Cubs win 7-6 in 10 innings to snap the Pirates' 11-game win
streak. The Bucs win the nitecap, 6-5, in 10 innings as Lloyd Waner has 7
hits for the day.

Reading, PA, managed by Fred Merkle, defeats Baltimore in the International
League to break its 32-game losing streak.

1930
With 2 on base in game one, Del Bissonette, Brooklyn 1B, hits the ball over
the RF screen at Ebbets Field, but baserunner Babe Herman, "the Headless
Horseman of Ebbets Field," stops to watch and is passed by Bissonette,
reducing the HR to a single. Despite this, the Robins win a pair of games
from the Phillies, 11-1 and 11-9, and take over first place. Unfazed,
Herman will pull off the move again on September 15th. In the nitecap,
Bissonette collects 5 hits, including a homer. Chuck Klein homers in each
game for the Phils to bring his total to 13.

Senators junkballer Ad Liska leads 6-3 over the A's with 2 outs in the
9th inning when his catcher Muddy Ruel neglects to chase a pop up that
could have made the 3rd out. Two singles and a homer by Al Simmons knots
the game. Simmons then doubles in the 13th, and scores the winning run
as the A's win, 7-6. Having hurt his knee in a rundown, Simmons sits for
the nitecap. But with the bases jammed in the 5th inning of the nitecap,
and the A's down 7-3, Simmons hobbles to the plate to hit a pinch grand
slam off Bump Hadley to help the A's to a 15-11 win. Simmons later tells
John Carmichael this was his greatest game.

The Yankees trade 2 stars of the 1927 team, Waite Hoyt and Mark Koenig,
to the Tigers for Ownie Carroll (0-5) and Harry Rice. Hoyt's departure
follows an argument with manager Bob Shawkey.

The Cubs' Rogers Hornsby, already limping after off-season surgery on his
heel, breaks an ankle sliding into 3B in the first game of a doubleheader
in St. Louis. The Cubs win both games, 2-0 and 9-3, to move into 3rd place,
but Hornsby will miss most of the season.

1931
The Cards retake first place and hold it the rest of the season, as they
win a Memorial Day doubleheader from the Reds and the Giants lose a pair to
Brooklyn. In the 2nd game at the Polo Grounds, Robins 3B Wally Gilbert has
6 consecutive hits but falls one short of the ML record held by his manager,
Wilbert Robinson. The Robins' Gordon Slade adds a grand slam in the sweep.

Despite the Baker Bowl's reputation as a HR haven, no one had hit a ball
over the stadium wall since 1922. But Wally Berger, Boston Braves slugger,
clears it in a 10-9 loss to the Phillies.

At Boston, the A's score 5 runs in the top of the 12th to break a scoreless
tie. Lefty Grove goes the distance in beating the Red Sox, 5-0.

1932
A plaque in memory of Miller Huggins, former Yankee manager, is dedicated
at Yankee Stadium, the first of an array of monuments erected in the
ballpark. The Yanks then sweep the Red Sox, 7-5 and 13-3 to increase their
lead to 5 games over Washington.

At Cleveland, the Tribe takes a pair from the White Sox, 12-6 and
12-11. Afterwards, Chicago claims the umpire George Moriarty deliberately
made wrong calls and the ump fights with four of the Sox players under
the stands. Moriarty, a former White Sox player, breaks his fist knocking
down pitcher Milt Gaston, but he is pummeled by manager Lew Fonseca and
catchers Charlie Berry and Frank Grube. The ump ends up in the hospital
while Fonseca and three players will receive fines for the fight. Will
Harridge will suspend Gaston for 10 days, fine him $500 and rebuke Moriarty.

1933
Boston's Dale Alexander suffers a career-ending injury when he twists his knee
sliding into home in the 2nd game of a doubleheader loss to the A's. The first
baseman will undergo a new therapy, diathermy, which will lead to 3rd degree
burns, gangrene and the near loss of his leg. Last year's batting champ will
hit just .281 this year and retire with a career mark of .331. The A's win,
7-3, behind the relief win of Lefty Grove, then 11-8 in 12 innings, with Grove
throwing scoreless 10th and 11th innings. Brown goes all the way for the Sox
before tiring and walking three, and giving up a pair of singles in the 12th.

Detroit OF John Stone is the first major leaguer to collect 6 long hits in
a regulation length doubleheader, as he bangs out 4 doubles and two homers
for Detroit in a split with the Browns. National leaguers Chick Hafey and
Mel Ott have collected 6 long hits, but their games ran more than regulation
length. The Tigers take the opener, 8-6, then drop the 2nd game, 3-1.

1934
In the first game of a double header, Ben Chapman breaks up Earl Whitehill's
no-hitter in the bottom of the ninth inning at Yankee Stadium. Last season,
the Bronx Bomber left fielder, after being provoked, hit the right-hander
with a punch in the passageway causing a melee between the two teams that
resulted in a 20-minute delay of the game before the police could restore
order. Lefty Gomez takes the loss in today's first game, 1-0. In the nitecap,
Yankee reliever Burleigh Grimes pitches the last 4 innings to pick up his
269th win, 5-4, in 11 innings. It is his first AL appearance and the last
win for the Cooperstown-bound Grimes as well as the last legal win by
a spitballer.

Cleveland 1B Hal Trosky hits 3 successive HRs in the 2nd game of a Memorial
Day doubleheader against the White Sox as Cleveland sweeps a pair, 7-5 in 10
innings and 5-4. His first two are hit off Les Tietje, and the last off Bill
Gallivan. Trosky will homer again tomorrow in a 12-5 loss to the Pale Hose.

A record crowd of 41,000 jams Ebbets Field for a doubleheader with the
Giants. New York manager Bill Terry, who earlier in the year had wisecracked,
"Brooklyn? Are they still in the league?" proved correct. New York sweeps both
games, 5-2 and 8-6, to raise their season record to 6-0 vs. the Dodgers. New
York will move into 1st place the following week. Giants SS Travis Jackson
has only one chance in 18 innings.

Minor leaguer Lou Frierson strokes 5 successive HRs for Paris (West Dixie
League) in a 17-12 loss to Jacksonville. He drives in 8 runs.

1935
The Memorial Day twin bill at the Polo Grounds breaks all NL attendance
records when 63,943 see the Giants take a pair from the Dodgers, 8-3 and
6-0. Thousands are turned away and the gates are closed 40 minutes before
game time. Roy Parmelee coasts in the opener after Mel Ott hits a grand
slam in the first inning. In his first appearance at the Polo Grounds as
a Giant, Al Cuccinello also homers in the same inning. Fred Fitzsimmons
twirls a 2-hitter in the nitecap.

Babe Ruth plays only the first inning of the opener of a doubleheader between
Boston and Philadelphia at the Baker Bowl, going 0 for 1. It is his final
ML appearance. The Phils win, 11-6 and 9-3. On June 2, the former Yankees
superstar will announce his retirement from baseball.

Joe Medwick has 3 doubles and a triple in the first game, a 12-5 Cards win
over the Reds. The Cards take the second game, 4-2, as Medwick contributes
another 2 doubles and a single. His six long hits for the afternoon is the
3rd time it has happened in the NL.

The Yankees move into first place in the AL with a double win over the
Senators, 4-0 and 9-3. Vito Tamulis pitches his 2nd straight shutout in
the lidlifter.

1936
At Yankee Stadium, a crowd of 71,000 watch the Bronx Bombers sweep the
Nats, 7-1 and 6-1. DiMaggio has 3 doubles in the nitecap in support of Red
Ruffing's 2 hitter.

1937
At Boston, Senators pitcher Pete Appleton pitches and bats his way to an
11-4 win over the Sox. Appleton drives in 6 runs, hitting a single and
triple with the sacks full in the 2nd and 3rd, and going 4 for 5, to beat
Fritz Ostermueller. Appleton's RBI mark ties the ML record for pitchers
that Vic Raschi will top (7 - August 4, 1953). Wes Ferrell did it last year.

Led by Hank Greenberg and Gee Walker, the Tigers collect 20 hits in pasting
the Browns, 18-3. Greenberg is 5 for 5 with 2 homers, and Walker also has
2 homers in 4 hits while driving in 7 runs. Rookie George Gill is the winner.

1938
The largest crowd in Yankee Stadium history, 83,533, sees Red Ruffing end
Lefty Grove's 8-game winning streak in a 10-0 victory over the Red Sox. Six
thousand fans are turned away, and 511 are given refunds because there is
no place to sit. The Yankees also took the 2nd game of the doubleheader,
5-4, in a game made famous for a fight between Yankee OF Jake Powell
and Boston player-manager Joe Cronin. The brawl starts when Boston P
Archie McKain hits Powell with a pitch in the stomach. Powell's charge
to the mound is intercepted by Cronin and the two pummel each other for
2-3 minutes. Cronin and Powell are ejected but continue the fight in the
area beneath the stands, until they are separated by Yankee players. Both
players are fined and suspended for 10 days.

Rudy York hits his 3rd grand slam of the month, as the Tigers beat the
Browns, 10-9, in the first game of a holiday pair. York will slam 5 this year.

1939
In an attempt to spruce up their appearance, NL umpires wear white gabardine
trousers with blue jackets.

Pittsburgh's Johnny Rizzo drives in 9 runs, a Pirate record, to give the
visiting Pirates a 14-8 victory over St. Louis in game 2. Rizzo includes
homers in the 5th, off Clyde Shoun, and in the 9th, off Bob Bowman, in the
barrage. The Cardinals win the opener, 7-2.

At Cincinnati, Cubs Larry French and Vance Page fire shutouts as the Cubs
win, 6-0 and 2-0. Whitey Moore loses the opener, while Bucky Walters drops
the nitecap.

At Boston, the Red Sox and Yankees split a Memorial Day doubleheader. The
Sox double the Yanks, 8-4 in the opener, before the New Yorkers roar back
to win the nitecap, 17-9. Ted Williams hits a long HR off Red Ruffing,
that, after retirement, he says it is hardest hit ball he ever had.

1940
The Giants sweep the Dodgers, 7-0 and 12-5 in 12 innings, dropping Brooklyn
out of 1st place. In the opener, Carl Hubbell uses just 81 pitches and gives
up only a 2nd inning single to Johnny Hudson, who is erased on a DP. Only
Lavagetto gets to a 3-2 count. Bill Lohrman wins the 2nd game in 12 innings.

1941
With Brooklyn 3 games in back of the Cards, 59,487 jam the Polo Grounds to

5 runs in the 9th and win 6-2.

The Red Sox and Yanks split, New York winning the opener and Boston
trouncing New York in the nitecap, 13-0. The Sox cap it off with a triple
steal. Williams laces 6 hits in the doubleheader, while Joe DiMaggio hits
in both games to run his streak to 16. It is not a good day for the DiMag,
suffering from a cold, as he commits an error in the opener and 3 more in
the nitecap.

The Cards run their win streak to 11 in a row by defeating the Reds, 4-1,
in the opener. The Reds win game 2 by a 3-2 score.

in the 8th inning of game 2.

1943
With contests played in Rockford (Illinois) and Racine (Wisconsin), the
All-American Girls Professional Baseball League begins the first season of
its 12-year existence. The original AAGBL four-team circuit, which also
includes the war-production cities of Kenosha (Wisconsin) and South Bend
(Indiana), will attract 176,612 baseball enthusiasts during the league's
inaugural season.

The Cubs play 32 games before hitting a homerun, but today Bill Nicholson
hits the two Cubs blasts of the year, both two-run homers, against the
Braves' Al Javery. His first homer, in the 4th inning, comes in the club's
1,120th at-bat of the season. The Cubs win, 5-1, with Paul Derringer the
victor. The 2nd game is postponed.

The Red Sox are also having trouble hitting the major league's balata ball,
as Jim Tabor hits the first Sox homer at Fenway Park in a DH sweep of
the Tigers. The Bosox win, 3-0, behind Dick Newsome, and 5-1 behind Lou
Lucier. In 33 games, the only other Boston homers are Leon Culberson's
dinger in Detroit on the May 23, and Bobby Doerr's inside-the-park liner
at Washington on May 15th.

1944
Dizzy Trout leads off the bottom of the 9th with a game ending HR to win
his own game as the Tigers beat the Yankees 2-1. Hal Newhouser finishes
off the nightcap with a complete-game, 4-1 win.

Mel Ott hits 3 HRs, as the Giants sweep two from the Cubs, 6-5 and 5-4.

1945
Before the biggest Wrigley crowd - 42,565 paid - in 7 years, the Giants top
the host Cubs, 8-6 in the opener, and Mel Ott passes Honus Wagner's career
total of 4,888 total bases to set an NL record. Wagner's has since been
adjusted to 4868 and both players' totals have been passed. Slim Emmerich
is the winner over Ray Prim. The Cubs take the nitecap, 11-2, behind Bob
Chipman's 3-hit win over Bill Voiselle. Andy Pafko clouts a 3-run homer in the
3rd. It's Voiselle's 2nd straight pounding after winning his first 8 games.

1946
In a play that anticipates a scene in The Natural by Brooklyn-native Bernard
Malamud, the Braves' Bama Rowell smashes a double in the 7-run 2nd inning
of the second game of a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The ball shatters the
Bulova clock high atop the right-field scoreboard at 4:25 P.M. (making the
left-fielder the first major leaguer to reach the famous landmark), showering
glass down on the Dodgers' RF Dixie Walker. An hour later the clock stops. The
Braves win 10-8 after being shut out 5-0 by Kirby Higbe in the opener.

The Red Sox sweep two from the Senators, winning 6-5 and 7-2. Joe Dobson
and Mickey Harris are the winning pitchers.

At Wrigley, the Reds lose the first game, 6-1, then in game 2 overcome a
6-1 deficit to down the Cubs, 7-6. Cincy scores 6 runs in the 9th, climaxed
by a 2-run homer by Ray Mueller.

1947
In the first of two, Earl Torgeson of the Braves does not record a single
putout at 1B, a record of idleness shared in the NL by Rip Collins (twice)
and Dolf Camilli of the Phillies in 1937. Later Gary Thomasson and Len
Matuszek will have zero putouts in a full game at 1B. Torgy does have one
chance, but muffs a popup. Torgeson scores a pair as Warren Spahn wins
his 8th in a row, 6-3. Red Barrett then shuts out the Dodgers in game 2,
3-0, dropping Brooklyn to 4th place. The Braves pull off a double steal in
each game, and each time it is Stanky's high throw to the plate that allows
it. Boston is now in 3rd place, a game behind the Giants.

The Giants cop a pair from the Phils, 7-1 and 5-3. Monty Kennedy allows just
4 hits in the first game, while Dave Koslo is the winner in game 2. Koslo,
backed by two-run homers from Bobby Thomson and Joe Lafata, hands Schoolboy
Rowe his first loss after 6 wins.

A's pitchers Dick Fowler and Joe Coleman stop the Yankees, recording
2 shutouts over New York, 1-0 and 4-0. Spud Chandler loses the opener,
despite allowing three hits. Bill Bevens drops the nitecap, walking Coleman
to force in a run and giving up a roundtripper to Eddie Joost. Joost scores
a pair in the nitecap, and the lone run in the opener.

Before a crowd of 56,367, the first-place Tigers split a pair with the
Browns to move to 3 games ahead of Cleveland. Detroit wins the lidlifter,
2-1, as Hal Newhouser scatters 5 hits, but Nelson Potter tops Virgil Trucks,
8-3, to take the nitecap. Tiger rookie Johnny McHale accounts for all 3
runs in game 2 with a pair of homers.

1948
The Reds beat the Cubs and Johnny Schmitz, 6-1, as Grady Hatton's grand slam
in the 8th accounts for the first score for Cincy. The Reds take game 2, 8-3.

1949
Jackie Robinson hits a 13th-inning HR to give the Dodgers a 2-1 game one
win at the Polo Grounds. The Giants take the nitecap, 7-4, and the Leo
Durocher-Robinson feud is fueled when Robby steals second during a timeout
for a pitching change. He has to return to first and Leo gives him the
"swollen head" gesture.

1950
The Dodgers' Duke Snider hits 3 consecutive HRs in the 2nd-game 6-4 win of a
doubleheader sweep of the Phils at Ebbets Field. His 4th drive hits the top
of the RF screen and he is held to a single. Brooklyn wins the a.m. game,
7-6 in 10 innings. Konstanty takes the loss in relief of Robin Roberts.

The Cards sweep a pair from Pittsburgh with Gerry Staley winning both
games in relief, 17-13 and 8-5. The Cards explode in the 8th in both games,
plating 7 in game 1 and 6 in game 2. Staley also won a pair in 1948, the
first reliever to ever accomplish the feat twice. For the Bucs, Fernandez
hit HRs in the 8th and 9th of game 1. In game 2, Musial has his only hit
in 10 at-bats today when he hits a 9th-inning liner for an inside-the-park HR.

1951
In a doubleheader loss to Boston, Yankee slugger Mickey Mantle strikes
out 3 times in the opener, and twice more to start the 2nd game. Stengel
lifts the slugger in the middle of the game for Cliff Mapes. In the opener,
Ted Williams scores from 2B on a sacrifice bunt, and then ties the game
with a HR. Vern Stephens' 15th-inning homer off Specs Shea wins it for
Boston, 11-10. Williams then ties the nitecap with a double and Stephens'
single drives him home with the game winner as Boston triumphs, 9-4. Ray
Scarborough and Bill Wight are today's winners. The loss drops the Yanks
into 2nd place, where they'll stay for a month.

The first place White Sox beat the Browns, 5-2 behind Billy Pierce. But in
game 2, Randy Gumpert (3-0) stops Chicago's 4-game winning streak, beating
the Sox, 8-1. Gumpert has 2 hits and 2 runs batted in. Widmar is the loser.

1952
At New York, Mantle's homer in the 3rd is all the scoring the Yanks can
muster against Bobby Shantz, as the "Mighty Molecule" strikes out 11 on
Memorial Day. Mantle doubles off Shantz in the 14th, but the A's hold on
for a 2-1 victory. Dave Philley knocks home the winner. In game 2, Bob
Hooper loses a shutout with 2 outs in the 9th, but wins, 4-2.

The Senators and Red Sox split a pair, Washington taking the opener,
5-2, and Boston the nitecap, 5-3. Ferrick beats Kinder in game 1 behind
Yost's 3-run homer, while in game 2 Mel Parnell wins his 17th in a row
against Washington. Parnell last lost to Washington on May 28, 1948. Kinder
(vs. Chicago) and Parnell are tied for the Red Sox record for consecutive
wins against an opponent, but Kinder will move ahead on June 1. The Senators
will run up a streak of their own winning their next 9 vs. Boston.

Over the protests of manager Paul Richards, White Sox GM Frank Lane
swaps fleet CF Jim Busby, along with Mel Hoderlein, to Washington for Sam
Mele. Busby's loss leaves a defensive hole in the outfield, which the Sox
will fill when they acquire Jim Rivera in July.

In front of 35,999 at Wrigley, Big Bob Rush shuts out the Reds on 2 hits and
the Cubs light up Bud Byerly and Joe Nuxhall for 15 hits and 11 runs. Dee
Fondy has a double and triple to drive home 3 runs. Rush walks none, strikes
out ten, and does not give up a hit until Grady Hatton doubles with 2 out
in the 7th. He has now pitched 29 straight scoreless innings on his way to
32 scoreless innings, and a 7-0 record, between May 3 and June 4. He's 5-0
for May.

In a Memorial Day doubleheader in St. Louis, 13,000 fans at Sportsman's Park
cheer as the Browns split a pair with Chicago. Satchel Paige (4-1) picks
up a 3-2 win in the opener over Virgil Trucks (0-5), and Dizzy Trout (1-5)
pitches 3 2/3 innings of scoreless relief as Chicago wins in 12 innings, 8-5.

1953
Boston and Washington split a doubleheader, with Boston taking the opener,
4-3. Maurie McDermott wins his 5th game in the opener, though he goes 0
for 3 while batting 6th. The Senators take the nitecap, breaking a 1-1 9th
inning tie when Wayne Terwilliger's pop fly with the bases loaded falls in
front of CF Jimmy Piersall for an error. The Senators win, 2-1. Attendance
is 16,000 as baseball draws 175,000 total today.

1954
At Boston, Mickey Mantle belts his 2nd homer in two days to tie the game
at 1-1 in the 6th. But that's all the scoring off Willard Nixon as the Red
Sox win, 3-1.

Ex-outfielder Hal Jeffcoat (2-0) makes his first mound start and gains a 7-5
win over the Reds at Wrigley. He goes 8 innings and gives up 4 hits before
leaving because of a blister on his finger. Cincy wins the nitecap, 6-5,
in a game called after 8 innings because of darkness. They score 3 in the 8th.

Gil Hodges, given a 2nd chance when Lockman drops his foul pop, belts a 3-run
inside-the-park homer in the 1st to lead the Dodgers to a 5-3 victory over
the host Giants. Campanella, out of action since May 4 with a wrist injury,
is 0 for 4.

Baltimore snaps its 10-game losing streak by snapping the White Sox'
8-game winning streak, 5-2. Jim Fridley and Eddie waitkus homer to back
Don Larsen's win.

The Senators and A's split a pair, with the Nats taking the opener, 6-0,
behind the pitching of Muary McDermott, who bats 6th. He goes 0 for 4,
but Wayne Terwilliger, the 9th hitter, homers in the 9th. Jim Busby scores
on 3 errors ... he reaches base on an E by Jim Fionigan, steals 2B and
Billy Shantz' throw goes into the OF. Vic Power's relay throw goes into
the grandstand. Mickey Vernon has a homer in both games for Washington,
which loses the nitecap, 6-5, on Ed McGhee's pinch double with the bases
loaded in the 9th inning.

1955
For the 2nd time this season, Dodger ace Don Newcombe homers twice in the
same game, posting his 8th straight win, beating Pittsburgh, 8-3. The Brooks
win the opener, 8-4, behind Russ Meyer. Newk gives up 12 hits but fans 9
and starts 2 DPs.

Senators P Mickey McDermott beats the Yankees, 3-2, with a pinch-hit single
in the 10th.

Cubs rookie slugger Bob Speake homers in both games of a double header against
the Cards to finish the month with 10 homers. His homer breaks a 3-3 tie in
the 11th inning of the nightcap to help the Cubs sweep in St. Louis, 9-5
(10 innings) and 4-3 (11 innings). Paul Minner and Howie Pollet are the
winners for Chicago, while Brooks Lawrence and Bobby Tiefenauer take the
losses. Speake will hit just 2 more homers the rest of the season. In game
2, the Cards get stopped in the 9th by an interference call. Moon, attempts
to steal 3B but C Harry Chiti's throw hits the bat of Red Schoendienst. Red
is called out and Moon must return to 2B. Musial then grounds out.

The Orioles waive Bob Kennedy to the White Sox.

1956
At Yankee Stadium, Billy and his brothers attend their first big league
game with their dad, Jack Crystal. The future entertainment superstar, who
will write and perform a one-man play about his father and develop a movie
script about the 1961 Yankees, tremendously enjoys watching his beloved
Bronx Bombers sweep a mid-week doubleheader from the Senators, 4-3 and
12-5. In the 2nd game Mantle tags a pitch from Camilo Pascual that comes
within 18 inches of leaving Yankee Stadium, something never accomplished
by any major leaguer. The ball was still climbing when it caromed off the
upper-stand facade, about 396 feet from home plate. Estimates are that the
ball could have traveled more than 600 feet. It is Mantle's 20th HR of the
season; no one else has ever hit 20 HRs before June. Mantle also homers in
the opener, off Pedro Ramos, with 2 on.

The wind is still blowing out at Wrigley as Braves Eddie Mathews, Hank
Aaron and Bobby Thomson hit consecutive first-inning HRs against the Cubs'
Russ Meyer. Meyer then hits the next batter, Billy Bruton, with a pitch, and
when Bruton charges the mound, both he and Meyer are ejected in the ensuing
fight. The Cubs plate 3 in the 1st and reliever Turk Lown homers in the 2nd
for his first ML roundtripper. Thomson adds another HR, but the Braves lose
the first game 10-9. They hold on to win the 2nd, 11-9. Fifteen HRs in the
2 games, including four by Thomson, sets a ML-record in a doubleheader. All
but 3 of the homers are solo.

1957
Before a crowd of 40,944 at Briggs Stadium, the Tigers sweep a pair from
the A's, winning 6-5 and 3-2. Pitcher Lou Sleater wins the opener with his

but homers by Gus Zernial and Mickey McDermott gave the A's a 5-3 lead
going into the 9th. Bolling has a pair of homers in the nitecap.

back with Banks in the 4th and Tanner in the 7th, and his 2-run HR in the
9th tags Koufax with his 1st loss.

1959
Ted Williams celebrates his 20th season by clouting a dramatic HR in an
8-3 Boston win in a doubleheader nitecap against Baltimore. The Sox were

year. The Sox take the opener, 5-4, after spotting the O's a 4-1 lead.

1960
At the Stadium, the Yanks earn a split with the Senators when, in game 2,
Yogi Berra belts a two-run homer in the 8th inning. When Mantle makes a
catch for the final out, he is surrounded by a group a fans, one of whom
punches him in the face as he races for the dugout. Because of the incident,
the Yankees announce that ushers using ropes - a tactic used at one point
with DiMaggio - will escort Mantle off the field.

1961
3B Gene Freese hits 2 HRs, and Joey Jay and the Reds both win their 6th
straight game, 8-7. Cincinnati completes a sweep of Los Angeles, moving
into a first-place tie with the Giants. Cincinnati will spend the rest of
the season in first place.

Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, and Moose Skowron each belt 2 HRs, tying the
ML record for most players (one club) with multiple HRs in a 9-inning
game. Berra adds a homer as New York wins at Fenway Park 12-3.

to a game-ending triple play. Cards pitcher Dick Hughes retires the first
21 batters before the Reds score a pair in the 8th on 3 hits. With Cards
on 1st and 2nd in the 9th with no outs, Phil Gagliano hits a grounder to SS
Carenas who starts a 6-4-3 for two outs; Orlando Cepeda, running hard from 2B,
tries to score and Deron Johnson's throw to Johnny Edwards completes the TP.

Yankee Whitey Ford, nearing 41, announces his retirement from baseball
because of an elbow injury. His final appearance was a start in Detroit on

with 236 career wins and only 106 losses for a .690 percentage. He played
in only 7 games this season.

1968

suffered a brain clot and needed 2 operations. He recovered sufficiently
to try umpiring again.

42. Burke, thought to be the originator of the "high five," was the only
former major league player to have admitted to being gay, though it was
well-known during his playing.

1997
The Orioles' Mike Mussina retires the first 25 Indian batters before Sandy
Alomar ruins his no-hit bid with a one-out single in the 9th. Mussina then
strikes out the final two batters for a 3-0 victory.

Give it to me one Mo time. Mo Vaughn goes 4 for 4 and slugs 3 HRs in Boston's
10-4 win over the Yankees.

1998
In an emotional on-the-field ceremony, Dan Quisenberry becomes the sixteenth
member of the Royals Hall of Fame. The sinkerball pitcher with a submarine
delivery was diagnosed with a grade IV malignant astrocyma and underwent
brain surgery to remove the tumor in January.

Mark McGwire hits his 27th homerun to establish a major league record for the
most homers hit before the month of June. Last season, Ken Griffey Jr set the
previous mark with 24 round trippers in the first two months of the season.

1999
The Devil Rays score 8 runs in the 4th inning on the way to a 15-7 victory
over the Mariners.

2001
After ending a streak of five straight losses to the Yankees, Red Sox ace
Pedro Martinez makes light of the Curse of the Bambino by suggesting someone
should wake up the Babe so he could drill him with a pitch. Boston will not
beat the Bronx Bombers again during their final seven meetings of the season.

At Pac Bell, it takes 5 hours 53 minutes and 18 innings for the Diamondbacks
to defeat the Giants, 1-0. Erubiel Durazo's double plating Steve Finley
accounts for the game's only run.

Barry Bonds hits career homer No. 522 passing Willie McCovey and Ted Williams
to move up to #11 on the all time list, and making him the number one lefty
homerun hitter in National League history. The round tripper is the 17th
hit by the Giant outfielder in May breaking the record set by Mickey Mantle
(1956) and Mark McGwire (1998).

The Expos fire manager Felipe Alou, their skipper since May of 1992. Owner
Jeffrey Loria says the team has been underperforming and needs a change. The
new manager is his long-time friend Jeff Torborg, who is also an old friend
of Alou's. The 66-year-old Alou, with the Expos organization for 27 years,
turned down the job of managing the Dodgers after the 1997 season to stay
in Montreal. A year later he called that a big mistake.

2003
At Shea Stadium, the Braves go deep four times off former teammate Tom
Glavine to tie a National League record by hitting 55 homeruns in a calendar
month. The New York Giants (July, 1947) and the Cardinals (April, 2000) are
the other teams to accomplish the feat. Today the Braves beat the Mets, 5-2.

Ken Griffey Jr hits a game-tying homer in the 9th, then adds a go-ahead
homer in the 11th to pace the Reds to a 4-3 win over the host Florida
Marlins. Junior's first homer is off Braden Looper and his 2nd, a 2-out shot,
comes off Armando Almanza.

2006
At the Rogers Centre, Vernon Wells connects for three homers to pace the
Blue Jays to an 8-5 win over Boston. Gustavo Chacin (6-1) is the winner.

2007
Toronto's third baseman Howie Clark, believing he hears teammate John McDonald
calling to make the play, allows Jorge Posada's pop fly to land on the ground
untouched for an RBI single. The Blue Jays, convinced it was baserunner
Alex Rodriguez' voice which caused the infielder to back off the play,
become incensed describing the Yankee superstar's behavior as bush league.

2010
Max Scherzer becomes the first hurler since 1900 to strike out 14 batters
in less than six innings. The Tigers' right-hander reaches the total in
5 2/3 shutout frames enroute to a Detroit 10-2 victory over Oakland at
Comerica Park.

The Yankees' Mark Teixeira records his 250th career homerun in the 7th
inning against the Cleveland Indians. Teixeira becomes the 197th player to
reach this mark.

2013
Jacoby Ellsbury sets a single-game franchise record when he swipes five
bases in the Red Sox' 9-2 victory over Philadelphia. The 29-year-old center
fielder lead the American League in stolen bases in his first two seasons
in the majors, but injuries during the recent years have slowed down the
Boston speedy leadoff hitter.

2014
The Mets become the first team to have three players appear in a game whose
last name begins with a lower case 'd', when Travis d'arnaud, Jake deGrom,
and Matt den Dekker all play in the Mets' 6-5 walk-off loss to Philadelphia
at Citizens Bank Park. After having to use an upside-down capital 'P'
on d'arnaud's jersey last season due to lack of lower case letters, New
York equipment manager Kevin Kierst asked Majestic, MLB's uniform supplier,
to make 'small' uniform letters available, knowing there would be even
more of a need this season.
