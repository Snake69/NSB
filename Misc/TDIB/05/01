May 1

1901
White Sox Herm McFarland hits the first grand slam in American League
history in a game which features the Detroit Tigers committing 12 errors -
10 by the infield. There are, in fact, two grand slams hit in the game -
the other by Dummy Hoy in the White Sox' 19-9 win over Detroit. The two
grand slams in the same game sets an AL record. The 12 errors sets another
AL record which the White Stockings will tie May 6, 1903 against the Tigers.

1902
Mathewson pitches his 2nd shutout of the year against Philadelphia, this
time allowing just two Quaker hits while striking out 8. Matty also has 2
hits and cracks his first ML homer, off Cy Vorhees, to win 3-0.

Boston beats Baltimore, 6-4, and John McGraw is tossed in the 9th after
being hit on the butt with a pitch only to have umpire Sheridan say he
didn't try to avoid the pitch. Sheridan also upsets the crowd with a foul
call on a ball. After the game a fan heaves a brick at the ump but hits a
policeman instead.

An article in the Washington Post states the following:  "The new rule
adopted by the National League which prohibits a player from taking first
on being hit by a slow pitch is bound to add to the trouble of the umpires."

1905
Cold weather holds the crowd to 1,500 at South End Grounds as Mathewson
and the Giants freeze the Beaneaters, 8-2. For Matty it is his 100th
career victory.

1906
John Lush, 20, posts a 1-0 no-hitter over Brooklyn for the Phils, striking
out 11 and walking three. Mal Eason takers the loss. The Philadelphia
Inquirer states, "The trolley dodgers were triumphantly baffled by Lush's
drop curve." Ward, who had cleared waivers by all 15 teams, had 4 hits for
the Phils, and has 7 in his last 2 games.

The Boston Americans drop an 8-0 decision to the Highlanders, the first
of a franchise record 19 losses in a row. OF Jesse Burkett is released by
the Americans to manage the Worcester team, which he owns. Burkett will be
voted into the Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Vet's committee.

1908
In New York's 9-4 win over the Washington Senators, Kid Elberfeld is severely
spiked in the foot by Bob Ganley, essentially ending his season. He'll go
to bat just 56 times this year.

1911
Detroit rolls by Cleveland, 14-5, as Cobb again steals home against George
Kahler. This time, Grover Land is the catcher. Smith was behind the plate
on the 18th.

The Phillies long-time trainer of 17 years, Mike Scanlon, dies at age 70.

Grover Cleveland "Old Pete" Alexander is backed by two homers - by John Titus
and Sherry MaGee - as the Phillies top Boston's Buster Brown, 3-1. Boston
records 23 assists, including a NL record 8 in the 4th inning.

1912
Ty Cobb swipes home in the 1st inning and the Tigers go on to beat the
White Sox, 6-5.

George Sisler, a freshman pitching for the University of Michigan, strikes
out 20 in 7 innings.

1913
Pete Alexander earns his first win of the year, topping the Giants Jeff
Tesreau, 1-0. Alex scores the only Phils run after reaching base on an error.

Brooklyn's Casey Stengel hits two inside the park homers off Boston's
Otto Hess in a 4-2 win at home. On August 16th, teammate Bob Fisher will
duplicate the feat against the Cardinals, off Geyer and Trekell.

1915
In their second matchup of the season, Grover Cleveland Alexander again
tops Christy Mathewson, as the Phils win, 4-2, over the Giants.

At St. Louis, the Cardinals trip the Reds, 9-5. St. Louis 2B Miller Huggins
helps by pulling the hidden ball trick on Tommy Leach in the 7th inning. The
out call is made by home plate ump Charlie Rigler since the base ump had his
back to the play. An argument ensues between Rigler and Reds manager Buck
Herzog, who pushes the ump and spikes his foot. Rigler reacts by hitting
Herzog with his mask. Herzog will get a 5-day suspension for his actions.

1916
Lefty Babe Ruth loses his first game after 5 wins, as the Senators beat
Boston, 5-3. Ruth allows just 5 singles in 7 2/3 innings, but walks 9. The
Babe walks the bases loaded in the 8th, and reliever Dutch Leonard serves
up a 3-run double to Washington catcher John Henry.

The Phil's Pete Alexander beats Boston, 3-0, for his 2nd shutout of the year.

1918
In Boston, Walter Johnson tops the Red Sox and Carl Mays, 5-0. For the Big
Train, it is his first win of the year after three losses. Harry Hooper
has 3 of the Sox 4 hits.

1919
In Boston's home opener, the Yankees defeat Carl Mays to win, 7-3. The
Yanks score 4 in the 9th on 2 hits, 3 errors, a wild pitch and 2 walks.

1920
In Boston, Brooklyn's Leon Cadore and the Braves' Joe Oeschger duel 26 innings
to a 1-1 tie in the longest game ever played in the ML. Oeschger shuts
out the Dodgers for the last 21 innings, topping Art Nehf's 20 scoreless
frames in a row on August 1, 1918. He gives up 9 hits, and Cadore allows
12, in the 3-hour 50-minute battle, the longest marathon (26 innings) any
2 pitchers have hurled this century. Braves' Charlie Pick establishes the
major league record for hitless at-bats in one game as he goes 0 for 11 in
the marathon. An unusual double play occurs in the 17th inning when the bases
are loaded with one out. A grounder to P Oeschger results in a throw home,
forcing the runner. C Hank Gowdy's throw to 1B Walter Holke is fumbled,
and when the runner tries to score from 2B, the throw back to Gowdy nips
the sliding Ed Konetchy. Holke must have been tired as he made a first
baseman's record of 42 putouts in the game, while Cadore, who sets a NL
record (ties ML) for assists by a pitcher (12) as well as batters faced
(96) in a game, will spend the next 36 hours in bed. Oeschger faces 90
batters. The Dodgers lose to the Phils at home in 13 innings the next day,
then return to Boston for a Monday game where they lose again in 19. For
58 innings work in 3 days, they will be 0-2.

Babe Ruth hits his first HR, and the 50th of his career, as a Yankee in a
6-0 win over the Red Sox. The HR clears the RF roof of the Polo Grounds,
duplicating the feat of Joe Jackson. Duffy Lewis adds a homer, both coming
off Herb Pennock. During the game Yankee bench hecklers Carl Mays, Ernie
Shore and Frank O'Doul manage to get themselves ejected.

1922
Making his major league debut, Brooklyn rookie Harry "Pop" Shriver tosses
a 2-0 shutout over the Phillies. Shriver is the first Brooklyn hurler to
debut with a shutout, but he'll end his career at just 4-6. Brooklyn first
sacker Sam Post has an easy day making just one put out.

For the 4th game in a row, the Giants score 10+ runs as they down the host
Braves, 10-3. Winning P Jesse Barnes has two of the 14 hits.

1924
White Sox SS Bill Barrett steals home twice, in the first and in the 9th,
in a 13-7 win over Cleveland. He ties the ML mark.

1925
The A's introduce another future Hall of Famer, 17-year-old C Jimmie Foxx,
who pinch-hits and singles against Washington. But the A's lose, 9-4.

Detroit reliever Lil Stoner makes just one pitch, a wild one, to allow the
winning run to score as Cleveland wins, 8-7.

1926
Satchel Paige, 19 years old, makes his debut in the Negro Southern League,
pitching Chattanooga to a 5-4 win over Birmingham.

1927
One-year-wonder Hod Lisenbee, 28, blanks the Red Sox 6-0 for the Senators
in his first ML start. He will be 18-9 with 4 shutouts for the 3rd-place
Senators and never have another winning season.

The Pirates rally in the 9th inning to beat the Cubs, 7-6. Cubs' starter
Charley Root walks the bases loaded before Paul Waner singles in the winning
run. Chicago went ahead in the 7th inning when Chuck Tolson hits the first
pinch grand slam in Cubs' history.

The Yankees ride the tandem of Ruth and Gehrig to a 7-3 win over the
Athletics. Ruth bangs a first inning homer off Jack Quinn, and Gehrig hits
one off Quinn in the 6th. Babe comes back in the 8th with another homer,
off Rube Walberg, as New York takes over undisputed possession of first place.

1928
Indians' outfielders tie the ML record with 5 assists in a game against
the Browns and rookie Sam Langford has 4 of them, also equaling the ML
record (Cliff Blau points out that the Plain Dealer play-by-play account
of this game gives Langford only 3 assists). It's the 10th time (once in
extra innings) it has happened in the major leagues, and the last time
this century. The Tribe is outhit 12-10 by St. Louis but they win, 4-3,
as Johnny Hodapp scores all 4 runs.

1929
The first-place Athletics score 8 runs off Milt Gaston in the first 2
innings enroute to a 24-6 pasting of the Red Sox. Grove is the easy winner,
exiting after 5 innings. Foxx has a pair of homers and Simmons has 5 hits,
including a double and homer. The 24 runs matches a franchise record set
in the Cobb protest game in 1912, and the 29 hits sets a franchise mark.

Helped by a triple play, the White Sox double the Indians, 8-4. Willie Kamm
finishes the triple play by nabbing Jamieson with a hidden ball trick at 3B.

1930
At Fenway, a high fever strikes out Indians SS Joe Sewell, ending his
consecutive game streak at 1,103. He has not missed a game since 1922. The
Indians still prevail, 8-5.

At Pittsburgh, rookie Wally Berger blasts homers in the 7th and 8th innings
to lead the Braves to a 4-3 win over Larry French. After Berger's 1st homer,
Johnny Neun, in his 5th season, adds his first ML homer.

1932
Bill Hallahan walks 10 Cubs, but allows just 3 singles as the Cards top
the Cubs, 7-1. Bush is the loser.

The New York Yankees re-acquire relief ace Wilcy Moore from the Red Sox.

1933
Earl Grace and Arky Vaughan slug grand slams for the Pirates and Bill Swift
coasts to a 10-0 win over the Phillies.

1934
Burleigh Grimes picks up a win as he relieves in the Cardinals' 3-2 win
over the Reds in eleven innings. The Birds will waive Grimes (2-1) to the
Pirates in two weeks.

At Washington, the Yankees give Danny MacFayden a 3-run lead in the first,
but he can't hold it and he leaves in the 7th with the score tied at 3
apiece. New York scores 5 runs in the 9th to win it for Uhle, 10-5. MacFayden
was making his first start against Washington since June 2, 1932, when he
lost his ML-record-tying 14th straight game to the Nats.

1937
Joe DiMaggio makes his debut as a starter after missing six games, and
strokes three hits against Rube Walberg. New York tips the Red Sox, 3-2.

1938
Why play the second game? In the PCL San Diego sweeps a doubleheader against
San Francisco winning both games by a 16-1 score.

1939
At Comiskey Park, the White Sox defeat the Cubs and Dizzy Dean, 4-1, in
an exhibition game to benefit Monty Stratton. The former pitcher, who lost
his leg in an off-season hunting accident, tries to pitch in the game and
receives a new car and nearly $30,000 as a result of the contest.

1940
The Reds' Bill Werber has just 2 hits, but his homer and double come in an
8-run 4th inning. The Reds beat Hugh Casey and Brooklyn, 9-2.

1941
Reds P Bucky Walters stops the Dodgers, 2-1, in 11 innings. The Dodgers
load the bases in the 11th, but Durocher and Babe Phelps strike out to end
the game. Curt Davis takes the loss.

Cecil Travis raises his average to .571 with a homer and 2 doubles to pace the
Senators to a 7-0 win over the White Sox. Dutch Leonard twirls the shutout.

1942
Before 3,620 at Wrigley Field, the Cubs outslug the Giants to win, 13-9. The
Giants have two homers, both by pitchers, as Hugh East and Harry Feldman hit
their first major league homers, both off Cubs starter Jake Mooty. Peanuts
Lowry homers for the Cubs.

1944
George Myatt of the Washington Senators collects 6 hits (5 singles and a 2B)
in 6 at-bats, as the Nats pound out 20 hits to beat Boston, 11-4.

1945
Skeeter Webb's bouncing single over 2B in the 3rd deprives Chicago's Joe
Haynes of a perfect game. No other Tiger runner reaches base as the White
Sox win, 5-0, on Haynes one-hitter.

1946
Boo Ferris benefits from 13 runs and the Red Sox tame the Tigers, 13-1.

About to be benched for poor hitting, Dick Whitman collects 5 hits to pace
the Dodgers to a 5-1 win over the Cubs. The Cubs strand 13.

1947
For the first time Cleveland will play all its games at Municipal Stadium,
abandoning League Park, where most weekday games have been played. New
owner Bill Veeck installs an inner fence to cut power alleys from 435 to
365 feet. A more celebrated attempt to fuel HRs is at Pittsburgh where the
30-foot reduction of the LF wall is dubbed Greenberg Gardens, for the Pirates'
famous acquisition. Hank will hit only 25 HRs for the season, however,
but sophomore Ralph Kiner will find the shortened distance more advantageous.

1949
Elmer Valo is the first AL player to hit 2 bases-loaded triples in a game when
he leads the A's to a 15-9 win in the first of two against the Senators. Valo
will have a 3rd bases-loaded triple during the season, to tie the AL mark
of Shano Collins in 1918. The A's take game 2, 7-3, called after 7 innings.

1950
The Red Sox bring up slugger Walt Dropo from their Louisville farm club to
replace the injured Billy Goodman at 1B.

1951
In an 8-3 loss to the Yankees at Comiskey Park, White Sox hurler Randy
Gumpert gives up the first of Mickey Mantle's 536 major league home runs. The
Mother's Day blast, which will be worth $165,000 at Sotheby's auction in
2004, is inscribed by the future Hall of Famer's own hand which includes
the following detail on the ball, "My first H.R. in the Majors, May 1,
1951, 4:50 p.m. Chicago" as well as "6th inning off Randy Gumpert."

Becoming the first black to play for the White Sox, Minnie Minoso makes his
debut hitting a homerun against the Yankees' Vic Raschi in his first plate
appearance for the club. The speedy outfielder, who had previously played
with the Cleveland Indians, bats .326 (173 hits) and leads the league in
stolen bases and triples, but loses out to Yankee infielder Gil McDougald
for Rookie of the Year Award honors.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants collect 5 hits - 3 by Alvin Dark - to beat
the Cubs, 5-3. Dark's big hit is a grand slam in the 6th. He also starts a
nifty DP in the 7th when, with 2 on and no out, Terwilliger lines a ball
of Jim Hearn's ankle and the carom is fielded by Dark. With Chicago in
the field in the 4th, Umpire Frank Dascoli banished the entire bench of
Cubs players (11 of them) to the clubhouse, apparently for calling him
"Rabbit Ears." Later, two of the players, Bill Serena and Smoky Burgess,
were recalled for pinch hitting duties.

The A's (2-12) score a record 8 runs in the 11th inning to beat Detroit,
9-1, and end their 10-game losing streak. Dave Philley, in his 1st day as
an Athletic, hits a bunt single and triple in the big frame. Lou Limmer's
bases loaded triple off Gene Bearden starts the scoring.

University of New Mexico pitchers walk 21 Arizona batters in a college
baseball game.

1952
With one out in the 8th inning, the A's Skeeter Kell beats out an infield
hit to break up Joe Dobson's no hitter. The A's Dave Philley adds a solid
single in the 9th as Dobson and the White Sox win, 3-0.

1953
The Pirates defeat the Reds, 8-3, for their 3rd win in a row, their longest
win streak since August 24-26, 1951. Bonus baby Paul Pettit is the winner
in his first ML start, with relief help. It'll prove to be his only ML
win. Pete Castiglione has 2 HRs and a single.

The U.S. Court of Appeals denies the $450,000 suit of former pitcher Boyd
Tepler made in 1951 against organized baseball, the Cubs, and William Wrigley
for an arm injury suffered in 1944. He had contended that negligent coaching,
in effect, ended his career prematurely.

1954
Red Sox IF Billy Goodman's single in the 6th spoils Virgil Trucks' bid for
another no-hitter. Trucks, now with the White Sox, wins 3-0.

1955
Indian starters put on a 'pitching clinic' during a doubleheader sweep of
the Red Sox. Veteran Bob Feller holds Boston hitless for 6+ innings and
hurls his major league record 12th one-hitter (the no-hitter was spoiled
by Sammy White's single in the 7th) in a 2-0 victory and in the night cap,
rookie left-hander Herb Score strikes out the first nine batters and 12
through the first 5 frames (he will whiff a total of 16 missing Bob Feller's
strikeout record by 2) enroute to a 2-1 four-hit win.

In the Giants 2-1 win over the Reds, the 2 teams toil 16 innings combining
for a record-tying 10 double plays. The only other time 10 were turned
was 30 years ago, when the Reds and Braves made 10 DPs in 12 innings. An
alert Don Mueller starts the rally in the 16th when the Reds are trying to
intentionally walk him. He hits an outside 4th-ball pitch for a pop single,
sending Lockman to 3B. Johnny Antonelli pitches all 16 innings for the win.

Felipe Montemayor must've had the right breakfast today as the Pirate hits a
2-run HR in each game of a DH with the Cards. They are the only two homers
of his career. The Cards take the opener, 4-3, and the Bucs are victorious
in the nightcap, 7-0, behind Ron Kline.

1956
Mantle takes Steve Gromek deep in the first inning at the Stadium, and
New York rolls to a 9-2 win over Detroit. Bauer also homers as Whitey Ford
hurls his 3rd CG win.

1957
Wally Post laces a 2-run single in the 16th to give the Reds an 8-6 win
over the host Phillies.

The Cubs send 1B Dee Fondy and 2B Gene Baker to Pittsburgh for 1B Dale Long
and OF Lee Walls. Fondy hits .300 but will be traded, while Walls and Long
will knock out 45 HRs for the Cubs this season.

1959
At Chicago's Comiskey Park, White Sox pitcher Early Wynn, 39, tosses a
one-hitter for a 1-0 victory over Boston. He fans 14 and belts a homer in
the inning for the only run off Tom Brewer. Outfielder Bill Renna gets his
glove on Wynn's fly ball but it deflects into the stands. Wynn last hit
was a homer at Comiskey Park on June 3, 1944.

Harmon Killebrew's 10th inning HR, the 2nd of the game for the third sacker,
gives Washington a 4-3 win over the woeful Tigers (2-14). Jim Bunning and
Camilo Pascual each go the rout. Bunning is done in by errors by Yost and
Bridges in the 8th, though Yost hits a double and HR against his old team.

The ML executive council approves the Players Association proposal for 2
All-Star Games each year.

1960
The Pirates, behind Vern Law's pitching, win their 9th game in a row, 13-2,
against the Reds at Cincinnati.

matches Mantle to up his RBI total to an AL high 32.

1962
At LA, Camilli singles in a run in the bottom of the 16th to give the
Dodgers a 6-5 win over the Cubs. Both teams score 2 in the 15th with Jim
Gilliam making the 3rd out on an attempted steal of home.

At Washington, the Senators snap a 13-game losing streak by edging the Red
Sox, 2-1. Pete Burnside twirls a 4-hitter.

The Yankees use three pitchers - Bill Stafford, Roland Sheldon and Marshall
Bridges - to beat the White Sox, 6-1, on a combined two hitter. Chicago's
first hit doesn't come until the 9th inning when Nellie Fox gets a lead
off base hit.

1964
The visiting Cubs make it look easy, scoring 10 runs in the first inning to
shoot down the Colt 45s 11-3. Billy Williams has a grand slam and a single
for 5 RBIs (a club record) in the big inning, and adds a run-scoring double
in the 8th to lead Chicago.

1965
Trying to break up a double play, Dodger outfielder Tommy Davis dislocates
and breaks his ankle sliding into second base in a 4-2 win over the visiting
Giants. The two-time National League batting champion will not reappear
until October 3rd.

In the nightcap of a day-night doubleheader, Dave Giusti and the Astros beat
the Cubs, 4-0, to extend the team's winning streak to double digits. The
ten consecutive victories will remain a club record until 1999.

In a 9-8 loss at Detroit, Boston's Chuck Schilling ties a ML record with
his 2nd straight pinch-hit HR in back-to-back games. But Boston loses both.

1966
In his 2nd start, Sam McDowell has to settle for a one-hitter. Don Buford's
3rd-inning double is Chicago's only hit in Cleveland's 1-0 win. McDowell
becomes the first pitcher since Whitey Ford (September 1955) to pitch
back-to-back one-hitters.

In the 1st of two games today, the Angels and Red Sox combine for 9 DPs,
setting an AL record, and tying the ML. Boston and the Twins will match it for
a regulation game in 1990. California wins, 6-1, then loses the nitecap, 9-1.

The Orioles set a club record with their 10th straight win, beating Detroit,
4-1.

1967
Dennis Bennett gives the Red Sox a 4-0 win over California and Jorge
Rubio. Bennett homers in his own cause and George Scott homers as well.

1968
Sudden Sam McDowell of Cleveland strikes out 16 batters and defeats Oakland,
3-1.

1969
Houston, no-hit the day before by Cincinnati's Jim Maloney, answers back, as
Don Wilson pitches a 4-0 no-hitter, with 13 strikeouts over the Reds. Houston
ties a NL record with just one assist. In Wilson's previous start against
Cincinnati, on April 22, he gave up 6 runs in 5 innings in a 14-0 loss.

1970
At Cincinnati, the Reds lead the Pirates, 6-4, with 2 outs in the 9th when
Willie Stargell comes to the plate. Sparky Anderson then moves pitcher
Wayne Granger to LF, not wanting to remove him if Stargell reaches base,
and brings in Don Gullett to face the Bucs' slugger. Stargell, who accounted
for all the Bucs' runs with a grand slam, strikes out, and the Reds win, 6-4.

1971
Against the Red Sox, Minnesota starter Jim Perry serves up homerun balls
to the first two batters, Luis Aparicio and Reggie Smith. This hasn't
happened in the AL since 1962 when Perry was on the mound for Cleveland
against the Twins. Perry shakes off his start to win, 7-3, collecting 3
hits and scoring 3 runs himself.

1972
At Dodger Stadium, Dick Selma goes the distance beating Los Angeles,
2-1. The right-hander's 3-hitter is the fifth consecutive complete game
thrown by a Phillies' starter.

Jim Wynn hits a grand slam and Edward hits a 3-run homer to help the Astros
edge the Pirates, 9-8. Both homers come off Steve Blass. Jim "Sting" Ray,
who pitches the last 2 innings, wins his 4th straight.

1973
With 2 outs in the 9th inning and Chris Speier on 1B, the Giants, trailing
8-1, score an NL-record tying 7 times to beat the Pirates 8-7. Chris Arnold's
pinch grand slam is the big blow, along with Bobby Bonds' bases-loaded double.

Brewers starter Bill Parsons walks the first three A's batters and is lifted
for Jim Colborn, who pitches a complete game, 4-3, win. Johnny Briggs drives
in all the Milwaukee runs, including a homerun in the 9th inning off Blue
Moon Odom (0-5), to win it.

1974
Using just five pitches, Pirates starter Doc Ellis, upset with his opponent's
swagger, hits the first three Reds' batters he faces. After plunking
Pete Rose, Joe Morgan and Dan Driessen, the pitcher deliberately throws
two pitches behind Tony Perez' head before walking the clean-up hitter,
and then goes 0-2 on the next batter, Johnny Bench, before he is removed
by Pittsburgh pilot Danny Murtaugh. Dock later reveals that he was high on
pep pills at the time. The Bucs lose 5-3 to the Reds.

Tom Seaver allows only 3 hits and 2 walks, striking out 16 Dodgers in 12
innings, but the Mets lose in the 14th 2-1.

1975
Hank Aaron goes 4 for 4, driving in 2 runs in the Brewers 17-3 win over
Detroit. This brings his career RBI total to 2,211, breaking Babe Ruth's
published record of 2,209. His third inning single off Vern Ruhle drives in
Lezcano with his 2,210th RBI. On February 3, 1976, the Records Committee
will revise Ruth's total to 2,204; so, in actuality, Aaron set the record
on April 18, 1975.

1979
In the bottom of the 11th inning, pinch-hitter Roger Freed blasts a two-out
walk-off grand slam off Joe Sambito giving the Cardinals an amazing 7-6
comeback victory over Houston. In the top of the frame, the Astros had
scored three runs to take a 6-3 lead before the 34-year-old reserve player
ended the game in dramatic fashion.

Phil Niekro earns his 200th career win as the Braves beat the Pirates
5-2. Gary Mathews hits 2 homers including an IPHR to break a 2-2 tie in
the 9th. The event is saddened by the collapse of Atlanta's popular GM,
Bill Lucas, who will pass away tomorrow.

1980
Pittsburgh's Bill "Mad Dog" Madlock is fined $5,000 and suspended 15 games by
NL president Chub Feeney for poking umpire Jerry Crawford in the face with
his glove after being called out on strikes with the bases loaded. Madlock
appeals and remains in uniform, but finally withdraws the appeal and begins
serving the suspension on June 6th, after disgruntled NL umpires threaten
to eject him from every game he tries to play in.

Pete Falcone ties the modern ML record by striking out the first 6 batters
of the game, but his Mets lose to the Phillies, 2-1. Falcone finishes with
8 strikeouts in 7 innings.

1981
Frank White's 4th-inning sacrifice fly off Steve Comer ends the Rangers'
consecutive-scoreless-inning streak at 39, and Kansas City goes on to a
4-0 win. Texas pitchers had tossed 4 consecutive shutouts, one shy of the
AL record.

1984
Dwight Gooden becomes the first teenager to strike out at least ten players
since Bert Blyleven accomplished the feat in 1970. The Mets 19-year-old
phenom, who will set a rookie record with 276 Ks, will have a total of 15
double-digit strikeout games this year.

1985
Toronto's Jimmy Key beats the Royals 6-3 to become the first lefthanded
starter to win for the Blue Jays since Paul Mirabella on October 4, 1980,
a span of 614 games.

1986
Zane Smith strikes out 12 batters as the Braves beat the Mets, 7-2, ending
New York's club-record-tying 11-game winning streak.

winner was Bob Welch with a CG win; today the W goes to Rick Honeycutt.

1987
Free-agents Ron Guidry (Yankees), Rich Gedman (Red Sox), Bob Boone (Angels)
and Tim Raines (Expos) all re-sign with their former clubs on the first
day that they are allowed to do so. Doyle Alexander will re-sign with the
Braves on May 5th.

1989
In San Francisco, Cubs catcher Damon Berryhill hits a leadoff homer in
the 12th, off LaCoss, and Chicago wins, 4-3 over the Giants. Jeff Pico is
the winner.

1990
The Braves Derek Lilliquist homers twice in a 5-2 win over the Mets,
becoming the first pitcher to do so since Jim Gott in 1985.

1991
44-year-old Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan hurls the record 7th no-hitter of his
amazing career, defeating the Toronto Blue Jays on Arlington Appreciation
Night by a score of 3-0. Ryan strikes out 16 batters in the process,
marking the 209th time he has fanned 10 or more in a game, and the 26th
time putting 15 or more down on strikes.

The Brewers defeat the White Sox in a 6-hour 5-minute, 19-inning contest,
the longest in the AL since the same two clubs played 25 innings on May 8,
1984. Oddly enough, Willie Randolph, who drove home the winning run in the
19th, had been the last out in Nolan Ryan's 6th no-hitter.

Oakland's Rickey Henderson garners his 939th career stolen base in the
4th inning of a game against the Yankees to break Lou Brock's all-time
mark. With Brock standing next to him, Henderson modestly proclaims, "Lou
Brock was certainly a great basestealer, but today I'm the greatest of all
time." In another curious tie-in with Nolan Ryan, Henderson had been the
victim of Ryan's 5,000th career strikeout.

Dodger OF Darryl Strawberry ties an NL record by striking out 5 times in a
game against the Expos. "I really can't figure it out," he says, "because
I feel so good up there." Strawberry also drops a fly ball for a 3-base
error in the 9-3 loss.

1992
Oakland OF Rickey Henderson steals the 1,000th base of his career in the
1st inning of the A's 7-6 win over Detroit. Mark McGwire adds a homer and
Mike Parrett (4-0) picks up the win when the A's score a run in the 8th.

Seattle's Randy Johnson hands out 10 walks in just 4 1/3 innings in a 15-1
swamping by the Orioles. The Big Unit allows 8 earned runs. Mike Devereaux
has a pair of homers, one a grand slam, and drives in 6 runs. 6' 7" McDonald
(3-0) pitches the complete-game win.

1995
The owners and umpires reach agreement on a 5-year contract, ending the
lockout. Regular umpires will return to work on May 3.

1996
The Yanks and Orioles continue their marathon play, this one going 5
hours and 43 minutes before ending at 1 a.m. Tino Martinez, whose homer
snapped yesterday's tie, slugs a grand slam in the 15th to give reliever
Andy Pettitte the win. Bernie Williams has 5 hits while Gerald Williams
collects 6 - just the 2nd Yankee to get 6 in a game; Myril Hoag in 1934,
is the other. The O's and Yankees strand 15 runners in extra innings, as
both teams squander scoring opportunities, and New York survives 4 errors
by two second basemen. Jim Mecir strikes out Brady Anderson with the bases
loaded in the 10th after going to a 3-0 count. Cal Ripken is lifted for
a pinch runner in the 8th - who is promptly picked off - and sits for the
last 7 innings, the longest stretch he's rested in 2,180 games.

Roger Clemens strikes out 13 Tigers, including Cecil Fielder three times,
for his first win of the year. The 5-1 victory for the Sox sends Detroit
to its 12th loss in 13 games.

The Mets and Expos swap shutouts, with Pedro Martinez topping New York in the
opener, 4-0, and Jason Isringhausen allowing 4 hits in winning the nightcap,
6-0. Martinez, 8-0 against the Mets, allows just 2 singles, both in the 7th
inning. Henry Rodriguez, who hits a 3-run homer after apparently peeking
at Mets C Todd Hundley glove, says, "I've got 10 homers, I don't need to
look back."

1997
Randy Meyers gets the last two outs of the ninth inning in the Orioles'
3-2 win over Twins in the Metrodome. The Baltimore closer has recorded 11
consecutive saves to start the season.

1999
Detroit hurler Brian Moehler is ejected in the 7th inning for having a piece
of sandpaper on his thumb. Two batters later, Randy Winn's sacrifice fly
gives Tampa Bay the 4-3 win for Bobby Witt. Moehler will receive a 10-game
suspension for his actions. Roberto Hernandez gets the save for the Devil
Rays. It is the 200th of his career, making him the 1st Latin pitcher to
reach the mark.

The Cardinals defeat the Expos, 16-5, as rookie Outfielder J.D. Drew scores
5 runs for St. Louis, and 3B Fernando Tatis hits his 8th HR and drives home 3.

The Brewers signed P Hideo Nomo. Nomo will make 1 start for the Brewers
Double-A team, which will be on Sunday, and then he'll join the team.

Tom Schieffer resigned as the President of the Rangers in order to spend
more time developing real estate around the Ballpark in Arlington. Schieffer
also says he may help Texas Gov. George W. Bush run for the White House.

2000
San Francisco's left fielder Barry Bonds becomes the first player to hit
a ball into San Francisco Bay aka McCovey's Cove. The first 'splashdown'
homerun at Pacific Bell Park helps the Giants to beat the Mets, 10-3. It
is Bonds' 11th HR of the year.

The Braves establish a franchise-record 14th straight victory with a 2-1
victory at Dodger Stadium. Quilvio Veras' third-inning homer proves to be
the difference.

The Rockies defeat the Expos, 15-8, as OF Todd Helton slams 3 HRs for
Colorado. The two teams combine for a Coors Field record 10 homers in
the game.

2001
As a result of being struck by the flying barrel of a broken bat, Mike
Fyhrie breaks the ulna bone in his left arm. The Cubs' righty reliever
used his arm to protect himself as the Padres' Santiago Perez broken bat
exploded in the direction of the mound.

The Giants beat the Pirates, 11-6, as Jeff Kent drives home 7 runs. His
3-run HR in the 1st chases Ramon Martinez, and he adds a 3-run double in
the 4th. Emil Brown homers for the Bucs.

Mike Mussina 3-hits the Twins to win, 4-0, for the Yankees. Justice has
a solo HR in the 6th off Eric Milton, the losing pitcher, and Posada adds
ribbie singles in the 7th and 9th.

2002
The Padres defeat the Cubs, 4-3, with Trevor Hoffman saving the game for
Bobby Jones. It is Hoffman's 321st save for SD, a ML record for most with
one team. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley held the old mark. The long-time Padre
closer, now eighth on the all-time list, was traded as a rookie pitcher by
the Marlins as part of the Gary Sheffield deal in 1993.

2003
Baseball players agree to a two-year experiment to give home-field advantage
in the WS to the league that wins the All-Star Game. The two sides also
agree to increase the roster size from 30 to 32, and to give players,
managers and coaches a say on who makes the team.

The Orioles sweep a doubleheader from the Tigers, winning by scores of
5-2 and 6-4, to drop Detroit's record to 3-23. In the 1st game, BJ Ryan
earns the win in relief without throwing a single pitch. After relieving
Pat Hentgen with two outs in the 7th, he picks Omar Infante off first base
to end the inning. The Orioles go on to score 3 runs in the bottom half
of the inning to make him the pitcher of record on the winning side. He is
relieved by Buddy Groom for the 8th and Jorge Julio in the 9th. In the 2nd
game, Detroit P Mike Maroth hurls 7 innings of hitless ball before giving
up a leadoff single to Jay Gibbons in the 8th. Maroth eventually takes the
loss, dropping his record to 0-7. He misses by one day from becoming the
1st pitcher in history to lose 7 games in April.

2004
In the 6-3 victory over the Marlins at Pac Bell Park, Barry Bonds sets a
major league record by being walked four times intentionally in a nine-inning
game. In 1990, Cubs' outfielder Andre Dawson was given five intentional passes
in a 16-inning contest against the Reds. IBB became an official stat in 1955.

At Milwaukee's Miller Park, Chad Moeller becomes the first Brewer to hit
for the cycle at home. In the 9-8 victory over the Reds, against starter
Cory Lidle, the back up catcher homers in the second inning, doubles in the
fourth, triples in the fifth and then singles in the seventh off reliever
Ryan Wagner to complete the feat in front of 8,918 enthusiastic fans.

Frank Catalanotto becomes the first player in franchise history to collect six
hits in one game. The Blue Jays left fielder's five singles and a double help
Toronto to beat the White Sox, 10-6. As a team Toronto pounds out 18 hits.

The Yankees rout the Royals, 12-4, as Ruben Sierra hits 2 HRs and drives
in 7 runs.

2005
The Brewers defeat the Reds, 13-3. Lyle Overbay leads the 19-hit Milwaukee
attack with 5 safeties, including a double and HR.

Molina accounting for their only 2 hits. The loss goes to Johan Santana,
ending Santana's 17-game winning streak (over 2 seasons).

2006
The Braves defeat the Rockies, 2-0, on Tim Hudson's one-hitter. Opposing
P Jason Jennings' 3rd inning single is Colorado's only safety.

The Padres trade C Doug Mirabelli back to the Red Sox for C Josh Bard,
minor league P Cla Meredith, a 23-year-old reliever, and cash. Bard was
leading the AL in passed balls and the Sox hurriedly put Mirabelli in the
lineup to catch Tim Wakefield. Mirabelli has a police escort to Fenway and
changes uniforms in the cab. He arrives at Fenway Park 13 minutes before
game-time. With Mirabelli catching, Wakefield goes 7 innings and leaves
with the game tied 3 apiece against the Yankees. David Ortiz clubs a 3-run
HR in the 8th and the Sox win, 7-3.

2009
Joe Mauer makes his delayed season debut memorable by hitting a homerun
in his first at-bat during the Twins 7-5 victory over the Royals at the
Metrodome. The two-time batting champion, who missed spring training and
the first 22 games while recovering from inflammation in his lower back,
gets his fourth standing ovation of the night as the 2-0 first-inning
fastball thrown by Sidney Ponson sails into the left-field stands.

2011
The Phillies fans attending the ESPN Sunday Night Game against the Mets start
chanting "USA, USA" when word spreads of the death of Osama bin Laden. The
reaction of the sellout crowd comes as a surprise to the players on the
field who are unaware of the historic event.

2012
With the final payment received on the record $2.15-billion purchase
price, Frank McCourt's turbulent era of the Dodger ownership comes to an
end. The team's new ownership group, fronted by Magic Johnson and incoming
club president Stan Kasten, includes Mark Walter, chief executive of the
Chicago-based Guggenheim Financial, who arranged the financing and holds
a controlling interest in the franchise.

Twenty years after getting his first win managing New York at the old Yankee
Stadium, Buck Showalter records his 1,000th career managerial victory when
Baltimore beats his former team at the new Bronx ballpark. The 55-year-old
detail-driven skipper has compiled a 1,000-958 record during his stints
with the Yankees, Diamondbacks, Rangers and Orioles.
