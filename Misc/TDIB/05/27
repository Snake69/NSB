May 27

1901
3B Jimmy Burke of Milwaukee makes 4 errors in the 4th inning, a ML record
tied by Cleveland's Ray Chapman in 1914 and the Cubs' Len Merullo in 1942. The
A's score 7 times in the frame and Eddie Plank coasts home with an 8-3 win.

1904
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants' 32-year-old Kentucky native, Dan McGann,
steals 5 bases in a 3-1 victory over Brooklyn, a feat not duplicated in
the NL until August 24, 1974, by Davey Lopes. Otis Nixon will steal 6 for
the record. Mathewson (5-5) is victorious over Ned Garvin. The win gives
the Giants (21-10) a tie with Chicago for first place, with the Reds in
3rd place by .001.

1905
Pulliam levies a $150 fine and a 15-day suspension. McGraw files for an
injunction against the fine and suspension, which the judge eventually
grants. On June 1st the NL board meets in Boston and clears McGraw of the
Dreyfuss charges, then censures Dreyfuss for engaging in a public altercation
with McGraw. The "Hey, Barney" line will follow Dreyfuss for years.

At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson stops Brooklyn, 4-1, beating Oscar
Jones. Except for a poor throw by Roger Bresnahan, Matty would've had his
3rd shutout.

1906
Five fans are killed and 25 injured by a bolt of lightning that strikes a
crowd watching a game near Mobile, Alabama.

1909
In a game featuring a AL record-setting 44 assists by both teams (as noted
by historian Joe Dittmar), the Naps nip the Browns, 5-2. The NL high assist
marks of April 23, 1903 and May 15, 1909 (NY vs. Cin) fall short of today's
record. Addie Joss for Cleveland and Barney Pelty for St. Louis are the
pitchers as each team records 22 assists.

1910
New York's Bugs Raymond strikes out 8 and stops Brooklyn, 8-2.

1911
Pitching his 2nd game in a row, Mathewson hurls the 1st-place Giants to a
2-0 win against the Phillies. Thousands are turned away at Hilltop Park.

Art Fromme allows just one hit - a double by Wagner in the 2nd - in pitching
the Reds to a 1-0 win over Pittsburgh.

At Chicago, Cleveland and Chicago battle to a 5-5 tie after 9 innings,
before Ed Walsh takes over in the 10th. The Naps rattle him for two doubles
and a run, and ace rookie Vean Gregg, who takes over in the 8th, holds on
for a 6-5 win. Frank Lange strikes out 10 Naps in 9 innings, but gives up
9 hits and five walks. Joe Birmingham has three hits to pace Cleveland.

After giving up 3 runs in 6 innings, the roof caves in on the Browns'
Bill Bailey, as the Tigers send him home a 9-3 loser. In the 5th inning,
Browns catcher Jim Stephens, attempting to catch Bush's pop foul, crashes
into the grandstand, knocking himself senseless, and sustaining a sprained
ankle. Melly Meleon has his 2nd homer in a week for St. Louis, off winning
pitcher Doc Lafitte.

At Washington, the Nationals knock Ray Collins out of the box and beat Boston,
9-4, behind Long Tom Hughes. Tris Speaker, batting for Ed Cicotte in the 9th,
has the longest hit of the day, a triple.

In New York, a team from the University of Keio tops Fordham, 11-6 in 8
innings. "The American collegians outplayed by Little Men From Orient at
Bronx Oval" banners the New York Times, which then relates that most of
the American crowd of 5,000 cheered for the visitors.

1912
In the 5th inning of a Giants' 6-2 win over Brooklyn, New York pitcher Red
Ames swipes home on the front end of a double steal.

1913
Using their bats, the Braves sweep two from the Giants, winning 1-0 and
5-2. In the opener, the lone run scores when Joe Connolly rounds 3B after
a single by Bill Sweeney. Giant CF George Burns makes a perfect throw but
the ball hits Sweeney's bat on the field and caroms off. George Tyler picks
up the win against Mathewson.

1914
The Cubs lose to Christy Mathewson and the Giants, 3-1, with George Zabel
taking the loss.

1915

inning. Matty stays to the 7th and the Giants tie the game at 5 runs
apiece. The Cards push across the winning run in the 10th off Ralph Stroud.

1916

4-2. Ruth has two hits for Boston.

In Boston's 6-4 loss to Cleveland, Babe Ruth slams a long triple, the first
ball hit off the CF screen in Cleveland. Speaker has a pair of doubles for
the Tribe.

1920
At Fenway Park, New York's Bob Shawkey walks in a run in the 4th inning and
yells at umpire George Hildebrand. When play resumes, Shawkey takes 5 minutes
to tie his shoe on the mound. Then after a called 3rd strike on Harry Hooper,
he doffs his cap and bows low to the ump. As Shawkey walks past Hildebrand,
the ump informs him he's out of the game: Shawkey's response is to swing at
the ump and Hildebrand then bangs him with his mask. Mays replaces Shawkey
and gives up no runs to insure the Yankees' 6-1 win. Shawkey draws a one
week suspension and a $200 fine for his theatrics. Additional theatrics are
provided by Babe Ruth who clubs homers off Harry Harper and Benn Karr. Ruth
has now belted four homers in three days, the first 20th century slugger
to do so (Ed Williamson is the other slugger, in 1884). He'll hit his 11th,
in tomorrow's double win over the Hubmen.

At the Polo Grounds, the Braves defeat the Giants twice, 5-2 and 5-0. Rudolph
and Scott are the winning pitchers, while Winters, with 3 2/3 innings
in game 1, and Barnes are the losers. Winters hits Les Mann twice with
pitches and when Barnes plunks him on the elbow in game 2, Mann is forced
to leave. The two teams combine for 45 (Braves 26) runners left on base,
considered a record at the time.

The train car carrying the Phillies uniforms and equipment is left in
Albany, and the Quakers borrow the road uniforms, bats and shoes of the
host Dodgers and win, 5-4, in 11 innings. George Smith goes all the way to
pick up the victory.

Composer Louis Hirsch sues the Yankees for $100,000 because of an incident
at the Yankee game at the Polo Grounds on the 24th. To avoid sitting next to
a cigar smoker, Hirsch switched seats with his brother. An usher informed
him it was against the rules to shift seats, and ordered the two brothers
to switch back. Hirsch refused and was forcibly ejected from the stands.

1921
Playing for the Wichita Wolves (Class A Western League) Jim Blakesley
connects for 5 doubles against Omaha to set an Organized Ball record. It
will be tied several times, the next occurrence in 1923.

The Phillies end their 12-game losing streak by beating Brooklyn 3-2. The
loss ends Brooklyn's 8-game winning skein.

1923
At New York, Phillies slugger Cy Williams cracks his 15th HR of May, a new
record for the month, and his 18th of the season. The homer comes off Giant
P Rosy Ryan in a losing cause, as the Giants win, 12-4. The 15 homers in
May will not be topped by any Phillie this century.

1925
In Philadelphia, the Senators nip the A's 10-9, as Johnson wins his 7th in
row. Al Simmons clocks one in the 4th inning with no one on that lands on
20th street. In five of Johnson's wins, Washington has scored 9 or more runs.

The Browns have 26 assists in a 10-inning 4-2 loss to the Indians. They
have 24 in the first 9 innings for an AL mark.

1927
In St. Louis, the Indians beat the Browns, 7-3, scoring their only earned
run on John Hoddap's homer. For the 2nd game in a row, veteran 1B George
Burns swipes home on the front end of a double steal with Joe Sewell,
pulling it off in the 9th. The two did it yesterday in game two's 9-7 win.

The Yankees split with the Senators, losing 7-2 before winning, 5-0. Herb
Pennock goes just 4 innings in game 1 and watches as Tris Speaker and Joe
Judge pull off a delayed double steal. Speaker swipes home. Gehrig hits his
11th homer in game 2 to back Waite Hoyt, who allows 3 hits in the 5-0 victory.

The Giants lose their 5th and 6th in a row as the Robins prevail, 5-3 and
5-1. Dazzy Vance allows 10 hits in the opener, including a single, homer
and triple by Hornsby, but he strikes out 10. Doc Farrell, leading the NL
with a .407 average, makes 4 errors at 3B and is benched for Lindstrom in
game 2. The Giants will trade Doc in 2 weeks. Jigger Statz hits his only
homer of the year ... inside-the-park ... in game 2 and is matched by Bill
Terry's solo HR. The "silver-haired" Jess Petty is the victor.

The Pirates win their 9th in a row, overcoming a 6-run deficit and beating
the Cardinals, 8-7. Reliever Joe Bush drives in the winning run with a 10th
inning single.

At Newark the Bears beat the Reading Keys, 13-4 and 9-8. Al Mamaux is the
game one winner, helped by 5 hits by Jock Conlon. It is the 26th and 27th
consecutive losses for Reading.

1928
In St. Louis, Reds ace Red Lucas suffers a broken wrist when he is hit by
a ball during pre-game batting practice. Lucas (8-2) beat the Cards 2 days
ago, 2-0, the same score that Mays will win by today. Lucas will return in
a few weeks and go 5-7 the rest of the year.

Aging star George Sisler clears AL waivers and joins another former St. Louis
hero, Rogers Hornsby, on the Braves. Sisler will hit .340 for the remainder
of the season.

1930
Like furniture. The Reds swap Ethan Allen and Pete Donohue to the Giants for
INF Pat Crawford. Allen is hitting .217 but will rebound with the Giants
and finish the season with a .292 average, the same as last season. In
his decade with the Reds, Donohue won 127 games, but the 30-year-old has
struggled the past 3 seasons with arm problems. Crawford will be sold at
the end of the season to the Cards.

1931
AL Secretary Will Harridge is elected to succeed E. S. Barnard as president
of the league.

The Giants surge past the Cards to move into first place, beating Boston 7-4.

1933

against New York. The Yankees storm back with 12 runs in the bottom half
of the 8th inning with Bill Dickey's grand slam the big blow. The combined

Sox, 9-2.

1935
The Red Sox get Oscar Melillo, star 2B, from the Browns, for Moose Solters
and $35,000. Solters will make the trade look good, hitting .330 on the
year with 104 RBI and become the first American Leaguer to collect 200 hits
while playing for 2 teams. Only Irish Meusel, in the NL, has done it.

Rookie Pretzel Puzzullo makes his first start for the Phils and beats the
Pirates, 4-2. Manager Jimmie Wilson likes it so much, he'll start Pretzel
tomorrow as well. The Pirates will beat him, 3-1. Puzzullo is the only
pitcher ever to makes his first two starts on consecutive days.

1936
Carl Hubbell beats the Dodgers, 5-4, in 12 innings for his 6th win, as the
Giants tie the Cardinals for first place.

Cleveland OF Bruce Campbell is released from the hospital after a 3rd
attack of spinal meningitis. Cleveland wins today, 12-2, over the Browns
with Billy Sullivan collecting 5 safeties and Hal Trosky hitting his 10th
HR, a triple and single.

1937

when the Giants beat Cincinnati, 3-2. Mel Ott's ninth-inning home run proves
to be the difference in the Crosley Field contest.

Tobin for Manny Salvo, while the Giants take out starter Hal Schumacher,
replacing him with Carl Hubbell. Hubbell's single wins it for New York, 2-1.

a 30-day suspension for umpire pushing. This occurred in the 3rd game of
the World Series when Crosetti pushed Bill Summers.

1945
The White Sox get only 3 hits total in a doubleheader loss to the Red
Sox. Boo Ferriss allows only a single - by Tony Cuccinello in the 2nd - in

O'Neill gives up 2 singles in the nitecap to win, 2-1.

After losing 9 straight to the Browns over 2 seasons, the Yanks brush aside
the jinx to sweep a pair, winning 10-9 and 3-1. The Browns blow an 8-2 lead

Recently retired slugger Hank Greenberg buys an interest in the Cleveland
club, becoming the Indians 2nd-largest stockholder.

The Yankees pound 14 hits to the A's 7, but come up short, 6-5. It is the
first-place A's 7th straight win. A hit and run single in the 8th scores
Sam Chapman all the way from 1B. Phil Rizzuto and Hank Majeski match homeruns.

Bob Lemon keeps the Indians a game in back of the A's by stopping the
White Sox, 4-0, on 4 hits. Lemon, who shut out Washington 4 days ago,
has not been scored on in 23 innings.

1949
The Indians start so badly, 12-17, that owner Bill Veeck arranges a "2nd

4-0. The Indians do rise to 2nd place, within 2 1/2 games of the top,
but they will finish 3rd, 8 games back.

1951
A large ad appears in the Minnesota Sunday Times asking the local fans for
their continued support of the Millers despite the promotion of the team's
phenom to the major leagues. Giants owner Horace Stoneham explains Willie
Mays' performance, .477 batting average and hitting safely in 33 of 35 games,
has warranted the young outfielder's move to the Polo Grounds in New York.

1953
Eddie Lopat beats the Senators for the 8th straight time as he allows 3
hits in a 3-1 Yankee win. Collins, Martin and Berra hit solo homers for

in the '34 Series."

1956
Thanks to a dropped 3rd strike by C Hobie Landrith, P Jim Davis of the
Cubs fans 4 straight Cardinals in the 6th inning. Wally Moon leads off the
inning with a double and then steals 3B. The knuckler then K's Hal Smith
and Jackie Brandt. His 3rd strike on Lindy McDaniel eludes Landrith, and
the pitcher reaches first while Moon scores. Don Blasingame then strikes
out for the 4th strikeout in the inning. Not since Guy Morton, in 1916,
has a pitcher fanned 4 in one inning. But the Cubs still lose, 11-9. The
Cards pummel the Cubs in the 2nd game as well, winning 12-2.

1959
League President Warren Giles rules that the final score of the Harvey Haddix

Since there is no rule limiting the size or shape of the catcher's mitt,
Baltimore manager Paul Richards combats the passed-ball problem while
catching Hoyt Wilhelm (38 in 1959; 11 so far this year) by devising an
oversized mitt to gather in Hoyt's fluttering knuckler. It is half again
as large as the standard glove and 40 ounces heavier. Wilhelm goes the
distance in beating New York 3-2 at Yankee Stadium. Courtney has no passed
balls behind the plate, nor are there any wild pitches.

Ed Bailey snaps a 5-5 tie with a 9th inning grand slam as the Reds defeat the
visiting Braves, 9-5. Pinson's 2nd triple of the game set up 2 intentional

his 3rd loss to Boston this year.

1964

1966
The White Sox trade 1B/OF Danny Cater to the A's for IF Wayne Causey.

Rice has a HR and 5 RBIs, while Carl Yastrzemski, Carlton Fisk, Dwight
Evans and George Scott also homer. For the Royals Hal MacRae contributes a
double, triple and homer to drive in 4 runs. MacRae will end the year as
just the 4th player this century to top 50 doubles (54), 10 triples (11)
and 20 homers (21) in a season. Only Lou Gehrig (1927), Chuck Klein (1932),
and Joe Medwick (1937) have previously reached those levels. In 2006 Grady
Sizemore of the Cleveland Indians will become the first player in the 21st
Century to attain those marks.

1980
In the 3rd inning at Riverfront Stadium, Don Sutton serves up consecutive
homers to Ken Griffey, George Foster and Dan Driessen. The homer outage is

had no homers this year prior to the streak.

With Kansas City ahead 7-4 over the Mariners, Amos Otis taps a dribbler
down the 3B line in the 6th inning. Mariner 3B Lenny Randle gets down on all
fours as the ball rolls along the line, finally going foul. Royals manager

baseman argues he was merely pleading with it. Ump Larry McCoy rules in favor
of Herzog and Otis gets a hit. Otis doesn't score but the Royals win, 8-5.

1984
At Seattle, the Mariners top the Tigers, 5-1, for their 3rd straight win over
the front-runners. The M's have 14 hits, including 5 hit-and-run singles,
to beat Dan Petry. Mike Young takes the win. The Tigers now lead the Blue
Jays and Orioles by 5 games.

At Chicago, the Reds edge the Cubs 4-3 in a contest protested by both
clubs. Ron Cey belts a 3rd inning blow originally called a homer by umpire
Rippley. The Reds argue the call and, after an ump conference, the ruling is
a foul. The Cubs then protest. The umps then huddle with Reds manager Rapp
and tell him that P Mario Soto is ejected from the game. Soto charges the
field tackling Cubs coach Don Zimmer and then gets re-ejected. Both teams
then file a protest.

1986
The Indians have base runners on first and second with two outs in the bottom
of the sixth inning when the game is delayed due to a dense fog coming off

the country.

before the Rockies game in Houston. The Rockies were going to release Murphy
to make room for Chris Jones. Murphy hit no homers in his brief time with
the Rockies. Murphy was hitting just .143 in 26 games for the Rockies. The
two-time National League MVP leaves the game with a career average of .265,
398 homeruns and 1,266 RBIs.

1994
The Silver Bullets defeat the Richfield Rockets, 7-2, before a crowd of

injuries, has his 2nd 5-hit game of the year. The Yankees, down 5-4 after 4
innings, jump on former teammate Jim Abbott (1-8) and two relievers to score

1997
In a complete-game effort, Steve Ontiveros limits the Yankees to one hit
in the A's 3-0 victory at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. The 34-year-old
right-hander's bid for a no-hitter is spoiled by a two-out sixth inning
single by Luis Polonia.

Barry Larkin's streak of consecutively reaching base of 13 - one shy of
the NL record - is stopped by Curt Schilling, who goes all the way to beat
Cincinnati, 2-1. Larkin singles in the first inning, but flies out in the
3rd to end his streak one shy of Pedro Guerrero's NL record set in 1985.

Kansas City takes a 2-0 lead into the ninth before the visiting A's -
held to one hit for eight-plus innings by Jose Rosado - get a two-run
homer from Mark McGwire and a solo shot from Scott Spiezio to take the
lead. Pinch-hitter Scott Cooper's homer in the bottom of the ninth then
ties it. The A's bat around in the 10th, scoring 5 runs, and the Royals'
three-run answer falls short as the A's win, 8-6.

Mariner reliever Norm Charlton walks Chuck Knoblauch with the bases loaded,
as Minnesota caps a six-run ninth-inning rally to win, 11-10. Seattle's
collapse mars a game in which Ken Griffey Jr and Joey Cora each set
records. Griffey hits his 23rd homer, breaking his own major league mark
for homers through May. The Mariner outfielder had established the record
in 1994. Cora is 4 for 6 to extend his hitting streak to a team-record 22
games, and also ties the AL mark for switch-hitters.

1999
The Tigers defeat the White Sox, 10-5, as Detroit DH Luis Polonia strokes
5 hits, including a pair of doubles. Polonia was called up from the minors
yesterday.

2000
The Cardinals pay tribute to Hall of Fame hurler Dizzy Dean by dedicating
a statue, created by sculptor Harry Weber, outside of Busch Stadium. The
colorful character joins Enos Slaughter, Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Stan Musial
and Red Schoendienst to be honored in such a manner by the Redbirds.

The Reds retire the No. 24 jersey worn by Hall of Famer Tony Perez, marking
just the sixth time the oldest professional baseball organization has bestowed
the honor. The former first baseman and manager joins Fred Hutchinson (1),
Johnny Bench (5), Joe Morgan (8), Ted Kluszewski (18) and Frank Robinson
(20) to be honored in such a manner. Ken Griffey Jr after being acquired by
the Reds in the off season agrees to switch his uniform number from 24 to
30, the number worn by his father as a member of the Big Red Machine. The
Marlins defeat the Reds, 8-6, today.

2001
Against the Rockies' Denny Neagle in the 1st inning, Barry Bonds of the San
Francisco Giants hits the franchise's 12,000th homerun. It is Bonds' 26th
of the year. Only the Yankees have hit more. Neagle gives up all 5 runs,
including solos to Armando Rios and Rich Aurilia, in the 5-4 loss to SF.

2002
The Dodgers best the Brewers, 5-3, with the help of Shawn Green's 10th HR
in 7 days.

2003
In Atlanta, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upholds a decision that
prevents the Florida attorney general from investigating the 2001 attempt
by MLB to eliminate two teams. The 11th circuit decision of Judges Gerald
B. Tjoflat, Susan H. Black and Richard W. Goldberg, considered to be a major
victory by the commissioner's office, is based on the Fourth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution and state law rather than the sport's antitrust exemption.

The Yankees beat the Red Sox, 11-3, ending Nomar Garciaparra's 26-game
hitting streak in the process.

The Mariners wallop the Royals, 15-7, led by Randy Winn, who strokes 5 hits,
including a double.

2004
After beating the Oakland A's, Curt Schilling, on his way home from Fenway,
calls the cops on his cell phone to report an erratic driver. The Westwood
Police Department apprehended the driver and pulled him over.

At Kauffman Stadium, the Tigers down the Royals, 17-7, tying a team record
in the process by stroking 27 hits. The first time time Detroit banged out
that many hits in a game was against the Yankees at the end of the 1928
season at Navin Field. Carlos Pena goes 6 for 6 in the contest, with 5
RBIs. Pena powers two homers, a double and three singles in the game while
batting eighth. The first baseman's six-hit effort made him just the 18th
major-leaguer to register both a six-hit and a three-homer game during his
career. Pena also became the first player in over 100 years to register six
hits in a game while batting eighth. Wilbert "Uncle Robbie" Robinson was the
last before Pena when he rapped out six hits in a game from the eight hole
in 1892. Shawn Green was the last player to garner six hits and three dingers
in the same game when he registered six knocks and four long balls in 2002.

2005
The Mets defeat the Marlins, 12-4. SS Jose Reyes clouts 2 triples for New
York, giving him 7 in his last 10 games. It is the most triples hit in 10
games by any major leaguer.

Cubs P Mark Prior has to leave the game in the 4th inning after being
hit in the elbow by a line drive off the bat of Brad Hawpe. A MRI shows
a fracture that will sideline the ace indefinitely, but he will be back
in action next month. Todd Wellemeyer fills in to earn the 10-3 win over
the Rockies. Derrek Lee hits two homers, Neifi Perez has a HR and 4 RBI,
and Corey Patterson adds a solo shot.

2006
Derek Jeter, with a run-producing single off KC's Jeremy Affeldt, becomes the
eighth player in Yankee history to collect 2,000 career hits. The 31-year-old
shortstop joins Yogi Berra, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Don
Mattingly, Babe Ruth and Bernie Williams in reaching the milestone.

Curt Schilling and the Red Sox beat the Devil Rays, 6-4, making the
right-handed hurler the 104th player to amass 200 victores. Pitching a
perfect ninth inning, Jonathan Papelbon establishes a rookie record by
recording his 18th save in 18 tries.

The Pirates edge the Astros, 8-7, in 18 innings. Jason Bay hits a homer in
his 5th consecutive game for Pittsburgh, the first Pirate player to do so
in 50 years.

Twins rookie Boof Bonser allows three 1st inning singles, then gets three
swinging K's to escape without a score. He's not so lucky in the 2nd,
allowing 4 runs, but that is all the Mariners can muster off him as the
Twins win, 9-5, scoring 7 runs in 6 innings off of Jamie Moyer. The Twins
are helped by a triple play in the 8th.

2008
With a 44-0 record and needing just one more win to become the first
undefeated team in N.C.A.A. baseball history, Trinity College loses to
Johns Hopkins 4-3. The loss sets up a winner-take-all in the Division III
World Series in which the Hartford-based school scores a pair of runs in
the bottom of the ninth to win the game, 5-4, and the national championship.

When Jamie Carroll is caught off first base by White Sox pitcher Ehren
Wasserman's fake throw to third and gets into a rundown, David Dellucci,
the runner on third, breaks for home and scores on first baseman Paul
Konerko's throw in the dirt which also allows Carroll to reach second
and Grady Sizemore, the runner on second, to move third base. Chuck Murr,
official scorer of the Indians' 8-2 victory over the White Sox, credits
all three runners with stolen bases making it the first triple steal to be
accomplished since 1987 when Atlanta pull it off against Houston.

2009
Gerry Rodriguez completes his cycle with a tenth inning walk-off home
run. The minor leaguer's four hits helps pace the Rome Braves to a 4-3
victory over the Greenville Drive in South Atlantic League action.

Red Sox starter Daisuke Matsuzaka and two relievers combine to throw six
wild pitches making it only the fifth time since 1900 that the dubious feat
has been accomplished. Dice K ties an 80-year club mark franchise with four
errant throws to catcher George Kottaras with relievers Manny Delcarmen
and Justin Masterson each uncorking one.

2010
Houston's Lance Berkman walks for the 1000th career time against the Milwaukee
Brewers in the 5th inning by David Bush. Berkman became the 110th player
to reach this mark.
