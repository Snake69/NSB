May 25

1901
During a fluke snowstorm in Cleveland, Ted Lewis becomes the first Boston
American (Red Sox) hurler to throw a shutout when he blanks the Tribe
at League Park, 5-0. The 28-year-old right-hander from Wales will become
better known later in life as the president of Massachusetts State College
and the University of New Hampshire.

1906
Jesse Tannehill snaps the Boston Americans' 20-game losing streak - 19 at
home - with a 3-0 win over the White Sox. Jesse's batterymate, Bob Peterson,
drives in all the runs in a game that takes 1 hour 15 minutes. Both of
these loss streaks by Boston are AL records. The Americans will finish the
season with a woeful 49-105 record. Both Boston teams will finish last,
while both Chicago teams finish first. It's the first time 2 cities have
had 2 winners and 2 cellar-dwellers, and it won't happen again until 1921,
when New York has the winners, and Philadelphia the last-placers.

1907
The Giants bust Irv Young for 6 runs in the 8th inning to beat Boston,
9-1. McGinnity in relief of Mathewson, now 7-1, gets a save.

1908
Detroit scores an unearned run in the 3rd against Washington lefty Bill Burns,
but not until 2 are out in the 9th does a Tiger collect a base hit. Germany
Schaefer singles to center off "Sleepy Bill" for the only Bengal hit as
Detroit wins, 1-0. Washington will lose 29 games this year by shutouts,
an AL record.

At Chicago, the Cubs treat Mathewson rudely, roughing him up for 7 hits
and 5 runs in 2 innings. The Giants rally but lose in 10 innings, 8-7,
as Hooks Wiltse takes the loss.

1909
Righthander George Mullin wins his 9th in a row for Detroit 7-4 over
Washington, on his way to a league-leading 29-8 record.

Orval Overall, in relief of Jack Pfiester, picks up the win in Chicago's
4-3 win over Brooklyn. Harry McIntire takes the loss.

1910
In the nightcap of a twin bill in Chicago, Jack Coombs' scoreless streak
ends at 53 innings during a 5-2 loss in a game shortened by darkness. The
A's right-hander will throw 13 shutouts in 38 games he starts and will
finish the season with a 31-9 record and an ERA of 1.30.

1911
The Tigers lose to Walter Johnson and the Senators, 6-2, although Cobb
nicks him for 2 hits.

In St. Louis, Grover Alexander beats the Cards, 4-3, to stop the Phillies'
6-game loss streak. The Card score 3 in the 9th, but Pete hangs on for
the win.

1912
New York SS Jack Martin gets plunked twice by Walter Johnson, who hits three
batters in the game. The second time Martin is hit the fast ball shatters
his jaw. He will be out of action for five weeks. Johnson, who consciously
avoids throwing at batters will, nevertheless, hit 205 batters in his career.

1917
Down 5-0 in the 9th, Tris Speaker of the Indians ignites a rally by stealing
home against the Yankees. Five more runs follow and they win 6-5.

1919
White Sox CF Happy Felsch starts a triple play in the 8th inning to stop
the Senators scoring threat, then the Sox score a pair in the bottom of
the frame off Walter Johnson and derail the Big Train, 5-4.

1920
At the Polo Grounds, the Yanks top the Tigers 4-3 with Babe Ruth's 2 run
HR providing the margin. It's the Babe's 8th HR of the year, breaking a
tie for the AL lead with Chicago's Happy Felsch.

A's rookie Roy Moore stops the White Sox, 5-1, and drives in 3 runs. Two
of the runs come in on a homer, while Frank Walker adds his 6th homer of
the year. This is Moore's only victory of the year as he loses his next 13
to end at 1-13.

The Reds Rube Bressler makes his first start of season, pitching 2 innings. He
singles in the Reds 5-run 2nd, then snaps his ankle sliding into 2B. Dolf
Luque takes the mound and coasts to an 11-2 win over the visiting Braves.

1921
In St. Louis, the Browns overcome Babe Ruth's 13th HR of the year to win,
7-6. The Babe's blow travels an estimated 500 feet.

1922
Babe Ruth is suspended one day and fined $200 for throwing dirt on ump George
Hildebrand after being called out at 2B while trying to stretch a single in
the 3rd. Babe then goes into the stands after a heckler and is restrained by
GM Ed Barrow. He finishes his tirade by standing on the dugout roof calling
the crowd "yellow" cowards. On his way to the CF clubhouse Ruth gestures
to another heckler in RF. Babe gets stripped of his title as team captain
as a result (which he held less than a week). New York beats the visiting
Nationals, 6-4.

In the 1st inning of game 1 against the Robins, Phillies pitcher Bill Hubbell
is hit in the head by a line drive off the bat of Tommy Griffith and fractures
his skull. Hubbell will return to pitch in 35 games this year. Brooklyn
sweeps a pair, winning 8-7 and 9-6, as Jimmy Johnston hits for the cycle.

The U.S. Supreme Court, in a resounding 9-0 decision, rule that baseball
is not an interstate business. The suit had been brought by the Federal
League's Baltimore franchise.

1923
Crossing the plate for the 1,741st time, Ty Cobb surpasses Honus Wagner's
record for most runs score in a career. The 'Georgia Peach' will tally
2,245 runs during his 24-year tenure in the major leagues, a mark which
will not be equaled until 2001 when Rickey Henderson breaks the record.
Cobb's Tigers lose to Chicago today, 5-3.

1924
The Red Sox' 6-5 win over the Yankees deadlocks the 2 at the AL top. They'll
run neck and neck until June 14th when the Sox begin to unravel.

1926
Six games in the AL today produce 145 hits and 80 runs. Leading the way
are the Senators and A's in Philadelphia with the Senators taking the first
game 17-12, and losing the second game, 7-6. The Nats score 11 runs in the
5th inning and hold on for the victory. Mickey Cochrane homers in game 2
with a pair on.

1929
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants belt 4 homers - 2 by Jackson and one each
by Roush and Walsh - to whip the Braves, 10-3. Roush's HR is the 2,000th
in Giants history.

1931
The A's win their 17th in a row, 2 behind the White Sox' AL record,
beating the Yankees 4-2 and 16-4 at Philadelphia. Grove wins the opener
and Mahaffey coasts to the win in the nitecap. Cochrane and Chapman match
homers in the opener, while Foxx is the only batter to leave the park in
game 2. The streak, the 4th (tied) longest of the century, ends tomorrow
when Lefty Gomez stops the A's 6-2. The A's are in first place by 5 games.

1933
Lefty Grove of the A's tops the Tigers, 4-3, for his 13th straight win over
Detroit stretching back to August 20, 1930 (as noted by Frank Williams).

1934
The Red Sox get Wes Ferrell, who was suspended by the Indians, for $25,000
and pitcher Bob Weiland and Bob Seeds. Dick Porter also goes to the Sox in
the deal. Porter had no homers last year, but hit one in his first at-bat
this season.

1935
Babe Ruth has a last hurrah, hitting 3 homeruns at Pittsburgh. The first
shot is hit off Red Lucas, while the last two homers come off veteran Guy
Bush. The final one, the last of his 714 career HRs, is the first to clear
the RF grandstand at Forbes Field and is measured at 600 feet. With that,
Ruth sits down in the dugout - Pittsburgh's - next to rookie Mace Brown. Ruth,
who hit 3 homers in a game just once in the AL (May 21, 1930), is the first
player to turn this hat trick in both leagues. Ruth lifts himself in the 7th
inning, finishing the day at 4 for 4 and 6 RBIs. But Ruth's old teammate Waite
Hoyt, in relief of Bush, is the winner as Pittsburgh defeats the hapless
Braves, 11-7. Here is Robert Creamer's account of the Babe's last homerun
in his 1974 book, "Babe":  "[Guy] Bush said, 'I never saw a ball hit so hard
before or since. He was fat and old, but he still had that great swing. Even
when he missed, you could hear the bat go swish. I can't remember anything
about the first homerun he hit off me that day. I guess it was just another
homer. But I can't forget that last one. It's probably still going. It was
unbelievably long, completely over the roof of the double-decked stands in
right field and out of the park. Nobody had ever hit a ball over the roof
in Forbes Field before.' Gus Miller, the head usher, went to investigate,
and was told the ball landed on the roof of one house, bounced onto another
and then into a lot, where a boy picked it up and ran off with it. Miller
measured the distance from the first house back to home plate and said it
was 600 feet. His measurement may have been imprecise, but it was still
the longest homerun ever hit in Pittsburgh." Forbes Field expert Dan Bonk,
said in 2002 that the head usher had the wrong address for the Babe blast,
and that the hit was very close to the foul line. It landed in a yard of
a one-story house that today is painted in the blue and yellow Pirate colors.

At Boston, Detroit wins, 3-2, on Hank Greenberg's 2-run homer in the 6th
inning. In his previous at-bat in the 4th inning, Greenberg's line drive
hits pitcher Fritz Ostermueller breaking his cheekbone and several teeth
and sending him to the hospital.

1937
After hitting a solo HR against the Yankees in his third-inning at-bat off
Bump Hadley to break a 1-1 tie, player-manager Mickey Cochrane is hit by
a 3-1 pitch from Hadley in the 5th inning and suffers a skull fracture in
three places. Near death at first, the Tiger catcher/manager will spend six
weeks in the hospital. Coach Del Baker will run the team for the hospitalized
Detroit leader, who will never return to active play. Cochrane's homer is
his last at-bat. In the hospital, Cochrane will exonerate Hadley saying,
"I lost the ball." The Yanks win the game, 4-3, beating Schoolboy Rowe,
who makes his first appearance of the season following a suspension for
lack of conditioning.

1938
The Tigers use the long ball to defeat the Yankees, 7-3, at Detroit. Rudy
York and Hank Greenberg hit back-to-back homers twice in the game.

1939
In his last three at-bats against the Red Sox' Emerson Dickson, Cleveland's
Ken Keltner belts 3 homers in an 11-0 romp at Fenway. It's the 11th time that
an AL batter has hit 3 successive homers. Feller makes it easy, pitching
a one-hitter for the win. Bobby Doerr's 2nd inning single for Boston is
the only hit against Rapid Robert ... it'll be one of two one-hitters of
Feller's in which Doerr has the only hit.

1941
In a 10-3 victory over New York at Yankee Stadium, Red Sox left fielder
Ted Williams goes 4 for 5 and raises his batting average over .400 for the
first time during the season. His run to be the first since Bill Terry in
1930 to exceed the magic number will be marked in newspapers throughout
the season, although it will often give way to the batting streak by Joe
DiMaggio. DiMag singles today, off Boston's Lefty Grove. Grove thus joins
two of baseball's most famous streaks - Joe's current hitting streak and
Ruth's 60 homers in 1927. Lefty served up a gopher on September 27, 1927.
The 'Spendid Splinter' will finished this campaign batting .406.

Pete Reiser hits his only career grand slam to pace the Dodgers to an 8-4
win over the Phils. Reiser's HR comes off Ike Pearson, who had beaned him
just a month earlier.

1942
A pulled muscle ends a 652-game playing streak for Cincinnati 1B Frank
McCormick as the Reds' Paul Derringer stops the Pirates, 6-1. Hank Sauer
plays 1B.

1944
On Mel Harder appreciation night in Cleveland, the Indians and Harder
drop a 4-2 decision to the Senators. Mel tries harder scoring both of the
Indian runs.

1945
Red Sox CF Leon Culberson makes an unassisted DP when he catches a
short looper and continues on to 2B to nab Vern Stephens before he can
return. Despite the play, the Red Sox lose to the Browns, 5-0. Nels Potter
records the shutout.

1946
The first place Dodgers whip the Phillies, 7-1, for their 14th straight
win at Shibe Park. Augie Galan has a single, a double and a triple, and is
involved in an unusual "catcher's balk" play. Augie is at-bat when Reiser,
on 3B, breaks for home on an attempted steal. Phils C Andy Seminick tips
Galan's bat on the play and umpire Al Barlick calls the balk. Reiser is
awarded a steal of home and Galan gets 1B. The Dodgers will sweep a pair
tomorrow at Shibe.

1947
The Yankees edge into 3rd place ahead of the Red Sox, whipping Boston,
17-2. Ted Williams' 2-run homer in the 9th off Floyd Bevans deprives the
Yankees of 4 straight shutouts, George Stirnweiss scores 5 runs and King
Kong Keller 4 runs in the 17-hit attack. Joe DiMaggio has 4 hits and 3 runs.

Joe Medwick returns to the Cardinals after a 7-year absence. Signed just
before the doubleheader, Medwick pinch-hits a double in game 2 to account
for the only run in a 2-1 loss to the Reds. Ducky has lost his power from
his St. Louis heyday, but he will hit .307 as a PH and OF against lefthanders.

In the Giants 9-3 win over the Braves, Giant Buddy Kerr bungles a hard
grounder from Bob Elliott for his first error in 384 chances and 69 games,
the NL record to date for SS.

1950
The Red Sox outhit the Browns, 19-15, and out-score to win, 15-12. Boston
scores 10 runs in the last 3 innings. Walt Dropo drives in 6 runs, 4 with
a grand slam in the 8th. It is his 10th HR since joining the Sox on May 3.

The Athletics make some changes. Connie Mack's son, Earle, who had been
assistant manager, assumes the duties of chief scout. Earle, who had hoped to
succeed his father as manager, is replaced by Jimmie Dykes. Mickey Cochrane is
named general manager. It doesn't help today as the Yanks extend their winning
streak to 9 games by defeating the A's, 2-0, behind Ed Lopat and Joe Page.

The Oakland Oaks of the PCL buy recalcitrant OF Dick Wakefield from the
Yanks. New York will not allow him to buy out his own contract.

1951
At Shibe Park, the much-heralded Giant rookie Willie Mays makes his major
league debut against the Phillies. The 20-year-old outfielder, who hit .477
in 35 games with the Minneapolis Millers before being called up, goes hitless
in five trips to the plate, but makes two outstanding defensive plays to
contribute to New York's 8-5 victory. He strikes out in his first at-bat,
against Bubba Church.

1953
In game 2 of a doubleheader, enroute to a 10-3 Braves victory over Cincinnati
at County Stadium, Max Surkont establishes a major league record by striking
out eight consecutive batters, a feat which will not be surpassed until
future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver mows down ten straight San Diego hitters in
1970. After his streak reaches seven, the Milwaukee moundsman has to endure
a thirty-five minute rain delay before getting Andy Seminick, leading off
in the fifth inning, to look at a third strike to set the mark. Surkont
fans 13 on the way to his 6th straight win. The Braves take the opener,
5-1, behind Don Liddle.

The Yankees and Red Sox play the longest 9-inning game to date, lasting 3
hours 52 minutes. Boston lefty Mickey McDermott take 2 hours 45 minutes to
pitch 6 of the innings, as Boston outlasts New York, 14-10. Mantle hits an
opposite field homer off McDermott.

a team record that will be broken by Spahn in 10 years. He helps his own cause
with a homer, off loser Herm Wehmeier. It is the Braves 8th win in a row.

At New York, the Giants explode for 11 runs in the 8th inning to overwhelm
the Pirates, 21-4. The Buccos score 3 in the top of the 8th for a NL record
for the frame. Led by Lockman's grand slam, the Giants score 5 in the 7th,
then collect 8 hits in the 8th, including 2 homers. Johnny Antonelli has
his 6th win and hits his first ML HR. Davey Williams has a single and HR
in the 8th. Willie Mays scores 5 runs.

Billy Pierce and Virgil Trucks combine to give the White Sox a 4-2 win over
the Indians, and stop Cleveland's 11-game win streak. Bob Lemon takes the
loss. Cleveland's Al Smith steals a base off Sherman Lollar, the last base
runner to swipe one this year. The Sox catcher will throw out the next 18
base runners who try.

the Red Sox have done it.

1979
