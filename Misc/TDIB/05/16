Two deaf-mutes face each other for the first time and only time when Dummy
Hoy leads off for the Reds against Dummy Taylor of the Giants. Leadoff
batter Hoy greets Taylor with "I'm glad to see you" in sign language. The
Giants win 5-3 with a 5-run rally in the 9th. Hoy goes 2 for 4, the only
Reds batter to collect 2 hits.

The Browns' Dick Padden has the lone hit against White Sox hurler Wiley
Piatt as Chicago wins, 2-1.

Boston's Tenney and Pittsburgh manager Clarke get into a fight in the 8th
inning of Pittsburgh's 5-1 win. Both are ejected. Pittsburgh also releases
pitcher George Merritt, 3-0 last year. His release is not a result of
threats to enforce the 16-man rule, but rather that Clarke did not need him.

1903
A record 31,500 at the Polo Grounds see the Giants beat Pittsburgh, 7-3,
behind Christy Mathewson. Matty allows 8 hits in beating William Kennedy,
who is bricked for 13 safeties. The first-place New Yorkers will soon fade,
and the Pirates, now in 3rd place, will win their 3rd straight pennant.

1904
The Pirates overcome a 5-0 deficit against Mathewson by scoring a run in
the 5th and 5 more in the 6th for a 6-5 win.

1905
Red Ames stops Chicago, 4-0, the 3rd shut-out in a row over Chicago by
the Giants. His opponent is Ed Reulbach, making his ML debut and allowing
just 5 hits. Reulbach, called "the greatest of all college pitchers" after
a stellar season at Notre Dame in 1904 and switching to the University of
Vermont for 1905. Reulbach set a college strikeout record in 1904 and beat
Syracuse University, 1-0, on May 12. Despite missing a month he will finish
this year at 18-14 (Total Baseball numbers).

1906
The visiting Giants, clad in their new all-black uniforms, are sliced up by
the Pirates, 11-0. The Bucs tally 15 hits to back sinkerballer Vic Willis,

team, 6-5.

1907
The Highlanders swap P Walter Clarkson and OF Frank Delahanty - both siblings
of future Hall of Famers - to Cleveland for P Earl Moore. New York is hoping
that Moore will return to the form he showed before a Highlander line drive
injured his foot in August of 1905. But after making just six appearances
this season, New York will waive him to the Phillies where he will regain
his form in 1909. New York loses to Detroit today, 1-0.

1908
Andy Coakley gives up 6 hits in beating the Giants in Cincinnati,
6-1. Mathewson lasts just 2 innings and McGraw pinch hits for him in the 3rd.

1909
With two outs in the 9th, Detroit's George Moriarty tries to steal home but
is tagged out by Boston catcher Bill Carrigan to end the game, a 3-2 Boston
win. Carrigan then spits tobacco on Moriarty, saying, "don't try that and
pull that on a smart guy." Moriarty then flattens Carrigan and the two of
them will be suspended by the AL for fighting.

NL President John Heydler calls a meeting with the league's umpires to discuss
ways that the new two-umpire system can prevent fighting by the players. A
serious incident occurred several days earlier in Boston when Reds catcher
Frank Roth attacked umpire Steve Cusack after a play at home. Several other
Reds players threatened the umpire with baseball bats.

1912
Due to his assault on Claude Lucker, a handicapped fan and a regular heckler,
Ty Cobb is suspended. Although today's game is rained out, the Tigers meet in
Philadelphia voting to boycott if the 'Georgia Peach' is not allowed to play.

1913
Alfredo Cabrera, born in the Canary Islands, becomes the first person from
Spain to appear in the majors. The 32-year-old Cardinals shortstop will go
0 for 2 in the only big league game he will play, a 6-5 loss to the Dodgers
at Ebbets Field.

Pirates OF Ed Mensor will draw 8 walks all year, but one of them comes
in the 3rd inning against New York, ending Mathewson's string of perfect
control at 47 innings. Mathewson takes a 7-1 lead into the 8th, but Ham
Hyatt roasts a fastball into the RF stands to lead off and the Bucs follow
with 5 singles. Matty holds on for a 7-4 win.

1914
Giants' spitballer Jeff Tesreau's no-hit bid against Pittsburgh is spoiled
with two outs in the 9th when Joe Kelly lines a single. Tesreau retires
the last batter to win, 2-0.

1915
In Cleveland, the Red Sox score 3 in the 14th to win, 3-0.

1917
Thanks to a scoring change made after the game by a panel of sportswriters
reversing a first inning hit into an error, Bob Groom of the Browns no-hits
the White Sox, 4-0. Ernie Koob, his St. Louis teammate, also threw a
no-hitter yesterday against the Pale Hose.

1918
At Washinton, the Nats knock Chicago's Joe Benz out of the box in the 1st
inning, scoring 2 runs, but reliever Dan Danforth holds Washington scoreless
from the 1st to the 11th as the Sox win, 4-2.

1920
Before an overflow house of 38,000 - their biggest crowd since 1911 at the
Polo Grounds - the Indians jump on Carl Mays for 5 runs in the 1st inning
and coast to an 8-2 win over the Yankees. Jim Bagby is the winner, allowing
only a single run until the 9th when Ruth doubles home the second score.

At Chicago, Pete Alexander wins his 7th straight, defeating the Braves
5-1. Boston's one run is unearned.

At Cincinnati, the Phils break their 9-game losing streak by beating the
Reds, 3-2, in 15 innings. Eppa Rixey pitches a complete game for Philley,
finally winning his own game with a sacrifice fly. Jimmy Ring pitches 15
innings to take the loss.

1921

with 4 hits, 4 runs and a stolen base.

During the 7-4 Giants win over the Reds at the Polo Grounds, Giants fan,
Reuben Berman, refuses to return a foul ball, and he is detained, given
his ticket price back, and ejected from the park. Berman sues for $20,000
and wins a $100 claim in court. The Giants will then allow fans to keep
foul balls. The Cubs were the first to institute the policy, in 1916. The
Pirates will follow suit in two months.

1924
The visiting Giants club the Cubs, 16-12, with Claude Jonnard winning over

In Boston, Mel Ott hits for the cycle in New York's 5-4 10-inning loss to the
Braves in a doubleheader nitecap. Ott's HR in the 7th lands half-way up in
the RF bleachers, the longest HR to that section since 1915. Joe Dugan matches
Ott's 4 hits and scores the winner. The Braves also win the opener, 4-3.

Cleveland pitcher Jake Miller allows his 1st run in 27 innings, giving up
a pair of singles for a run in the 9th against the Browns. And that is the
game, a 1-0 loss, as General Crowder takes the shutout win, allowing 2 hits.

1930
Washington wins a doubleheader from Philadelphia and moves into first
place. Bump Hadley wins the opener, 5-3, and Ad Liska adds a 3-hit 4-0
shutout in the nitecap, beating Earnshaw. Joe Judge's 3-run homer in the
8th puts the game away.

and dropping the Bombers into 2nd place.

1932
The Yankees record their 4th straight shutout to equal the record set by
Cleveland and Boston in 1903 and 1906. Johnny Allen, George Pipgras, Red
Ruffing and Lefty Gomez are the hurlers. Lefty stops Cleveland on 5 hits
to win, 8-0, New York's 5th shutout in 7 games.

1933
In a 12-inning contest against the Indians, the Senators' 19-year-old rookie
Cecil Travis gets five hits in his major league debut joining Fred Clarke
as the only other player to do so. The two teams establish a major league

winner over Mel Harder.

1934
The Reds send pitcher Syl Johnson and OF Johnny Moore to the Phils for

1936
The Cubs' Phil Cavaretta poles a grand slam in the 8th inning off Bucky
Walters to power his team to a 7-3 win over the Phillies. The Phils argue,
to no avail, that Cav's homer is foul.

Pittsburgh P Waite Hoyt has an emergency appendectomy.

1937
Browns 3B Harlond Clift equals the AL record with 9 assists in a 5-4 loss to
the Tigers. A fumble and late throw in the 1st inning would have given him a
10th assist. By the end of the season, Clift will set a new record for total
chances and 405 assists (the assists record will be broken in 1971 by Graig
Nettles). Tigers Gee Walker has a single to run his hit streak to 21 games.

A sac fly by Chick Hafey in the 9th gives the Reds a 3-2 win over the
Cubs. Hafey makes his 1st appearance since retiring in May of 1935.

consecutive games umpired at 1,710.

39,571 and Shibe Park is tops in the AL with 38,728 watching the A's-Yankees.

1939
With half of the expected crowd on-hand due to the cold weather, only 15,109
fans at Shibe Park see the Indians defeat the A's, 8-3 in 10 innings, in
the first night game ever played in the American League. Johnny Humphries
is the winner over Roy Parmalee. The Reds' became the first major league
team to host an evening tilt in 1935.

Crosetti. New York then rallies in the 9th to beat the White Sox, 5-4.

1944
The White Sox beat the Yankees 10-4 to stop Hank Borowy's 2-year winning
streak at 11.

1945

with owner Breadon. Without Cooper, the Cards drop a pair to the Braves,
losing 5-4 in 14 innings, and 4-1.

1946
Pinch runner Jeff Cross steals home in the 10th inning to give St. Louis
a 9-8 win over Boston. A week ago the Braves won on an extra-inning steal
of home. The Cards win their 9th of 10 road games but will lose tomorrow.

1947
New York's Johnny Mize scores a run in his 16th straight game, helping his
team beat the Cubs 5-3. Mize, who will lead the NL in runs, eclipses the
NL mark of Max Carey and Fred Lindstrom. Ted Kluszewski will better the
league mark 7 years later.

The Dodgers beat the Pirates, 3-1, with Pee Wee Reese's 2-run homer the
big blow. Robinson is 2 for 4 with a stolen base.

1948

at the Stadium, the blast coming off Dick Rozek.

1953
After loading the bases against the Yankees in the top of the ninth inning,
the White Sox pinch hit southpaw pitcher Tommy Byrne for the right-handed
hitting third baseman Vern Stephens, who has ten career grand slams. The
unusual move pays off when the lefty pinch-hitter homers off Ewell Blackwell
to climax a 5-run 9th and give Chicago a 5-3 victory. Byrne now has two
career grand slams.

After the Braves' Billy Bruton's leadoff single in the first, Phillies P
Curt Simmons retires the next 27 batters to win, 3-0, at Milwaukee. The
loss snaps the Braves six-game win streak.

memorable when he hits a two-run homer off Jim Bouton in the fourth inning.

1966

record for most HRs (7) in 4 straight games (at least one in each). Washington

a 14-year-old fan, sitting with friends from the Poinsettia Playground in
the second row seats along the first base line, is struck by a foul ball
off the bat of Manny Mota. He initially reports feeling fine, but after
the game he becomes disoriented and starts walking in circles. He will be
hospitalized and die in four days. The parents will bring a lawsuit against
the team and the doctor, but it will be concluded in 1973 in favor of the
team. Fish's death is the only example of a fan at a ML game dying after
being struck by a ball or bat. According to the Hall of Fame, the other 4
incidents of fan's deaths are in the minors:  a 13-year-old Wenatchee, WA boy,
Jerry Highfill, killed by a batting practice line drive prior to a Northwest
League game in 1964; Leonard Handel, sports editor of the Anaheim Bulletin,
killed by a foul ball while watching a Connie Mack league game in 1965;
in 1906 in Spring Valley, IL, during a game between Peru and Spring Valley
a spectator, Patrick Cosgrove, was killed when the first baseman tumbled

the head; in 1928, fan Walter Lawson was killed by a ball thrown into the
stands by Art Shires of Waco. Shires had no intention of hurting anyone.

by Greg Luzinski off the Liberty Bell in CF at Veterans Stadium.

In the Reds 4-3 win over the Giants, Pete Rose knocks in the winning run on

accomplish this feat.

1983
In an 11-4 rout of the Pirates, Mets' rookie right fielder Darryl Strawberry

homers during his turbulent 17-year career with the Mets, Dodgers, Giants
and Yankees.

Despite 9th-inning pinch hit solo homeruns by Dave Engle and Bobby Mitchell
and 2-run shots by Gary Gaetti and Mickey Hatcher, the Twins lose 7-6 to

he joins Pirate Bill Salkeld (1945) as the only catcher this century to
hit his lone season triple in a cycle.

The Twins sell 51,863 tickets to their 8-7 loss to the Blue Jays, but only
6,346 fans show up for the game. The skewed numbers are the result of a
massive ticket buyout plan organized by Minneapolis businessman Harvey Mackay
to keep the Twins in Minnesota; if the club does not sell 2.41 million tickets
this season it can break its lease with the Metrodome. Taking advantage
of reduced prices on the Family Day promotion, Mackay pays $218,718 for
44,166 tickets.

his no-hitter when Lance Blankenship singles with 1 out in the 9th inning.

1995
The first printed reference to 'Manny Being Manny' is attributed to Mike
Hargrove by Newsday's Jon Heyman. In a feature entitled Baseball Homecoming,
the Indians skipper is quoted using the phrase to describe the behavior
his young outfielder, Manny Ramirez.

Just 10 days after the record for the highest-scoring day in NL history is
tied, 4 shutouts are tossed, by the Cubs, Mets, Padres and Pirates. It is
the 1st time this has happened since 1991.

1996
Sammy Sosa became the first Cub ever to hit two homers in one inning,
hitting them in the 8-run 7th inning at Wrigley. The slugger accomplishes

The Cubs roll over the Astros, 13-1, as rookie Amaury Telemaco, recalled
2 days ago from Iowa (AAA), allows just one hit in 7 shutout innings.

As Tony Phillips says, "It's not been a good 24 hours." The Sox' OF is
picked off base in the 9th inning of Chicago's 3-2 loss to Milwaukee, then
returns to the clubhouse to learn that battery charges have been pressed
against him by a fan. Phillips and the fan got into a shoving match after
the outfielder left yesterday's game in the 7th inning, changed into street
clothes and sought the fan. Phillips contends the fan was yelling racial
slurs during the game. Both Phillips and the fan will eventually be charged
with disorderly conduct and fined.

Albert Belle homers twice, his 15th and 16th of the year, to lead the Indians
to an 8-3 win over the Tigers. Jack McDowell (5-1) is the winner for the
division leading Indians, now 5 1/2 games ahead of the White Sox. Before
the game, the AL orders Belle to receive "immediate counseling" and do
community service as a result of his winging baseballs at a photographer
several weeks ago. Belle's agent replies that the star is already doing both.

1997
Trailing 11-2 after three innings, the Expos come back to beat the Giants

the Cards scoreless for 8 innings. The Braves finally push across a run
in the 13th on Andruw Jones' infield dribbler to beat Cardinals reliever
John Frascatore, 1-0. The teams combine for 33 strikeouts, three shy of
matching the NL record for an extra-inning game set by the Giants and Mets
in 23-innings in 1964.

1998
At Busch Stadium, Mark McGwire crushes a Livan Hernandez pitch for a 545-foot

an .857 slugging average and a .471 OBA.

2000
The Dodgers defeat the Cubs, 6-5, in a game at Wrigley Field. The contest
is held up for almost 10 minutes when a fan steals Chad Kreuter's hat
