May 6

1901
Christy Mathewson wins his fourth straight game, blanking Philadelphia,
4-0, on 5 hits. It is Matty's first career shutout.

1902
A circuit court in St. Louis rules that the NL reserve clause is unfairly
restrictive on 3 defectors who jumped to the Browns. The injunction brought
by the NL is denied, thus allowing Wallace, Harper and Heidrick to stay
as Browns. Inability to retrieve jumpers gives the NL a strong push to
reconcile differences with the AL.

1903
The White Stockings commit 12 errors, and the Tigers commit 6, for a
modern ML record by 2 teams in one game. Thirteen of the E's are by the
infielders, another AL mark. Sox shortstop Lee Tannehill leads the way with
4 errors, while 3rd sacker Frank Isbell and Patsy Flaherty check in with
3 apiece. Trailing 9-7 in the 9th inning, Chicago salvages a 10-9 victory
for Patsy Flaherty over Mal Eason.

The Pirates' Deacon Phillippe, enroute to 25 wins, lets one get away when
the Cubs score 9 runs on 9 hits in the top of the 9th for an 11-4 triumph
at Exposition Park. Dick Harley leads off the 9th with a single, the first
hit off Phillippe since the 2nd inning. Doc Casey drills a bases-loaded
single to make the score 6-4, and Evers follows with a two-run triple. The
scoring ends when Chance is forced at 2B. Jack Taylor is the winner, the
3rd time in 11 days he's beaten the Bucs.

1905
At the Polo Grounds, Boston's Irv "Little Cy" Young wins a duel with
Christy Mathewson, beating the Giants, 2-1. New York (13-4) keeps its hold
on first place.

1906
At Pittsburgh's Exposition Park, the Cubs top the Pirates, 5-1, for their
9th straight win. During the game the Pittsburgh ground crew uses a tarp
to cover the entire infield, the first time a ML team has done this. Fred
Clarke, the Pirates manager, will file for a patent on June 7 for a "diamond
cover," and the patent will be approved on February 2, 1911. Previously,
some clubowners protected only the pitcher's slab or the home plate area,
while others covered the bases as well. "One clubowner, George Tebeau of
Louisville, is said to have a circus tent with which he covers the whole
infield when it rains." (Chicago Tribune, September 30, 1906)

1910
The Giants score 3 runs in the 6th off Bill Foxen to beat the Phils,
3-2. Mathewson is the winner, allowing 9 hits.

1911
The Yankees top the Red Sox, 6-3, and turn their first ever triple play as
well. It happens in the 9th inning with Russ Ford on the mound when Bill
Carrigan lines into a game ending triple play.

The A's Eddie Collins hits the first homer at Washington DC's stadium,
but the Nationals prevail over Philadelphia, 7-6.

1913
Better organized and financed than other aspiring circuits, the Federal League
opens modestly and quietly, with clubs in Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh,
Indianapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City and Covington, Kentucky. No attempt is
made to sign established ML players. Cy Young manages Cleveland and Deacon
Phillippe manages Pittsburgh. After a 6-week season, the pennant winner
is Indianapolis.

1914
Pittfed's Ed Lennox collects the only Federal League cycle in a 10-4 win
over Kansas City. He adds a 2nd homerun, the first player to do that since
Tip O'Neill in 1887. The next to do it will be DiMaggio, in 1937.

1915
At the Polo Grounds, Red Sox rookie pitcher Babe Ruth collects three hits,
including his first homerun in the 3rd inning, but loses the game in the 13th,
4-3, as the Sox makes 4 errors behind him. Cy Pieh is the winner. Homer
number one, as well as homer number two, hit two weeks later, comes off
Yankees hurler Jack 'Crab' Warhop.

1917
No-hitters are thrown on consecutive days, as the Browns' Bob Groom
no-hits the White Sox 3-0 in the 2nd game of the doubleheader. The Sox
have just 23 official at-bats in 9 innings, a record. This year, Groom,
a Belleville, Illinois native, will be the losingest pitcher in the AL for
the 3rd time. He lost a record-setting 19 straight games as a rookie with
Washington in 1909. The Browns also win the first game 8-4 in 10 innings,
with Groom throwing the last 2 hitless innings. But Chicago will soon win
16 of 17 to overtake the sprinting Red Sox.

1918
Brooklyn's Dan Griner has a no-hitter with 2 outs in the 9th, but gives
up a hit to Phillie Gavvy Cravath. He nevertheless wins, 2-0. Griner had
a one-hitter in July 1914 which he lost.

At the Polo Grounds, Babe Ruth subs for the injured Dick Hoblitzel at first
base and bats 6th. It is the first time Ruth hits in any other spot besides
9th. He goes 2 for 4 with a homerun as the Sox lose 10-3. Ping Bodie has
5 RBIs as the Yankees sweep the 3-game series.

1919
The Dodgers overcome a 7 run deficit to beat the visiting Phillies, 11-9. Four
hits and 4 errors in the first give the Phils 6 runs and a Williams homer
in the 2nd is the extra point. Burleigh Grimes goes the distance for the win.

1920
Washington does all its scoring in the first 2 innings to beat the Yankees,
6-5. Joe Judge is 5 for 5 for the Nats.

1922
Cubs pitcher Vic Aldridge collects 5 hits and picks up the victory as
visiting Chicago tops the Pirates 11-7.

Carl Mays allows 2 hits - both to Bing Miller - and faces just 29 batters
as the Yankees beat the A's, 2-0. It is the submariner's 19th straight win
over Philadelphia and his 2nd in 2 weeks.

1925
Ty Cobb belts two more homers, off Dave Danforth and Chester Falk, giving
him five round trippers in 2 days, tying Cap Anson's 1884 feat. His 1st
inning single gives him 9 straight hits, and two other drives in the game
are barely caught. His 6 RBIs lead the Tigers to a 11-4 clawing of the
Browns at Sportsman's Park. Mickey Cochrane hits his 1st ML HR, off Sam Jones.

1926
The Reds use a ML record-tying 8 sacrifices in a 14-4 win over the visiting
Phillies.

1928
In the PCL, Oakland scores 2 runs in the 22nd inning to beat Sacramento, 7-6.

1929
The AL announces that it will discontinue the MVP award. The NL will abandon
it after this year; in 1931 the Baseball Writers Association will pick it
up and conduct the balloting from then on.

1930
The Yankees get Red Ruffing, loser of 47 games in the past 2 years and with
a lifetime 39-96 record, from the Red Sox for $50,000 and Cedric Durst.

The Cubs top the Dodgers, 3-1, with Sheriff Blake outgunning Dazzy Vance.

1933
The Reds sign Jack Quinn, 49. Quinn is the oldest to ever play for the
Reds. For Quinn, it is his 8th team, tying him with Jim Delahanty for most
teams played for, a record that will be topped.

Senators 2B Buddy Myer is carried off the field unconscious after being hit
by a Whit Wyatt pitch, as Washington tops Detroit 6-2. Earl Whitehill wins
despite giving up Hank Greenberg's first ML homer.

1934
The Red Sox score 12 runs in the 4th inning, helped along by a record-tying
4 consecutive triples hit by Carl Reynolds, Moose Solters, Rick Ferrell
and Bucky Walters, to beat Detroit 14-4. Firpo Marberry serves up all four
triples. In their next at-bats in the inning, the foursome tack on two
singles, a walk and a double.

1935
Boston's Fritz Ostermueller holds the Indians to six hits in winning,
2-1. The loss drop the Tribe to 2nd place behind the White Sox. Ostermueller
wins his own game with a run scoring single in the 7th off Oral Hildebrand.

1936
Jimmie Foxx hits his 7th and 8th homers of the season as Wes Ferrell beats
the St. Louis Browns, 9-6, to keep the Red Sox in first place.

1937
Dodgers and Giants fans attending afternoon ball games at both the Polo
Grounds and Ebbets Field are thrilled to have the opportunity to catch
a glimpse of the Hindenberg over New York nearing the end of its maiden
voyage of the season from Germany. A few hours later, the majestic German
zeppelin will explode on a landing strip in Lakehurst, N.J. killing 36 of
its passengers.

1938
OF Bob Seeds of the Newark Bears (IL) hits 4 HRs in 4 successive innings and
drives in 12 runs against Buffalo. Tomorrow he will slam 3 more. His 7 HRs
in the 2-day barrage account for 17 RBIs and 30 total bases. In his first
59 games, Seeds will clout 28 HRs and drive in 95 runs. His reward? The
Yanks decide he won't break into their lineup and will sell him to the
Giants for $40,000 on June 24th.

1940
Forget yesterday's mark. Two ML records are set as Pittsburgh uses 24 players
and both clubs use 40 as the Boston Bees win in 12 innings, 10-7. The Bucs
have lost 6 in a row.

1941
The Dodgers snag veteran 2B Billy Herman from the Cubs for OF Charlie
Gilbert, IF Johnny Hudson and $65,000. Herman, the premier 2B in the league,
is hitting just .194, but will replace the journeyman Pete Coscarart. In
his first game as a Dodger, Herman is 4 for 4 to lead Brooklyn to a 7-3
win over visiting Pittsburgh.

The newly renamed Braves beat the Cards, 5-4, to snap the Redbirds 10-game win
streak (12 on the road). All the runs come in the 5th and are unearned. It's
the Cards first loss away from St. Louis since losing in spring training
on March 29th. Since then they'd won 25 straight - exhibition and regular -
away from home.

Playing in his last game before induction into the Army tomorrow, Hank
Greenberg hits 2 HRs to lead Detroit to a 7-4 win over the Yankees. Each
time he teams with Bruce Campbell to go back-to-back, the 2nd time in his
career he's done it. Rudy York and he teamed up. A few days later OF Joe
Gallagher of the Dodgers is drafted. No other regular ML player will be
drafted during the season, but several others on training rosters will,
as contemporary writers phrase it, "join the colors."

1942
At Boston, White Sox vet Ted Lyons loses to Joe Dobson, 3-1, in 10
innings. Bobby Doerr is the difference for Boston, hitting homers in the
8th and 10th innings. The White Sox have given Lyons (1-3) just 2 runs in
his last 4 decisions.

1945
Boston's Boo Ferriss pitches his 2nd straight shutout, blanking the Yankees
5-0, matching a mark last accomplished by Johnny Marcum in 1933.

Tiger pitchers Hal Newhouser and Al Benton shut out the Browns in a
doubleheader. Prince Hal wins 3-0 and Benton follows with a 1-0 victory. Roy
Cullenbine hits a 9th inning HR in game 2 off Tex Shirley for the win. He
did it also last year while with the Indians.

Phils P Ken Raffensberger is inducted into the Navy, while Card C Walker
Cooper joined the Navy on May 1.

1946
Pinch runner Joffre Cross steals home in the 10th inning, giving the
first-place St. Louis Cardinals a 9-8 victory over the Boston Braves.

The Red Sox sweep two games from the Browns in a postponed twinbill, with
Boo Ferriss winning the opener, 7-5, behind Ted Williams' 3 RBIs. In the 8th
inning of the opener, with George Metkovich on first, Johnny Pesky grounds
out on a hit-and-run. He had hit safely 11 consecutive times, one shy of
Pinky Higgins ML record hitting streak. Manager Cronin said Pesky had called
the play on his own, and he would have had him hitting away. In the nitecap,
Williams scores the winning run in the 9th on Dom DiMaggio's RBI single,
and the Sox' Joe Dobson comes away with a 5-4 win. Dom will drive in a
record-tying 84 runs hitting in the leadoff spot (87 altogether). The Sox
have now won 11 in a row and are 3 games in front of the Yankees.

In Washington's 7-4 win, Cecil Travis gets his 6th straight hit over 2 games
before being stopped by Cleveland's Steve Gromek. A pre-war hitting star,
Travis has few other starring moments as a player after suffering frozen
feet in combat in Europe.

1947
Suspended manager Leo Durocher and his wife Lorraine Day are in the stands as
the Dodgers win, 7-6, over the Cards on a Pee Wee Reese HR. Robinson has two
singles. The Dodgers have now won 10 of 11 while the Cards have lost 10 of 11.

1949
In his second appearance, A's rookie Bobby Shantz is sensational tossing nine
hitless innings of relief in a 13-inning, 5-4, win over Detroit at Briggs
Field. The 23-year-old southpaw who made his major league debut five days
ago pitching 2/3 of an inning against Washington, gives up two hits and a
run in his tenth inning of work, but gets the victory because Wally Moses,
had a two-run homerun in the top of the frame.

1950
The Boston Braves hit 5 HRs in a 15-11 trouncing of the Reds. This gives
them a NL record 13 HRs in 3 consecutive games, breaking the Giants' mark of
12 set on July 1, 2 and 3 of 1947. Luis Olmo, Earl Torgeson, Bob Elliott,
Willard Marshall and Sid Gordon hit the five today. Hatton and Northey hit
consecutive HRs for the Reds.

1951
Pirate P Cliff Chambers throws a no-hitter at the Boston Braves in Boston,
winning 3-0. He walks 8 and throws one wild pitch but hangs on to record
only the second no-hit game in Pirate history. Chambers, hitting .429,
drives in Wally Westlake with the 3rd run in the 8th. The loser is George
Estock, a Braves reliever making his only ML start and the loss is his only
ML decision. For Chambers, it is his last win in a Pirates uniform before
he's traded to St. Louis.

The Reds and Giants split a pair at the Polo Grounds, with the Reds taking
the opener, 4-3, in 10 innings. Reds 2B Connie Ryan nabs Whitey Lockman
in the 10th with the hidden ball trick, the 2nd time in 2 years that he's
pulled it off against New York. The Giants take the nitecap, 8-5, behind
Dave Koslo's 1st win of the year.

Boom Boom Beck, 46-year-old coach for the Toledo Mud Hens, takes the mound
in game 1 of a twinbill against Minneapolis (AA) and wins 10-2. The victory
gives the former major leaguer an overall pro mark of 236-236.

1953
Alva Lee Holloman of the St. Louis Browns pitches a no-hitter in his first
ML start - his 5th appearance, only the 3rd rookie to do so, in a 6-0 win
over the A's Morris Martin. "Bobo" also drives home three runs on a pair
of singles, his only 2 ML hits. He will never pitch another complete game
and within 3 months will be out of the majors for good, the winner of just
3 games, the fewest by a no-hit pitcher.

The NY Giants tie the NL record for the fewest number of assists in a
9-inning game with just one, in an 8-5 win over Chicago. Al Corwin takes
the win over Bob Kelly.

1955
At Fenway, Mantle lines a first inning solo shot into the Yankee bullpen,
and Bob Turley shuts out Boston the rest of the way for a 6-0 New York
win. Frank Sullivan is the losing pitcher.

White Sox veteran Virgil Trucks shuts out his old team, Detroit, winning
1-0 over Ned Garver. It is Trucks' 10th 1-0 victory.

1956
Cincinnati sweeps the Phillies in a doubleheader at Crosley Field, 10-2 and
11-9. Reds outfielder Gus Bell takes reliever Bob Miller deep in both ends
of the doubleheader. Ted Kluszewski also homers in each game.

Led By Willie Mays' 4 stolen bases, the Giants edge the Cards, 5-4.

1958
Giant Mike McCormick, 19, shuts out Pittsburgh, 7-0, on 3 infield
singles. Orlando Cepeda's first-inning HR helps put the game away.

1960
The Dodgers send veteran OF Sandy Amaros to Detroit for 1B Gail Harris.

1961
In Cleveland, the Indians' Woodie Held loses a first inning grand slam when
rain washes out the game with the Washington Senators after two innings.

1962
Mickey Mantle hits HRs righthanded and lefthanded for the 9th time, in the
2nd game of a doubleheader, as the Yankees win 8-0 over the Senators at
the Stadium. His first homer follows a Maris round-tripper. The shutout
is Jim Bouton's first win in the majors. In the opener, a 4-2 Nats win,
Mantle accounts for both Yankee runs with a lefthanded homer.

At Cincinnati, the Cards salvage a nitecap win, 3-0, when Stan Musial blasts
a 3-run HR in the 9th off Drabowsky. Gibson is the winner. The Reds win the
opener, 5-4. Musial also sets a record for most games played, appearing in
his 2,786th and 2,787th.

Lee Thomas has 5 hits to lead a 19-hit attack by the Angels as they beat
the Orioles, 15-7, to sweep the 3-game series. Brooks Robinson hits a grand
slam to tie the game at 7-7 in the 5th.

The Mets acquire Vinegar Bend Mizell from the Pirates for Jim Marshall,
then send Don Zimmer to Cincinnati for P Bob Miller and infielder Cliff Cook.

1964
The Yanks hit 4 homeruns - two by Hector Lopez and one apiece by Mantle and
Maris - to back Jim Bouton's 9-2 win over the Senators in the first game
of a day-night doubleheader. Washington comes back from a 4-0 deficit to
win the nitecap, 5-4, despite a 3-run Mantle homer off starter Claude Osteen.

1966
With the score deadlocked at 3-3, the Pirates score 4 in the 11th, then
watch the Phillies come back with 5 runs to win 8-7. The 9 runs scored is
a ML record for the 11th inning.

1967
Washington's Darrell Knowles beats California, 2-0, with the winning margin
coming on homers by Bob Chance and Paul Casanova.

1968
In a 10-2 loss to Houston, Giants reliever Lindy McDaniel sets a NL record
with his 225th consecutive errorless game. The veteran hurler has handled
108 chances consecutively since June 16, 1964.

Baltimore's Dave Leonard shuts out the Tigers, 4-0, as Detroit manages just
23 at-bats in the 9-inning game. Jim Northrup's 2-out single in the 7th is
the only safety, but Leonard walks 7 and hits 2 batters. The O's pull of
3 double plays, 3 Tigers are caught stealing and one is caught in a rundown.

1971
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn signs ML baseball to a $72 million television
contract with NBC.

1972
Carmen Fanzone, playing for Ron Santo who is sidelined with a fractured
wrist, hits 2 homers and drives home 4 runs to lead the Cubs over the Astros,
6-4. Juan Pizarro wins in relief.

1974
Oakland P Paul Lindblad makes an errant throw in the first inning of a 6-3
loss to Baltimore. This ends Lindblad's ML-record streak of 385 consecutive
errorless games, dating back to August 27, 1966. Lee Smith will later top
Lindblad's mark in the NL.

1977
Angels P Nolan Ryan strikes out 15 in beating the Red Sox, 8-4.

1978
After going deep as a pinch hitter on May 2, Lee Lacy becomes the first
major leaguer to pinch-hit homeruns in consecutive at-bats. The Dodgers'
super sub will make it three in a row on May 17.

Red Sox rookie Jim Wright fires a 3-0 shutout over Chicago in his first
ML start.

In a 9-5 loss to Texas, Yankee 2B Willie Randolph pulls the hidden ball
trick on Texas Bump Wills in the first inning. In 1980, Randolph will have
it pulled on him (as noted by Bill Deane) and he joins Cepeda as the only
2 players known to pull off and have pulled on them the HBT.

1979
The Reds light up J.R. Richards and whip the Astros, 17-5. Champ Summers
has 5 RBIs for Cincy to win the opener. The Reds take the nitecap, 8-2.

1980
At Shea the Reds take a 7-0 lead in the 3rd inning, only to see the Mets
tie the game at 10-10. In the 14th Harry Spillman hits a 2-run double and
the Reds escape with a 12-10 victory.

1981
Maury Wills is fired as the manager of the Mariners and will be replaced by
Rene Lachemann. The former skipper, who reportedly is dealing with personal
issues, compiled a 6-18 record, making it the worst start in the team's
five-year history. In Lachemann's first game as manager, the Mariners maul
Milwaukee 12-1. The victory stops right-hander Mike Parrott's personal
18-game losing streak, one loss shy of the AL record.

Cleveland's Bert Blyleven holds Toronto hitless for 8 innings before Lloyd
Moseby doubles to lead off the 9th, and Blyleven settles for a 4-1 two-hitter.

1982
At the Kingdome, Gaylord Perry (3-2) becomes the 15th pitcher to win 300
career games, beating the Yankees 7-3. Perry gives up 9 hits and 6 walks
in beating Doyle Alexander, and is the first pitcher to reach the 300-win
plateau since Early Wynn in 1963. Perry allegedly wears a different uniform
each inning in order to sell them as memorabilia. The Yanks and Alexander
lose more than the game:  after giving up 5 runs in the 3rd, Alexander
enters the dugout and punches the wall, breaking a knuckle and sidelining
himself for 2 months. Perry, the 'Ancient Mariner', will end his 22-year
career with 314 victories.

1983
In a 4-2 California victory over Detroit at Tiger Stadium, Rod Carew,
with his 3 for 4 performance, raises his present batting average to .500
(48 for 96). The Angels' first baseman will finish the season at .339,
second best in the AL as Wade Boggs leads the league with a .361 average.

1984
Cal Ripken hits for the cycle in Baltimore's 6-1 win over Texas, completing
the feat with a solo homerun in the 9th inning.

1990
Cecil Fielder clubs 3 homeruns, and Chet Lemon a pair but the Tigers still
lose to the Blue Jays, 11-7. Toronto's Kelly Gruber hits 2 HRs to give
him 9 for the year, one behind Fielder. Ten homeruns are hit in the game,
one shy of the ML record.

Rickey Henderson hits a leadoff HR for the second game in a row and Curt
Young stifles the Red Sox on 2 hits in 8 innings. Oakland wins, 4-2. Henderson
pushes his leadoff HR record to 43.

Mariners 3B Edgar Martinez makes 4 errors in a 5-4 win over the Orioles,
tying the AL record last equaled by Mike Blowers just 3 days ago.

1991
Phillies OF Lenny Dykstra crashes his Mercedes into two trees while driving
home with Darren Daulton from teammate John Kruk's bachelor party. Dykstra,
who is charged with driving under the influence, suffers 3 broken ribs,
a broken collarbone and a broken cheekbone, and will be sidelined until
mid-July. Daulton's injuries are less severe.

1994
The Cubs' 10-1 victory over the Pirates ends Anthony Young's two-year 29-game
losing streak and snaps Chicago's record 14-game drought at home. The
hard-luck pitcher sets a major league record with 27 consecutive losses
while pitching for the Mets, 14 as a starter and 13 in relief. The Cubs
have 9 extra base hits today. Young will win his next 2 starts.

1995
In 7 NL games, the 14 teams score a total of 118 runs to tie a record as the
highest-scoring day in NL history. Seven of the teams score at least 10 runs,
led by the Dodgers who plate 17 in their 17-11 win over Colorado. Three pinch
hit homers (Mitch Webster, John Vanderwal and Mike Kingery) are struck in that
game, tying the NL & ML records, with 2 hit by Colorado, tying a ML record.

1997
Following today's 3-2 win over the Dodgers, Reds' manager Ray Knight
announces to the team that he's fining himself $250 for not knowing how
many outs there were when he called for a bunt.

1998
In one of the finest pitching efforts ever, Chicago Cub rookie righthander
Kerry Wood fans 20 Houston Astros in a 2-0 one-hit victory to tie the major
league mark for strikeouts in a 9-inning game. Making only his 5th big league
start, the 20-year-old ties the ML record held by Roger Clemens, who performed
the feat twice (Mariners - 1986 and Tigers - 1996). In addition to matching
the ML record the 20-year-old Texan breaks the National League record of
19 strikeouts in a nine-inning game shared by Steve Carlton, David Cone and
Tom Seaver. Wood does not walk a batter in his masterpiece, allowing only an
infield single to Ricky Gutierrez in the 3rd inning, that likely would have
been an error had it occurred late in the game. The 20-year-old Wood became
the 2nd pitcher in baseball history whose strikeout total matched his age
(Bob Feller struck out 17 when he was 17 years old). Wood struck out the
first 5 batters of the game and struck out 7 in a row between the 7th and 9th
innings, a streak that ties Jamie Moyer's Cubs record. Pitcher Shane Reynolds,
meanwhile, fans 10 and the two-team mark of 30 strikeouts is a NL record.

In a wild game, the Yankees (22-6) beat the Rangers, 15-13, after jumping
out to a 9-0 lead with 2 in the 1st and 7 in the 2nd. But the Rangers come
back with 7 in the 3rd. After the Yankees score 4 in the top of the 4th,
the Rangers score 3 to cut the lead to 13-10, then tie it with 3 in the
6th. Jorge Posada's RBI single gives the Yankees the lead in the 8th. Derek
Jeter has 4 hits, including a triple and homer, and 5 RBIs, while Paul
O'Neill contributes 3 hits, 2 runs, 2 RBI, a double and a HR. Juan Gonzalez
has 3 hits, 5 RBI, 3 runs and a HR for the Rangers. The game is a turning
point for David Wells. After Wells allows 7 runs on 7 hits in 2 2/3 innings,
he receives a tongue lashing from Joe Torre which proves therapeutic.

2000
The Yankees defeat the Orioles, 3-1, as Roger Clemens records his 250th
career victory. He is the 39th pitcher to reach the mark.

The Devil Rays defeat the Red Sox, 1-0, ending Pedro Martinez' 13-game
winning streak. Martinez strikes out 17 Devil Rays in a losing effort. Steve
Trachsel goes the distance to win for Tampa Bay.

In a Japanese League game at the Nagoya Dome against the Yokohama BayStars,
home-plate umpire Atsushi Kittaka calls a third strike on Dragons infielder
Kazuyoshi Tatsunami. Tatsunami contests the call, and his teammates rush from
the dugout, surrounding and wrestling the umpire. Kittaka's uniform is left
with spike marks and his ribs are fractured. Three years ago, ML ump Mike
DiMuro quit the Japanese Leagues after being pushed in the chest by a batter.

2001
The Phillies score 9 runs in the 2nd inning, then hold on to beat the Giants,
10-8. Pitcher Omar Daal has 2 hits in the big score, the first Phillies
pitcher to have 2 hits in a frame since Dennis Cook in 1990. In his next
start on May 12, Daal will go 3 for 3.

The Astros defeat the Expos, 13-7, as Julio Lugo gets 5 hits, including
a pair of doubles. Jeff Bagwell has 4 hits, including a grand slam, and 5
ribbies. Geoff Blum has 4 hits for the Expos.

At Camden Yards, the Yankees continue to beat up on the Orioles, winning 2-1,
behind Mike Mussina. Scott Brosius hits a solo HR in the 8th to break a 1-1
tie. The Yanks tie a ML record by starting the season 13-0 against below
.500 teams, matching a mark set by the 1902 Pirates and the 1966 Indians.

2003
Dmitri Young has 2 homers and 2 triples for 15 total bases in leading the
Tigers to a 7-6 win over the Orioles. His triple in the 9th drives home
the deciding run.

Jacque Jones is 5 for 5 with 2 homers in the Twins 7-3 victory over Tampa Bay.

2004
The Cubs pound the Diamondbacks, 11-3. Derek Lee gets 5 of Chicago's 15 hits,
including a HR, and drives in 5 runs.

2005
In a 6-5 win over the Cardinals, Trevor Hoffman becomes the third closer
in major league history to save 400 games. The Padres reliever joins Lee

is guilty of allowing most of the runs, giving up 8 runs, all earned, on 5

with a microphone in his hand, along with the inscription, "The Tigers'
broadcasting legend and masterful storyteller for 42 seasons."

runs in the 17-inning contest at Fenway Park.

A performance of the Havard baseball team lip-synching with choreographed
dance moves to Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen's hit song "Call

bringing national attention to the players of the Crimson squad.

After being deliberately drilled by a first-inning pitch thrown by Cole
Hamels, 19-year-old National rookie sensation Bryce Harper gets even by
swiping home plate when the Phillies' starter is too casual trying to
pickoff a runner on first base. The Philadelphia left-hander, who admits
his intention to hit the freshman right fielder, is suspended for five games
for the incident, and Washington's general manager Mike Rizzo is fined for
his incendiary comment when he labels Hamels as "gutless" for throwing at
his player.

The Pirates win the first instant-replay walk-off game in history when a
replay review reverses umpire Quinn Wolcott's out call of Starling Marte
