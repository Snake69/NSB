May 10

1903
Chicago takes two from the Cards, winning 6-3 and 13-8.

1904
The Cards beat up Christy Mathewson, scoring 5 runs and knocking him out
after the first inning. St. Louis continues the shelling to win 14-1. Matty,
now 4-2, will not lose to St. Louis in his next 24 decisions.

1905
John Lower of Waco (Texas League) tosses a 15 inning one-hitter, which
ends in a scoreless tie (as noted by Art Schott). The only hit comes in
the first inning.

1906
At Cleveland, the Americans drub the White Sox, 15-1, scoring 8 runs off
starter Ed Walsh.

1909
Organized baseball's longest no-hitter takes place in a Blue Grass League
contest between the Lexington Colts and the Winchester Hustlers. Fred Toney,
later to pitch in the only double no-hitter, throws a 17-inning no-hitter
for Winchester, winning 1-0. He fans 19 opponents and walks only one,
in beating Lexington's Baker, who allows 7 hits. A squeeze play ends the game.

The White Sox edge the Senators 1-0 in 11 innings, handing Walter Johnson
his 2nd straight 1-0 loss on his way to a 20th century record ten losses
by shutouts. For the Nationals, it is their 3rd straight 1-0 loss, tying
a mark set by the Browns two weeks ago.

Eddie Plank outpitches Rube Waddell to give the White Sox a 5-1 victory
over the Browns. The Browns also lose George Stone, the AL's leading hitter,
when he sprains his ankle sliding into 1B trying to beat out a grounder to
Collins. Stone will end up with a .256 average in this, his last season.

1910
Bill Purtell gets the dubious distinction of becoming the first player in
major league history to strike out two times in the same frame. During the
sixth inning of the White Sox 10-3 victory over Washington, the Chicago
third baseman is victimized twice by future Hall of Famer Walter Johnson.
The White Sox tally 7 runs in 5 innings against Johnson to coast to the
win. Johnson's record is now 2-5, and the Washington Post suggests that
the Nats "trade this phenom for a couple of good fielders."

The Cubs' Heinie Zimmerman makes 4 errors and 4 hits in a 9-5 win over the
Giants. Red Ames, in relief of Mathewson, is hammered for the loss.

The Phils pull off a triple steal in the first inning against the Reds
as Grant, Magee and Bransfield do the swiping. A short time later Magee
is tossed by umpire Brennan for protesting a call. Despite the thefts the
Phillies lose, 8-6.

1911
The Detroit Tigers lose their first home game of the year, 6-2, as New York
hands George Mullin his first loss. The Tigers have a 21-2 record and will
lead the pack until July 4th.

The Reds do all their scoring with homers in outlasting the Braves, 8-7,
in 15 innings. Dick Egan has his only homer of the year - a grand slam in
the 5th - and Beck, Hoblitzel and Tommy Clark all hit solo homers. The Reds
will hit only 21 homers all year, and Hoblitzel will hit 11 of them.

1912
At Washington, the White Sox finish a sweep of their series with the
Nationals with a 5-2 victory. Morrie Rath lines his first ML homer, good
for 2 runs in the 5th, off Bob Groom. Rath will total just 19 RBIs this
year in 157 games, to set a ML record for fewest RBIs. Groom is spared
serving up a HR to Collins when the new screen in right field prevents the
roundtripper. Collins gets a double. Cashion homers for Washington.

1913
The Yankees commit 8 errors, but still end up beating the Tigers, 10-9, in
10 innings. Yankees SS Claud Derrick commits three of the errors. He will
field just .872 for the year. In a deal that might be related to Derrick's
poor performance, the Yankees trade for sure-gloved SS Roger Peckinpaugh
ten days later.

Walter Johnson two-hits the White Sox to win, 1-0, and run his consecutive
scoreless innings pitched streak to 52 2/3.

1915
Despite a good move in the 2nd inning by the Cubs SS Bobby Fisher, Chicago
loses to Pittsburgh, 10-7. Fisher picks off Doug Baird with the hidden
ball trick.

1916
Led by Tris Speaker's 2 hits and three runs, Cleveland tops the Red Sox
and Babe Ruth, 6-2.

1917
Pete Alexander shuts out the Cards for a 1-0 Phils win.

1918
Pittsburgh's lefty Earl Hamilton is 6-0 with an 0.83 ERA after beating the
Giants, 4-2. He then enlists in the Navy. Hamilton was acquired before the
season after going 0-9 for the Browns last season.

The Red Sox snap their 6-game losing streak with a 4-1 win over the hapless
Browns. Babe Ruth, playing his first game in the OF, is 0 for 5 but plays
well patrolling "Duffy's Cliff" in left field.

Walter Johnson bests Cleveland's Jim Bagby, 1-0, the first of three straight
shutouts the Big Train will throw.

Chicago's Red Faber overcomes back-to-back homers by the A's Clarence Walker
and George Burns to beat the A's, 5-3.

1926
At Yankee Stadium, Gehrig and Ruth hit back-to-back homers off Tiger starter
Sam Gibson, and the Yankees outscore the Tigers, 13-9. Herb Pennock is
the winner.

1928
The Giants send OF George Harper to the Cards for C Bob O'Farrell. O'Farrell,
who managed the Birds in 1927, never regained his effectiveness behind the
plate after an arm injury. The trade makes room for 18-year-old Mel Ott to
take over the RF position, a spot he will hold for 18 years.

1929
The visiting Reds beat the Braves, 5-2, behind Red Lucas. Joe Stripp homers
for Cincy, which scores another 3 unearned runs on Maranville's 1st error
of the year. Boston's Lester Bell homers and teammate CF Earl Clark sets
2 NL records that will last the century:  most putouts in a game (12)
and most chances (13).

1930
The A's conquer the Indians, 6-4, at Philadelphia. Jimmie Foxx' 7th-inning
triple with two on breaks the tie.

1932
At Philadelphia, Lefty Grove shuts out the White Sox, 9-0. The A's will
beat St. Louis in the 11th as Foxx goes 7 for 9 in the 2 games. The combined
attendance for the 2 matches is 5,000.

1933
PCL star Frank Shellenback pitches Hollywood to a 12-3 win over Portland
and helps with a grand slam. Shellenback will hit 70 homers in his career.

1934
Lou Gehrig hits 2 HRs (one a grand slam) and a pair of doubles, tying the
record with four long hits, and drives in 7 runs, but leaves the game after
5 innings with a severe cold. The Yanks top the White Sox, 13-3. During
the game Ben Chapman shouts racial remarks at a Jewish fan. In 1947 he will
lead the dugout bigots in protest of Jackie Robinson.

1936
Joe Sullivan, Detroit pitcher, weakens after 12 innings of scoreless relief
and Cleveland edges Detroit 9-7. Sullivan takes over for Auker in the 2nd
and is splendid before losing in the 15th. Tribe second basemen makes a ML
record 14 putouts in the game (as noted by Trent McCotter and Lyle Spatz).

By beating the A's, 7-2, at home, the Yankees move into first place and
will remain there the rest of the season. Rookie Joe DiMaggio makes his
belated home debut and hits his first homerun, off George Turbeville. Lou
Gehrig has 4 hits and two RBIs and Johnny Murphy, in his first start of
the season, picks up the win.

In Washington, the Senators top the A's and Lefty Grove, 4-0. Grove had come
into the game having allowed just one earned run in his previous 48 innings.

1937
Monte Pearson pitches a one hitter in stopping the White Sox, 6-0. Joe
DiMaggio hits his 1st 2 homers of the year and George Selkirk his 5th for
NY. Chicago's only hit is a one-out first inning single by Larry Rosenthal,
who was erased on a DP.

Cleveland insures Bob Feller for $100,000 and flies him home to Iowa on a
private plane for his high school graduation. Feller pitched 6 innings on
April 24 before leaving with a sore arm. His next start is May 23 versus
the Yankees.

1939
Phillies' backstop Dave Coble catches a ball thrown from the top of
Philadelphia's City Hall. The rookie catcher handles the 521-foot dropped
ball cleanly, but likens the experience of a man jumping into his arms.

Bill Klem, behind the plate at the Reds game in Cincinnati, celebrates his
35th anniversary as a NL umpire. He then calls the 10-5 Reds loss to Brooklyn.

1942
Reds Ray Starr and Bucky Walters both pitch shutouts over the Cardinals. Starr
wins the opener, 1-0, allowing 9 hits, and Bucky coasts, 3-0, on a 4-hitter.

1944
Mel Harder wins his 200th career game as Cleveland defeats the Red Sox
5-4. He is the 50th to reach this mark.

Cardinal ace Mort Cooper picks up his first win of the season as the Cards
beat the Dodgers 4-2.

1946
Before a Friday Ladies' Day crowd at Yankee Stadium of 64,183, the first-place
Red Sox take their 15th straight game, a 5-4 win over the Yankees. Earl
Johnson gets the win with 4 innings of scoreless relief. A Joe DiMaggio
grand slam accounts for all the Bombers' scoring.

1947
At Cincinnati, Ewell Blackwell whips the Cubs, 5-1, to start a 16-game
winning streak. He won't lose until July 25.

Rookie Larry Jansen, who won 30 games in the PCL last year, makes his
debut as a starter and scatters 6 hits to give the Giants a 2-1 win over the
visiting Braves. Willard Marsdhall's 2-run HR off Red Barrett is the New York
scoring. Jansen will go 21-5 this year and lead the NL in winning percentage.

1949
Longtime Cardinal owner Sam Breadon dies. Robert Hannegan, the man to whom
he sold the club, will die October 6.

1950
The Reds trade veteran C Walker Cooper to the Braves for 2B Connie Ryan.

1951
The A's send veteran Sam Chapman to Cleveland for 2B Lou Klein and OF
Allie Clark.

1952
Hank Bauer of the Yankees goes 5 for 6 in an 18-3 romp over Boston. The
Bombers score 11 runs in the 7th inning. The BoSox come away with a
record-tying 10 assists in the 5th inning (Retrosheet records nine) as they
rack up 18 for the game. The 10 in one inning was last done on August 17,
1921.

Behind Spec Shea, Washington beats the A's 3-1. A's pitcher Morrie Martin,
11-4 last year, suffers a broken finger and won't appear in a game until
May 2, 1953.

1953
Pittsburgh IFs Eddie and Johnny O'Brien become the first twins to play
for the same team in the same game, when Johnny enters the nitecap of a
Giants game on defense and Eddie later pinch runs. But the Giants take the
twinbill, 4-0, behind Sal Maglie's 3-hitter, and 3-2. In game 2, Jim Hearn
comes within 2 outs of his 13th straight win over the Pirates, but falters
and Hiller wins in relief. Bobby Hofman's pinch HR in the 9th wins it.

Behind Billy Loes and Roy Campanella the Dodgers move into first place with
a 5-0 win over the Phillies. Loes tosses his only shutout of the year, while
Campy drives in all 5 runs with a double and homer. Campanella collects 44
RBIs in his first 30 games ... not until Tino Martinez in 1997, will anyone
else reach 40 in the first 30.

Vic Raschi makes his 1st relief appearance in 2 years, limiting the Red Sox to
3 hits in 4 innings, as the Yankees win, 7-4. Billy Goodman sustains a freak
rib accident, which will keep him out of action for 3 weeks, when Piersall
picks him up and lugs him from the field to break up Goody's argument with
umpire Duffy. Del Wilber hits his 2nd consecutive pinch homer in the 8th;
his first came on May 6th.

1955
Dodger ace Don Newcombe one-hits the Cubs 3-0. Gene Baker, who singles in
the 4th and is caught stealing, is the only base runner.

1956
At Yankee Stadium, Bob Lemon gives Cleveland a 7-2 win over the
Yankees. Mantle has a solo homer in the 6th for New York. For Mantle, it
is his 20th homer in May, a new record. The slugger adds a double and two
singles and is hitting .425 with 50 RBIs.

1957
Mayor George Christopher of San Francisco confers with Horace Stoneham on
a possible shift of the Giants franchise to the West Coast.

1959
The Phils Jim Hearn comes on in relief to pitch 1 1/3 innings against the
Pirates. He allows 2 earned runs before the game is suspended, with the
Pirates ahead 6-4. Hearn is released before the game is completed in July
and will be charged with the loss 2 months after his retirement.

In the first game of a doubleheader, Cubs reliever Elmer Singleton defeats
reliever Lindy McDaniel of the Cardinals, 10-9. In the nightcap, McDaniel
is the winner and Singleton the loser, 8-7.

The Yanks sweep two from the Senators at the Stadium, winning 6-3 and 3-2 in
10 innings. Mantle's homer in the 3rd inning of the opener starts the Yanks'
scoring as they beat Chuck Stobbs. Mantle singles and scores the winning
run in the 10th inning of the nitecap. Berra has a HR in the nitecap and
sets a new ML record for consecutive errorless games by a catcher with 148.

1960
Joe Ginsberg of the Orioles loses a struggle with Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckler,
and ties the record set 6 days earlier by teammate Gus Triandos with 3
passed balls in one inning. Dick Williams of the A's belts a grand slam,
as the AL record of 3 on one day in one league is tied for the 2nd time
in 16 days. Williams also doubles in a 9-run 5th inning. Kansas City beats
Baltimore 10-0.

Grand slams by Red Sox teammates Vic Wertz and Rip Repulski at Fenway Park
give Boston a 9-7 win over Chicago. The NL-vet Repulski's 8th-inning shot
off Don Ferrarese comes on his first AL at-bat.

1961
The Cardinals tie a ML record when 3 pinch hitters - Charlie James,
Don Taussig and Alex Grammas - strike out in the 9th inning against the
Reds. Cincinnati's Bill Henry pitches just the 9th to save the 3-2 win,
the Reds' 9th in a row.

The White Sox purchase Wes Covington from the Braves. Covington will play
for 4 teams in 1961 before settling in with solid years for the Phillies.

The Reds trade 2B Jim Baumer to the Tigers for 1B Dick Gernert.

Mike McCormick fires his 2nd 3-hit shutout of the year, stopping the Pirates,
3-0. The Giants are 3-up, 3-down in 8 of the 9 innings, but score 3 in the
5th, 2 on McCormick's single.

The Twins trade OF Ernie Oravetz and cash to the Dodgers for Joe Altobelli and
Ed Palmquist. The 5'4" Oravetz hit .262 in 1955-56 for the Senators. Oravetz
will see no more ML action, while the pair of Twins will only play briefly.

1962
Minnesota's Lenny Green and Vic Power hit back-to-back HRs off Cleveland's
Jim Perry to start the game, tying a ML record. Cleveland comes back to win
9-4. It'll be another nine years before two leadoff batters in the AL belt
homers, and it will be Perry teeing up those as well.

1965
At Fenway Park, the 9th place Yankees lose again, 3-2, when Yaz outhits a
hobbling Mickey Mantle. Yastrzemski hits a pair of homers and a sacrifice fly,
while Mantle is 3 for 4 with a homer. After Mantle doubles with two outs
in the 9th, starter Jim Lonborg is lifted and Dick Radatz gets the final

1966
The Tigers purchase P Johnny Podres from the Los Angeles Dodgers.

winner in the first game when Larvell Blanks hits a game-ending homer in
the 9th off Jim Slaton.

1981
Expos' hurler Charlie Lea no-hits the Giants, 4-0, becoming the first
French-born pitcher to accomplish the feat. The 24-year-old right-hander was

which opened for baseball in 1977. Lea walks 4 and strikes out 8 in this,
the 2nd game of a doubleheader.

1984
In the Giants' 4-2 loss at Pittsburgh, the Giants CF Chili Davis throws out

Fassero is the winner. Following Rodriguez' HR, the game is delayed when
fans in the LF bleachers shower the field with "Oh, Henry" candy bars.

The Red Sox edge the Blue Jays, 6-5, in 11 innings. John Valentin ties the
score with a 2-out homer in the 9th and Troy O'Leary homers in the 11th to
win it. Heathcliff Slocumb, Tom Gordon and Mike Stanton combine to strike
out 17 Jays.

For his second straight start, Braves' P John Smoltz is backed by 18 hits
and he coasts to his 7th straight win, 11-0 over the Phils. Javy Lopez

Hocking is caught stealing. The Twins fall to the Blue Jays, 6-4.

In San Francisco, the Cubs pull off the first triple play in the majors
this year, taking advantage of the infield-fly rule and the wind at San
Francisco to turn an odd one against the Giants. With 2 on, Stan Javier
lofts a fly into shallow center field and umpire Bob Davidson waits before
calling an infield fly rule. Three Cubs lunge for the ball before it bounces
off center fielder Brian McRae's glove and hits the ground for the first
out. Kirk Rueter tries for third, but McRae's throw beats him. Hamilton
tries for second, but 3B Jose Hernandez' throw to Ryne Sandberg nabs him
to complete the triple play. The Giants will win the game, however, 4-2.

hitting a grand slam and knocking in 6 runs in the Rangers, 11-5 win over
the Red Sox.

1999

independent, and therefore not governed by major league baseball.

The Red Sox pound the Mariners, 12-4, as SS Nomar Garciaparra leads the way
with 3 HRs, including 2 grand slams. Garciaparra drives home 10 of Boston's
runs as he clouts a bases loaded homer in the 1st, a 2-run shot in the 3rd
and another grand slam in the 8th. Nomar is the first Bosox since Rudy York,
in 1946, to slam 2 slams in a game and the second player to accomplish it
this year. He is the first American League player to drive in 10 runs in
a game since 1975.

2000

to begin serving an almost 6-year sentence for participating in a cocaine
and marijuana trafficking operation.

2001

for the rest of the season.

The Brewers defeat the Cubs, 11-1, as OF Jeromy Burnitz hits 3 HRs and
drives in 6 runs. Devon White adds a grand slam, while Sosa does the only

park, are just 3 games in back of Chicago in the NL Central.

streak. Brian Meadows goes 6 2/3 innings for the win over Colon. Sweeney
and Quinn each have 3 hits.

Fletcher go back-to-back for Oakland.

2002
The Angels score 8 runs in the 3rd inning on their way to a 19-0 rout of
the White Sox. The Halos join the 1923 Indians, 1939 Yankees and 1950 Red
Sox as the only teams to beat two opponents by 19 or more runs in the same
season. Earlier this year the Angels beat the Indians 21-2. The Anaheim
calcimine of Chicago is just the 11th since 1901 in which a team scored 19
or more runs while shutting out its opponent, and the first such shutout
in the AL since 1955 when Cleveland beat Boston, 19-0.

The Phillies' Vicente Padilla holds Arizona hitless until Chris Donnels
doubles with 2 outs in the 8th inning. He surrenders another hit in tossing
a 4-0 victory.

2003
The Cubs best the Cardinals, 3-2, in 10 innings on Alex Gonzalez'
walk-off HR. It is the 3rd extra-inning game-winning homer this month for
Gonzalez, tying the team's single-season record held by Ron Santo and Ernie
Banks. Gonzalez hit extra-inning homers on May 1 and May 4. The only other
player to hit 3 in one calendar month was Ron Gant, in 1995. Starter Kerry
Wood throws 141 pitches but the win goes to reliever Mike Remlinger.

The Cubs trade P Alan Benes to the Rangers for a player to be named later. The

the Diamondbacks, 12-8. Luis Gonzalez clouts 3 homers for Arizona.

2005

manager of the Royals. Bob Schaeffer, the team's bench coach, will try to
improve the worst record in the big leagues (8-25) when he becomes Kansas
City's interim skipper. Last year, with the Royals at 7-15, Pena vowed,
"We are going to win the Central." They finished last and this year had
dropped 16 of their last 19.

2006
The Marlins stop the Braves, 11-3, and also stop Edgar Renteria's 23-game
hitting streak from the start of the season. Renteria maintained his streak
despite missing nine games in April after straining his left rib cage in
the Braves' 12th game of the year. Miguel Cabrera has four hits for the
Fish including a homerun, and Joe Borchard drives in 4 runs, 3 on a 3-run
HR. Josh Johnson gets the win with 6 scoreless innings.

2008
With the Padres 3-2 victory over the Rockies at PETCO Park, Greg Maddux,

in major league history to reach the milestone.

Ben Sheets breaks Teddy Higuera's team record of 1,081 career strikeouts
in the Brewers' 5-3 loss to the Cardinals.

2010
The Tigers, to honor the request of the late Ernie Harwell, ask Jose
Feliciano to return to Detroit to perform the national anthem, 42 years
after many fans were upset by his original rendition at Tiger Stadium. The
Puerto Rico-born guitarist, who had been asked by the legendary broadcaster
to perform during the pre-game ceremony in 1968 prior to game 5 of the Fall
Classic, delivered a guitar-based, bluesy interpretation of the national
anthem that became very controversial.

2011
Bill Gallo, the creator of colorful characters such as General Von
Steingrabber, a caricature of the late George Steinbrenner and Basement
Bertha, who radiated good-humored optimism for the fans of the fledgling Mets,
dies from complications of pneumonia at the age of 88. The cartoonist's last
drawing, which was published in mid-April in the Daily News, his employer
for seven decades, featured Bertha window shopping with the hope of being
invited to the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine.

At Camden Yards, the Orioles start the game with back-to-back-to-back homeruns
when Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis give the team a 3-0 lead on
the first eight pitches thrown by Rangers starter Colby Lewis. The Birds'
trio of round-trippers to lead off the first inning marks the fourth time
in major league history the feat has been accomplished, but it is the first
occurrence in the American League.

2013
Tampa Bay starter Alex Cobb strikes out 13 San Diego hitters, but doesn't
make it out of the fourth inning in the Rays' 6-3 victory at the Trop. The
right-hander records 12 of his 14 outs with K's, including four in the third
frame, when a wild pitch on strike three allows the batter to reach first.

2015
On Mother's Day, 29-year-old Felix Hernandez becomes the fourth youngest
player to strike out 2,000 batters when he whiffs A's outfielder Sam Fuld
in the Mariner's 4-3 victory at Safeco Field. Only Walter Johnson, Bert
Blyleven and Sam McDowell have accomplished the feat at a younger age than
the Seattle right-hander known as King Felix.

2022
Reid Detmers of the Angels threw his first career no-hitter, and the
12th no-hitter in franchise history, by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays
12-0. He struck out two, throwing 68 strikes on 108 pitches. His only two
baserunners came via a walk in the sixth inning and a fielding error in
the seventh. Making his 11th career start, Detmers became the 25th rookie
and youngest Angels pitcher in history to throw a no-hitter.
