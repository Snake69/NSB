The Cubs overcome a 5-2 Giants lead to tie the game at 5-5, but a Johnny
Evers error in the 8th gives New York a 6-5 win. Mathewson, who pitches
just 2 1/3 innings is credited with the win, since he left the game with
the Giants ahead. Wiltse pitches the last 7 1/3 innings. By taking three
out of four in Chicago, the Giants increase their hold on first place.

1907
At the Polo Grounds, Boston pitcher Pat Flaherty clubs the first grand
slam by an NL pitcher when he connects in the 2nd inning off Hooks Wiltse
of the Giants. Boston wins, 7-5.

spanned five years starting in May of 1904.

Under new manager Roger Bresnahan, the Cardinals finally beat Christy
Mathewson after losing to the Giants' ace 24 consecutive times. Matty allows

Home Run Baker's 11 assists tie the AL record for 3B in an extra-inning game.

1924
At Salt Lake City, San Francisco (Pacific Coast League) outslugs the Bees,
30-14. The Seals outhit the Bees 37-17 with Paul Waner, Bert Ellison and
Joe Kelly recording 6 hits apiece. Three of Ellison's hits are homers and
he will have two more tomorrow. He will set PCL marks for homers in two
games (5), homers in three games (8), homers in a seven-game series (10)
and most hits in a seven-game series (25) going 25 for 37. Pete Kilduff
and Sam Agnew, with three doubles and two triples, each have 5 hits.

The Reds trade George Harper to the Phils for Curt Walker.

1928
In the first game of a doubleheader in Philadelphia, a ML record 13
future Hall of Famers take the field as the first-place Yankees take on
the 2nd-place A's. This number does not include non-playing Hall of Famers
Herb Pennock and Stan Coveleski, managers Miller Huggins and Connie Mack,
nor umpires Tom Connally and Bill McGowan. [HOFs: Combs, Durocher, Ruth,
Gehrig, Lazzeri and Hoyt for New York; Cobb, Speaker, Cochrane, Simmons,
Collins, Grove and Foxx for the A's] Led by Tony Lazzeri's three hits and
six RBIs, the Yanks edge the A's, 9-7, handing the defeat to Lefty Grove. The
A's win the nitecap, 5-2, behind rookie Ossie Orwell.

1929
Chicago's Ted Lyons and Detroit's George Uhle go 21 innings before the
Tigers get a run to win, 6-5, in the longest game - 3 hours 31 minutes -
ever seen to date at Comiskey Park. Uhle is the winner, tossing 20 innings,
with Vic Sorrell pitching the bottom of the 21st. Lyons, the loser, goes
the distance and gives up 24 hits. Charlie Gehringer drives in Johnson
with a sac fly for the final run. No pitcher has matched either Lyons'
or Uhle's marathon effort since. Les Mueller, in 1945, will come the closest.

1930
In New York, the Yanks and A's play their 3rd doubleheader in 4 days. Ruth
homers in both games giving him 8 in six games, and drives home 7 runs to
help New York sweep, 10-6 and 11-1. Newly acquired Red Ruffing is the easy
winner in the nitecap.

1935
After a day's delay because of rain, the Cincinnati Reds host the Philadelphia
Phillies in the first ML night game, winning 2-1 before a crowd of 24,422. On
the initiative of Larry MacPhail, FDR throws the switch at the White House to
turn on the lights. The Phils' Mike Chiozza is the first batter as the Reds'
Paul Derringer outduels Joe Bowan, though the Reds are outhit, 6 to 4. The
Reds will play 7 night games in all, one each against the other NL teams.

1936
Yankees 2B Tony Lazzeri sets several slugging marks with two grand slams, a
3rd HR, and a triple for 15 total bases in a 25-2 slaughter of the Athletics
at Shibe Park. Tony has now hit 7 HRs in 4 games and 6 in three games. He
also sets a new AL mark of 11 RBIs in one game, and is the first major
league player to hit two grand slams in one game. DiMaggio has three hits,
including a homer, and Frank Crosetti also goes deep as a league mark is
tied when 9 Yanks score two or more runs. Another ML record is tied when
Ben Chapman draws 5 walks as the Yanks are handed 16 bases on balls. Gehrig
exits early and is replaced by his favorite sub, Jack Saltzgaver. Monte
Pearson is the winner over George Turbeville in the laugher.

The Giants whip the Phillies, 13-5, as Sam Leslie goes 5 for 5 and hits
for the cycle for New York.

and 2 out (as noted by historian Bill Hickman). Without throwing a pitch,
he picks the runner off 1B. Selma, 4 runs down, scores 6 runs to give Toenes
the pitchless win.

1942
At Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, one of the most memorable games in Japanese
League history takes place, a 28-inning marathon (4-4 tie) between Nagoya
and Taiyo. It takes three hours and 47 minutes and both starters, Michio
Nishizawa of Nagoya and Jiro Noguchi of Taiyo, go all the way ... Nishizawa
311 pitches; Noguchi 344. Games are not allowed to end in a tie because
the league has to show off their fighting spirit, according to historian
Yoichi Nagata. Because this is the last day of the spring schedule in the
three-part season (spring, summer and fall), closing ceremonies and awards
are scheduled, so officials order the umpire to end the game. Nagoya uses
only 9 players, and Taiyo, 10. Despite the war, the game is noted in TSN.

1943
After his release from the Braves, Lefty Gomez signs with the Senators. He
will pitch in only one game, which he loses, then retire.

the ML lead in homers with Seerey of Cleveland and Schultz of the Dodgers.

1945
The visiting Giants beat the Reds 7-6 on a pinch homer by colorful Danny
Gardella. Gardella had started the day by leaving a suicide note in his
hotel room for his roommate Nat Reyes. When Reyes returned to the room a
few minutes later, he noticed the open window and read the note. Horrified,
he rushed to window only to see the grinning face of Gardella, who had been
hanging from the window ledge several stories over the street.

The Tigers lose Al Benton, who has 5 wins and 3 shutouts, when he is hit

A's score 4 in the 5th to win, 7-2.

1946
Ted Lyons, 45 years old, gives up the mound to replace Jimmie Dykes as
Chicago White Sox skipper. He is 1-4 but has an ERA of 2.32. The last 28
games he pitched, dating back to 1941, were complete.

1947
Matching the Chief's game yesterday, Spud Chandler gives the Yankees a 5-0
win over Boston, allowing 2 hits.

At Brooklyn, Carl Furillo pinch-hits for LF Gene Hermanski - in the 1st
inning - and clouts a 3-run homer to give the Brooks the lead over the
Phillies. Skeeter Newsome's 3rd career homer in 5 years ties the game in
the 8th and the Phils win it in 10 innings, 4-3. Freddy Schmidt wins over
Hugh Casey. Furillo's pinch homer sets a ML record - it is the only pinch
homerun to come in the first inning. As noted by Lyle Spatz, Phils manager
Ben Chapman starts righty Al Jurisch just to pitch to Brooklyn's first two
hitters ... Reese and Robinson. Lefty Oscar Judd, warming up from the start,
then comes in to pitch to the next three lefty hitters ... Reiser, Walker
and Hermanski. Reiser and Walker bat and then Furillo hits for Hermanski,
though he is not listed in the boxscore as a PH.

1949
Striking out the last 6 St. Paul batters, Maurice McDermott of Louisville
(American Association) fans a total of 20 for a new league record. McDermott

1950
Nat Clifton's Harlem Globetrotter contract is purchased by the New York Knicks

1951
Cleveland whips the Senators 16-0, with Bob Feller pitching a 2-hitter. Larry
Doby has a homer and 4 RBIs to lead the Tribe.

pitch. The 2nd time, in the 6th inning, he reaches 2B before Detroit C Joe
Ginsberg can retrieve the ball, and DiMaggio follows with a homer to deep
left field. New York wins, 11-1, behind Joe Ostrowski.

1952
Jimmy Piersall and New York's Billy Martin first exchange insults before
a game in Boston, then exchange punches in the tunnel under the stands. It
takes coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, along with starter Ellis Kinder,
to break the fight up. Piersall goes to the clubhouse to change his bloody
shirt and gets into another brawl with teammate Maury McDermott. He sits
as Ellis Kinder stops the Yanks, 5-2.

At Crosley Field, Reds catcher Andy Seminick drives in 6 runs with 2 homers,
one a grand slam, in an 11-5 win over St. Louis.

1953
A year and 3 days after scoring 15 runs in an inning, the Dodgers explode
again. Against the Phillies they score 12 runs in the 8th inning before
making an out. Their two bases-loaded triples in the 8th ties a ML record
for a game and sets it for an inning. The half inning takes 44 minutes to
play. The final score is 16-2.

1955
After losing 11 straight games, the Pirates rout the Dodgers 15-1, their
highest score in 172 games. Tomorrow they will sink to the cellar. Friend,
who pitches the last 4 1/3 innings in relief of starter Vern Law, is the
winner. Preston Ward has a single, triple and HR to pace the Corsairs.

1956
In Detroit, Mickey Mantle goes 5 for 5 with an intentional walk in the
Yankees' 11-5 victory over the Tigers. "The Commerce Comet's" offensive
output includes a homer and four singles. Mantle is hitting .421. The homer
is part of back-to-back homers with Joe Collins, off Duke Maas.

1957
In his first two ML at-bats, Cubs rookie Frank Ernaga hits a solo HR in the
2nd inning and follows with a run-scoring triple in the 4th, both against
Warren Spahn. The Cubs beat the Braves 5-1 at Wrigley Field. Ernaga is the
second NL rookie to debut with a triple and homer. He will add just one
more HR to his ML career total.

1958
The Tigers buy Bob "Hurricane" Hazle from the Braves. Hazle, hitting .170,
became expendable when Billy Bruton returned to action today. Bruton, who
last played on July 11, appeared in the 9th inning of the Braves 6-3 win
over the Cardinals.

The Detroit Tigers snap a nine-game losing streak and break the New York
Yankees' 10-game win streak with a 3-2 win behind Frank Lary. Lary is now
11-4 against the Bronx Bombers.

In Cincinnati, NL umpire Jocko Conlan criticized batting helmets, saying,
"In my opinion helmets are an inviting target for pitchers to throw at. Last
season at least seven helmets were cracked in our league by bean ball pitches,
intentional or not."

1962
The Tigers score their first 4 runs on homers, then score the winner on
a passed ball in the 11th to beat the Orioles, 5-4. Charlie Lau misses a
Wilhelm knuckler to allow McAuliffe to score. Bunning pitches the first
9 innings for Detroit and is accused by O's manager Billy Hitchcock of
notching the ball with his belt buckle.

1964
The major league mark for shutouts in one day is broken as seven of the
twenty major league teams do not cross home plate. The Twins, White Sox,
Yankees, Mets, Phillies, Cardinals and Pirates are all blanked.

Harmon Killebrew tags the longest homer ever hit in Baltimore's Memorial
Stadium. The Twins left fielder's 471-foot shot, which clears the hedge in
left center field, is hit off Milt Pappas in the eighth inning of the 7-6
loss to the Orioles.

Cubs speedster Lou Brock steals home for the first time, combining with Billy
Williams on a double steal in the 1st inning of game one at Cincinnati. But
the Reds sweep, 6-5 and 12-4.

Mantle hits his second homer, off Fred Newman, in two days to start the
scoring for New York. The Yanks top the Angels, 8-5.

1965
With the glare of the sun shining through the roof making fly balls difficult
to track during day games, the clear plastic panes of the Astrodome's
ceiling are painted at a cost of $20,000. The decision to cover the roof,
which reduces the ambient lighting by 40%, prevents the ballpark's natural
grass from growing and will lead to use of Astroturf next season.

1967
Tommy McCraw drives in eight runs, while hitting three homeruns, to help
the first-place White Sox beat the Twins, 14-1, in Minneapolis.

a homerun.

1969
Padres rookie 2B John Sipin debuts with a pair of triples, only the 4th
player to do so, in a 7-5 San Diego loss to the Cubs. They are the only
triples of his 68-game career. Sipin bangs his three-baggers in the 1st
and 4th innings, off Ken Holtzman.

1970
With the wind blowing out at Wrigely, the Pirates come from 4 runs down to
defeat the Cubs, 13-6. Willie Stargell has 3 homers and just misses a 4th
when his drive bounces off the bleacher railing for a double. Willie adds
a single for 15 total bases as he drives in 7 runs.

Cleveland's Tony Horton hits 3 HRs versus New York, but the Yankees win
anyway, 8-7 in 11 innings.

1971
In Philadelphia, the Reds' Gary Nolan loses a one hitter to the Phils,
2-1. The only hit is Denny Doyle's 2-run homer in the 2nd inning.

1972
At Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Don Rose homers on the first pitch
he sees in his first major league at-bat. The right-hander's third inning
round-tripper, which will be the last hit by an American League hurler for
thirty years, proves to be the difference in the Angels' 6-5 victory over
Oakland and Vida Blue (who is making his first appearance of the season for
Oakland after holding out) earning the 25-year-old his only victory in the
big leagues. This is also the only HR Rose will have.

1973
In a 19-inning marathon, LA outfielder Willie Davis collects six hits and NY
OF Rusty Staub five in a 7-3 loss to the Mets at Dodger Stadium. The two clubs
establish a National League mark by hitting into a combined nine double plays.

With the game scoreless in the 9th, the Cards put runners on 1B and 3B with
one out. Tim McCarver grounds to Cubs 1B Billy Williams who fires home to C
Lundstedt to snag Ted Simmons in a rundown. But as soon as Lundstedt throws to
3B Matt Alexander, Simmons races home to an uncovered plate. Cards win, 1-0.

1976
Bert Campaneris steals five bases, one shy of the major league mark, in
the A's 12-7 victory over the Twins at the Oakland Coliseum. The fleet

Phillies. Rader's 2-run triple ties the game in the 8th and Manny Trillo's
2-run HR in the 10th wins it.

In a Florida State League game, the Tampa Tarpons push 18 runs across
the plate in the 4th inning of a 20-2 win over Daytona Beach. The bizarre
frame, which lasts over an hour, features 9 hits, 6 walks, 3 errors, 3 wild
pitches, 2 passed balls and an obstruction call. Fifteen runs score before
the inning's first out is recorded.

1979

1982
Pittsburgh tops the Dodgers 9-3. Jay Johnstone breaks an 0 for 21 streak

Lamar Hoyt picks up his 14th straight win and runs his 1982 record to 9-0
by beating the Royals 3-1 in Chicago.

1984
Detroit (35-5) beats California 5-1 for its 17th consecutive win on the road,
breaking the AL record set by the 1912 Senators, and tying the ML mark set
by the 1916 Giants. Jack Morris (9-1) allows 4 hits in 9 innings to win,
and he is backed by homers from Lance Parrish and Alan Trammell. The Tigers
will finally lose tomorrow in Seattle, 7-3.

An hour after beating Baltimore 3-2, Oakland fires manager Steve Boros and
replaces him with coach Jackie Moore. Boros, who was criticized as being
"too nice," had led the A's to a 20-24 start, just 2 1/2 games off the pace
in the weak AL West.

1986
A "drunk" Billy Martin is "fired" as the co-host of Saturday Night Live by
executive producer Lorne Michaels after slurring his lines during a skit. In
retaliation, the oft-unemployed Yankee manager "sets fire" to his dressing
room at the end of the show, which is the season finale.

1989
Yankees reliever Lee Guetterman gives up 5 runs in the 9th inning of New
York's 11-4 loss to California, ending his consecutive scoreless inning streak
at 30 2/3. It is the longest season-opening streak in the majors since Harry
Brecheen's in 1948, and the longest season-opening streak ever by a reliever.

1991
In an open letter read on WFAN, a New York sports-talk radio station,
Gregg Jefferies, in response to the negative attention from Mets fans,
pleads his case to be treated fairly. The embattled infielder wants the
listeners to know, "I can only hope that one day those teammates who have
found it convenient to criticize me will realize that we are all in this
together. If only we can concentrate more on the games than complaining
and bickering and pointing fingers, we would all be better off."

1992
The Braves John Smoltz sets a franchise record by striking out 15 batters
in a 2-1 win over the Expos. He walks 2 in beating Gardner.

1993
Indians Tom Kramer, in his second start, faces only 28 batters when he

in a Class A Midwest League doubleheader.

1994
In a 13-6 Oriole win over Milwaukee at County Stadium, Cal Ripken hits his
300th career homerun. The milestone round-tripper is a three-run shot to
deep left field off Teddy Higuera in the third inning.

At home, the Cardinals set a new ML record for futility by stranding 16 base
runners in a shutout, a 4-0 loss to the Phils. The Cards collect 9 hits and
8 walks to strand runners in every inning but the first. At the end of 8
innings the game is scoreless, but new Cards reliever Mike Perez gives up 2
hits and a walk, then a 3-run homer to Pete Incaviglia. The old record of 15
baserunners in a shutout had been done 4 times, the last on May 12, 1975. The
Mariners in 1998 will match the Cards futility and set the AL record.

1995
Tossing a scoreless ninth inning in the A's 5-2 win over Baltimore, Dennis
Eckersley records his 300th career save. The Oakland right-hander becomes

history, taking 7 hours 39 minutes to complete the twinbill. Chicago wins
the opener, 10-8, while the Rangers take the nightcap, 13-6.

Seattle 3B Mike Blowers drives in 8 runs in the Mariners' 15-6 victory over

exchange for OF Henry Rodriguez and IF Jeff Treadway.

1996
In Seattle, Ken Griffey Jr sinks the Yankees with three homeruns, scoring
5 runs and driving in 6 as the Mariners win, 10-4. It is the first 3-homer
game for Griffey. Scott Kamienicki takes the loss, his last game with the
Yankees. His season will end in a month when he goes on the triple-A DL.

1998
In Florida State's 23-2 rout of Oklahoma in the NCAA Atlantic II Regionals,

2000
Sixteen Dodger players and three coaches are suspended by the commissioner's
office for going into the stands during the Wrigley Field scuffle with
fans on May 16. The suspensions totaling 60 games for players and 24
games for coaches is the harshest penalty ever handed down by major league
baseball. The 19 suspensions are believed to be the most ever stemming from
1 incident. All 19 individuals were also assessed fines.

Ahead by seven runs after five innings of play at Enron Field, the hometown
Astros find a way to lose to the Phillies, 9-7. Two days earlier, in
Milwaukee, with a 9-2 advantage in the bottom of the ninth inning, Houston
blew another seven-run lead in the eventual ten-inning 10-9 loss to the
Brewers at County Stadium. The Astros also lose CF Roger Cedeno today who
breaks 2 bones in his right hand and will miss 2 months.

The Giants defeat the Expos, 18-0, as pitcher Shawn Estes hits one grand
slam and narrowly misses another as he collects 5 RBIs. (Tony Cloninger is
the only major league pitcher to hit two slams in a game.) Estes throws
a 7-hitter, and is the first pitcher in 51 years (Monte Kennedy - 1949)
to hit a grand slam. The game is the Giants largest shutout win in modern
times breaking their previous record, 16-0, set on July 3, 1949, against the
Dodgers. The previous SF record was 14-0, against the Reds, on August 23,
1961. Their all-time record is a 24-0 win against the Buffalo Bisons, on
May 27, 1885. On the other side, the game was also the worst shutout loss
in Expos history, breaking the record of 16-0, set against the Cardinals,
on August 11, 1980.

going 5 for 6, with a double and 4 RBIs.

The Cardinals gaff the Marlins, 5-1, as Mark McGwire hits his 20th HR of

his 35th game, 6 fewer than Mickey Mantle in 1956 and McGwire himself in 1998.

The Angels defeat the Twins, 6-5, in 10 innings. 1B Mo Vaughn goes 5 for
5 for Anaheim, with 2 doubles and 2 RBIs.

2001
Cincinnati is finally shut out as Cub starter Jon Lieber one-hits the Reds
on 78 pitches, 3-0. 2B Juan Castro gets the Reds only hit. The span of 208
of games without being blanked establishes a new National League record,
with the 1931-33 Yankees (308) and the 1978-79 Milwaukee Brewers (212)
being the only teams with longer streaks.

Lana Blefary, the wife of former Oriole outfielder Curt Blefary, scatters
the ashes of her husband's remains at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Although
