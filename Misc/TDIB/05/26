May 26

1903
The first place Giants (22-9) top Chicago, 4-3, at the Polo Grounds,
scoring the winning run in the bottom of the 9th. Mathewson is the winner
over Jack Taylor.

1906
At St. Louis, George Browne drives in 2 runs in the top of the 9th to give
the Giants a 5-4 lead over the Cards. McGinnity pitches a scoreless 9th to
preserve the win for Christy Mathewson.

1907
Chicago's Ed Walsh hurls a rain-shortened 5-inning no-hitter against New
York. In a steady drizzle, New York is down 4-1 when Manager Clark Griffith
lifts starter Al Orth and inserts himself. Hoping to have the game washed out,
Griffith loads the bases and then serves a cripple to Walsh, who drives in 2
runs. The Sox figure two can play that game and, Billy Sullivan, who was on
first with a walk, loafs home from 3rd and is tagged out. Umpire Sheridan
threatens a forfeiture if the shenanigans continue. Chicago scores 2 more
in the 6th before rain washes out the game and the Sox win 8-1.

1908
Against the Reds, Brooklyn's Nap Rucker strikes out 12, but errors do him
in and he loses, 4-2.

1909
At Brooklyn, Cubs ace Orval Overall pitches a complete game and beats
George Bell, 2-0, to stretch his winning streak over Brooklyn to 11 straight
games. The streak began in 1906.

1910
The Pirates' Honus Wagner and John Miller narrowly escape death when their
car crashes into the safety gates of a railroad crossing in Carnegie, PA.

1911
In one of the few games in which both appear, Christy Mathewson and Grover
Cleveland Alexander are relievers in a 5-3 win for the Giants over the
Phillies. Matty takes over for Bugs Raymond in the 8th after the starter gives
up 2 quick runs. With runners on 1B and 3B, Mickey Doolan flies to Devlin
in right and his perfect strike to Chief Meyers is good for a DP. The Giant
score to give Matty the win over Bill Burns, though by today's standards,
it would be a save.

1913
The Phils use 3 pitchers in subduing the Superbas, 8-5. Grover Cleveland
Alexander, the middle of three, picks up the win.

1914
Red Sox righthander Rube Foster's string of 42 consecutive scoreless innings
is stopped by Cleveland in the 5th inning. The Naps prevail to win, 3-2.

At Chicago, the Giants come from behind to defeat the Cubs, 10-7. New York
is lead by a crew of pinchhitters:  Jim Thorpe with a 2-run double, Red
Murray with a sac fly, and in the 8th inning, Mike Donlin belts a 3-run homer.

1916
Despite outfielder Benny Kauff's base running blunders, the New York Giants
cruise to their 14th straight road win, 12-1, over Boston. Kauff, the Federal
League's "Ty Cobb", sets a NL record when he is picked off first base three
times, the only 20th century player to do this. Lefty Tyler does all three
pickings. Sailor Stroud is the winner, picking up his last ML victory.

Philley outfielder Gavvy Cravath's strike to the plate cuts down Brooklyn's
Casey Stengel for the last out in the 6th and saves Grover Cleveland
Alexander's 1-0 shutout win over Sherry Smith. The Phils move into first
place on the strength of Alex' 4th shutout of the month.

The Yankees stop the visiting Red Sox twice, winning 2-1 and 6-5, in
10 innings.

1917
Cardinal Walton Cruise becomes the first slugger to hit a ball out of Braves
field when he parks one in the "Jury Box", the 25-cent stands in right field
past the 402 foot mark. The Cards are victorious, 8-6. The next ball hit
out of the park will come in 1921, when Cruise does it again, this time as
a Brave.

At St. Louis, Red Sox starter Carl Mays is rocked for 4 runs and lasts
just one inning, giving way to Lore Bader, who gives up single runs in the
2nd and 3rd. That's good enough for a victory for Bader, as the Sox score
in each of the first five innings on their way to an 11-7 victory. Ernie
Shore stanches the scoring over the last six innings, allowing a single
Brown run in the 9th. Shore's save goes unnoticed for 50 years until ICI
research uncovers his efforts.

1918
In a Sunday game in Washington, the Senators and Tigers finish off a 2-2
16-inning tie that opened their series on May 24. Walter Johnson wins, 4-0,
allowing 4 hits in 9 innings and extending his scoreless inning streak to
40. The Big Train also has a single, triple and a walk in 3 plate appearances,
to raise his average to .323. The Red Sox will score in the 1st on Johnson
on May 29, snapping his streak.

1919
In a Memorial Day game in Philadelphia, the Red Sox takes a 2-0 lead over
the A's, but when Philadelphia scores 3 runs in the 2nd inning off big Bill
James, fans start pounding on the tin roof of the visitors' dugout. The din
is interrupted when Carl Mays emerges from the Sox dugout and fires a fast
ball into the crowd striking a fan named Bryan Hayes. After the game, won
6-4 by Boston, Hayes goes to the police who issue a warrant for the arrest
of Mays. The Sox leave town before the arrest can be made, but the warrant
will remain outstanding. Mays will be fined $100 by MLB for the incident.

1920
The Senators knock the Indians out of first place, winning 13-9. Tom Zachary
is the winner with Walter Johnson pitching four innings of relief. Joe Judge
has 5 singles in five at-bats for the Nats, his 2nd 5 for 5 day this month.

1922
In the nitecap at the Polo Grounds, Heinie Groh walks 5 times as New York
pounds the Braves, 10-2.

In Chicago, Sox OF Bibb Falk singles with one out in the 8th to break
Urban Shocker's bid for a perfect game. Ray Schalk's double ties the game,
and the Sox score an unearned run in the 10th to win, 2-1. Red Faber is
the winner over the Browns' Urban Shocker. The Sox win the 2nd game, 3-2,
scoring the winner again on an unearned run.

1925
In Chicago, Tiger outfielder Ty Cobb becomes the first player to collect
1,000 career extra-base hits when he doubles in Detroit's 8-1 win over the
White Sox. The 'Georgia Peach', who surpassed Honus Wagner's record of 993
earlier in the season, will finish his 24-year major league career with 1,139.

1926
The Yankees win their 16th game in a row, defeating the Red Sox 9-8 to
complete a 4-game sweep. The franchise record had been 15 straight wins,
set in 1906. The streak puts New York in front by 8 1/2 games.

1928
The A's make it easy for New York by making 7 errors as the Yankees win, 7-4.

1929
Two pinch hitters supply the holiday fireworks - Les Bell for the Braves
off Carl Hubbell and Pat Crawford for the Giants off Socks Seibold - hit
grand slams in New York's 15-8 victory. New York plates 9 runs in the 6th
inning to break a 2-2 tie.

St. Louis veteran Pete Alexander tosses a 5 hitter at the Reds and wins
5-2. Red Lucas takes the loss.

White Sox spitballer Red Faber turns back the Tigers, 2-0, on a
one-hitter. Gehringer's single in the 4th is the only safety. The Sox score
2 runs in the 1st without a hit

1930
The Indians take a pair from the White Sox winning 7-3 and 3-2 behind Wes
Ferrell and Clint Brown. Ferrell's mound opponent Red Faber holds the Tribe
hitless until 2 are out in the 5th, when 8 straight hits drive him from the
mound. In the nitecap, White Sox lefty Pat Caraway twice throws third-strike
seeds past Joe Sewell, an occurrence that Joe later blames on the white
shirts in the CF bleachers. It is the last time the Indians 3B will fan
this season, and he will end the year by striking out only 3 times in 353
at-bats. Once before, on May 13, 1923, Sewell was fanned twice in a game.

Washington wins a 10-7 slugfest with the Yankees as Goose Goslin and Joe
Judge of the Senators hit back-to-back HRs twice in the game. It is the
1st time it has been done this century but it will be repeated in 5 days.

1931
The Giants whitewash the Braves twice, beating Boston 6-0 and 3-0. Carl
Hubbell pitches the nitecap following lefty Bill Walker's win in the opener.

1932
Red Ruffing scatters 5 hits and Gehrig supplies the offense with a grand
slam homerun, and the Yankees whip the Senators, 5-0.

The Tigers and White Sox are tied 1-1 with one out in top of the 5th inning
of their nitecap game, halted by rain. This game is sometimes omitted in the
league stat compilations, even though the rule change prior to 1931 explicitly
counts 4 1/2 inning games as official. Detroit wins the opener 11-2, stealing
6 bases including a triple steal in the 3rd. Gee Walker has 3 of the 6 steals.

In Philadelphia, Boston and the Phils combine for 39 hits, including 4
homers, 2 triples and 11 doubles. The Phils outlast the Braves, 17-13,
to drop Boston into 2nd place behind the idle Cubs.

The Robins and Giants go 12 innings before Johnny Fredericks' single drives
in the winning run as Broooklyn wins, 3-2. Watty Clark is the winner over
Carl Hubbell, who strikes out 15. With the Robins winning 2-1 in the 5th
on homers by Lefty O'Doul and George Kelly, Brooklyn apparently plates
another run on Al Lopez' single. But an alert Joe McCarthy, who stayed
silent when Senor Lopez struck out twice previously, protests correctly
that Lopez batted out of turn, and the run does not count.

1933
Phillies OF Chuck Klein hits for the cycle for the 2nd time in his career,
but the Cards win 5-4 in 14 innings.

1934
Fans will vote for players in the 2nd All-Star Game, to be played on July
10 at the Polo Grounds. The managers will pick the lineups from 20 players
chosen.

After eleven days and eight appearances with the Pirates, a winded and
dry-mouthed Burleigh Grimes is sold to the Yankees. Pittsburgh acquired
the spitballer on the 15th from the Cardinals.

1935
In Cincinnati, Babe Ruth K's three times and makes an easy out in his 4th
at-bat on "Babe Ruth Day" as his Braves lose, 6-3, to the Reds. Syl Johnson
is the winning pitcher. Tomorrow, the Babe will walk as a pinch hitter in
the 9th as the Reds win, 9-5.

1936
In Boston's 5-4 win at Fenway over the Yankees, New York C Bill Dickey
suffers a contusion of the left kidney, which will send him to the hospital.

1937
Appearing as pinch hitters, Cleveland's Billy Sullivan and Bruce Campbell
both homer, marking the first time that two batters on the same team have hit
pinch round-trippers in an American League game. The off-the-bench homerun
heroics proves to be the difference when the Indians beat Philadelphia at
Shibe Park, 8-6. Harry Kelley serves up both homeruns.

Joe McCarthy of the Yankees and Bill Terry of the Giants are named to manage
the All-Star teams. Judge Landis announces that the managers, not the fans,
will pick the teams, and increases the squads from 21 to 23 players.

1939
With their 11th straight win, a 7-5 victory over St. Louis, Cincinnati
takes over first place and holds the lead for the rest of the season.

1940
The Reds receive their 1939 World Series rings from Commissioner Landis
and then beat the Cardinals, 1-0, on Paul Derringer's one-hitter. Stuart
Martin's 1st inning single is the only hit. In the stands are 21 fans who
saw the 1869 champion Reds in action.

1944
The Red Sox defeat the Browns, 4-2, in 11 innings, although Browns P Nels
Potter retires the first 23 batters he faces.

The 1943 Negro League World Champions, the Homestead Grays, defeat the Fore
River Shipyard team of the New England Industrial League, 1-0, in a game
played at Fenway Park.

1946
Two for 42 and hitting .048 for the season, Mel Ott stops playing and will
only manage the Giants.

The Red Sox turn stingy as Boo Ferriss holds the White Sox to one hit in
the opener of two. In the nitecap, Emmett O'Neill allows just two Chicago
hits. The three hits allowed in a double header equals the 1934 record set
by the Dean brothers, when Paul Dean tossed a no-hitter in game 2.

1947
The largest single-game crowd to this date, 74,747, sees the Yankees win
their 5th straight, defeating the Red Sox 9-3 at Yankee Stadium.

Eddie Lake's homer is the only score as the Tigers edge the Indians,
1-0. Stubby Overmire prevails over Black.

1948
Johnny Schmitz wins his 4th in a row as the Cubs beat Brooklyn, 4-1. Gil
Hodges hits a homer for the Dodgers.

1950
After a miserable 8-22 start, the last-place White Sox fire Jack Onslow,
replacing him with interim manager Red Corriden.

1951
The Dodgers use 12 different players in the number 9 slot, 7 of them Ps,
in losing to the Braves 12-10. In attendance is General Douglas MacArthur,
who was proposed as the new baseball commissioner last month by Reds prexy
Warren Giles.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks top the A's, 8-5, with Mantle belting a
bases-loaded triple off Dick Fowler that bounces off the bleacher railing
in CF.

hurls his 2nd consecutive no-hitter, beating Bluefield 4-0.

1954

Dodgers at Ebbets Field with an 8-6 win over Brooklyn.

The Senators collect three straight 2-out singles in the 9th and defeat
Yankee lefty Eddie Lopat for the first time in 3 years, 2-1. The Junkman
had won 12 straight over Washington.

Slugger Gus Zernial hits the last grand slam in the history of the
Philadelphia Athletics franchise, as the A's down the Red Sox 6-5.

1955
Dodgers P Don Newcombe becomes the only NL pitcher of the decade to steal home
when he hits a triple and swipes home in the 9th inning in Pittsburgh. Newk
has two RBIs as he wins 6-2 over Kline (2-6). Following Fred Hutchinson in
1947, he is the only pitcher to triple then swipe home.

Despite a single by Ted Williams in his first appearance of the season,
Boston loses to the Senators, 5-3. The Senators score 5 in the 6th when
McDermott starts the scoring with a HR.

1956
Three Redlegs pitchers - Johnny Klippstein, Hersh Freeman and Joe Black -
combine to no-hit the Braves for 9 2/3 innings. Klippstein walks 8 in 7
hitless innings before giving way to Freeman for one inning. Black walks two
in his stint and finally gives up a 2-out double to Jack Dittmer in the 10th
and 2 more hits in the 11th to lose, 2-1. Aaron's triple and 2 intentional
walks sets up a Frank Torre single. This is the 8th no-hitter to be lost in
extra innings, and the only combined-effort one. Starter Ray Crone doesn't
give up a run until 2 out in the 9th when Wally Post's RBI double provides
the Reds with their only run. Torre has 2 RBIs, including the winner.

1957
At Wrigley Field, rookie Dick Drott, 20, of the Cubs strikes out 15 Braves,
including Hank Aaron and Billy Bruton 3 times, enroute to a 7-5 victory in
game one. Drott's 15 K's is a Cubs 20th century mark for 9 innings (to be
broken by Kerry Wood) and one shy of John Clarkson's 1886 club mark. His
15 wins this year are the most for a Cub rookie since Pat Malone won 18 in
1928. Chicago sweeps, winning the nitecap, 5-4.

The Senators build a 6-0 lead over the Yankees and hold on to win 9-7. Mantle
hits his 2nd homer in two days at the Stadium.

Reds relief pitcher Hal Jeffcoat snaps a 6-6 tie with an 8th inning homer
to beat the Cards, 7-6. Jeffcoat reached the majors as an outfielder before
converting to the mound.

1958
Murry Dickson pitches brilliant relief for the A's and clouts his 3rd career
HR in the 10th, a game ending clout to beat the Orioles, 5-4. The veteran
pitches 6 2/3 innings of shutout ball.

1959
In another of Bill Veeck's stunts, 3-foot 7-inch Eddie Gaedel returns to a
major league field along with three other midgets. Arriving by helicopter
and dressed as Martians, the quartet shakes hands with Nellie Fox and Luis
Aparicio near second base on Comiskey Park's infield and gives them toy ray
guns as the PA announcer informs the crowd the ETs have arrived to help the
somewhat short keystone combo in their struggle with giant earthlings. Gaedel
reportedly says, "I don't want to be taken to your leader; I already know
him." Don Ferrarase then allows 4 hits to beat the Sox, 3-0. The pitcher
hits 3 doubles and drives in 2 runs to pace the attack.

In a singular performance, Harvey Haddix of the Pirates pitches a perfect
game against Milwaukee for 12 innings, only to lose in the 13th. Felix
Mantilla opens the last inning by reaching base on an error. A sacrifice and
an intentional walk to Hank Aaron brings up Joe Adcock, who hits one out of
the park in right-CF for an apparent 3-0 victory. Aaron pulls a "Merkle" by
leaving the field, and Adcock passes him on the basepaths. Both are called out
as Mantilla scores. Initially the score is 2-0 as Aaron returns and scores;
it is later called a 1-0 game. Lew Burdette goes all 13 innings for his 8th
win, scattering 12 hits. As a consequence of the baserunning in the 13th,
the Braves leave an NL-record one runner on base. Haddix' gem makes him the
9th pitcher to lose a no-hitter in extra innings. A combined effort of three
Reds pitchers, on May 26, 1956, was the last. Making Haddix' effort even more
remarkable is the fact that the Braves hitters knew what was coming. In 1993,
Bob Buhl admitted that the Braves pitchers were stealing the signs from
Smoky Burgess, who could not crouch down all the way. They would place a
towel on the bullpen fence in such a way to signal fastball or breaking ball.

In a trade that benefits the Yankees, New York sends pitchers Tom Sturdivant
and Johnny Kucks, SS Jerry Lumpe and that player to be named later to Kansas
City. The Yankees get P Ralph Terry, who has been ripening on the vine,
and Hector Lopez. Terry will win 73 games for NY and pitch in 5 straight
World Series.

San Francisco beats the Dodgers, 6-4, when Leon Wagner hits a 9th inning
pinch grand slam.

The Senators trade last year's Rookie of the Year, Albie Pearson, to Baltimore
for Lennie Green. Pearson, 5'3", bothered by a hernia, has lost his job to
rookie Bob Allison.

1962
In New York, Al Kaline suffers a broken right collarbone while making a
diving, game-saving catch off Elston Howard's bat to seal Detroit's 2-1 win
against the Yankees. He will be out until June 23rd. Hank Aguirre pitches
the Tigers to a 5th straight win, giving up a single run on Bill Skowren's HR.

Sandy Koufax strikes out 16 batters to lead the Dodgers to a 6-3 victory
over the Phillies. Dennis Bennett takes the loss.

The Reds manage just 2 hits off Cal Koonce, but beat the Cubs, 2-1. Frank
Robinson hits a 4th inning double to drive in both runs.

1963
Cleveland C John Romano suffers a fractured finger, which will keep him
out of the lineup for 5 weeks, and the Indians compound the fracture by
losing twice to the first-place Orioles, 10-6 and 6-1. Baltimore reliever
Wes Stock picks up both victories in the doubleheader with 5 innings of work.

1964
Washington's Jim King hits for the cycle against Boston pitcher Earl Wilson,
but it is not enough as the Red Sox win, 3-2.

In front of a meager crowd of 2,503 fans in Chicago, the Mets set 6 club
records in overwhelming the Cubs, 19-1. Coming off 20 straight scoreless
innings in Houston, the Mets jump on Bob Buhl, and 5 relief pitchers for
23 hits, including 17 singles. New York's 25-year-old first baseman, Dick
Smith, batting leadoff, becomes the first Met to notch 5 hits in a game
and every Met in the lineup has a hit and RBI. Jack Fisher is the easy winner.

Vernon Law and the Pirates subdue the Phillies, 13-4. Cookie Rojas has an
inside-the-park HR for Philadelphia and Johnny Callison hits one outside. But
Jim Pagliaroni has a grand slam for Pittsburgh.

The Indians complain that Whitey Ford is defacing the ball with his wedding
ring, which is wrapped in tape, and after he removes the ring, he exits
with one out in the 9th and the game tied at 2-2. Pete Mikkelson is the
victor when Bobby Richardson singles home the winner, 3-2. Richardson has
a pair of triples and Roger Maris hits a HR.

1966
The Giants' Juan Marichal pitches all 14 innings in a 1-0 win over
Philadelphia. Jim Bunning matches him for 11 innings before being
relieved. Marichal is 9-0.

1968
Los Angeles downs Houston, 5-0, behind Don Drysdale's 4th straight
shutout, tying the NL record. It's Drysdale's 5th win of the year - all
shutouts. Drysdale drives in the 1st run of the game with a single.

The Yankees sweep a pair from the White Sox, winning 5-1 behind Mel
Stottlemyre and 7-6, with Bill Monboquette the winner. In the opener, P
Gary Peters bats 6th, but goes 0 for 2, as the Sox manage just 4 hits. Tresh
and Cox hit HRs for the Yanks.

After a Jack Aker pitch hits Detroit's Jim Northrup on the batting helmet,
a 15-minute fight erupts in Oakland. Aker is injured in the brawl and leaves
the game, but Oakland wins in 10 innings, 7-6.

1969
Bill Rigney is fired as manager of the Angels, and coach Lefty Phillips is
named to succeed him.

1970
Tony Taylor cracks an inside-the-park homer in the 9th inning with 2 men
on to give the Phils a 3-2 win at Montreal. The batter before Taylor, pinch
hitter Byron Browne singled and was called out for passing baserunner Tommy
Hutton, who held up to see if RF Staub had trapped Browne's hit. Taylor gets
Browne off the hook with his drive, circling the bases after CF Phillips
crashes into the wall.

Claude Osteen earns the win and has 4 hits, including a HR, scores 4 runs
and knocks in 3 to lead the Dodgers to a 19-3 whooping of the Giants. Billy
Grabarkewitz scores 5 runs.

1971
The Padres Al "Iron Man" Santorini starts both ends of a doubleheader against
the Astros. Santorini, facing a lineup of 7 lefties, retires one batter
before manager Preston Gomez lifts him for lefty Roberts. It almost works,
but Houston scores a run in the 9th to win, 2-1. In the nightcap, Santorini
gives up 2 earned runs in 6 innings, but the Padres manage only one hit -
a 2-out single in the 7th by Brown - off Larry Dierker. The Astros win,
8-0. Santorini is the first pitcher since 1950 to start 2 games in one day.

The Yankees swap 27-year-old Curt Blefary to Oakland for pitchers Darrell
Osteen and Rob Gardner. Gardner had been traded to the A's by New York
last month.

over the Padres.

1976
In a scoreless game in Anaheim, Chicago's Ken Brett has a no-hitter with 2
out in the 9th when California's Jerry Remy tops a slow roller down the 3B
line. 3B Jorge Orta lets the ball roll and, in a controversial ruling, it
is scored a hit, though many thought it ought to be ruled an error. Brett
gives up a hit in the 10th to ex-Sox Bill Melton but wins the game 1-0 in
11 innings.

1977
Rickey Henderson of the Modesto A's (California League) steals 7 bases to

Silvio Martinez, making his last start for Springfield (American Association)
before joining the Cardinals, no-hits Omaha 4-0.

three times and twice knocking in 100 runs.

At Fenway Dwight Evans hits a pair of homers and Jim Rice hits his 16th to
lead Boston to a 6-3 win over Detroit. Bill Lee goes all the way for his
7th win, and his 91st as a Red Sox.

Tony Perez and Larry Parrish homer for Montreal and Dave Cash scores 5 runs
as the Expos pummel Pittsburgh, 15-1. They collect 20 hits to make it easy
for Dave May to pick up the win.

1986
Houston's Jim Deshaies records his first ML win, striking out 10 Cardinals
in 7 innings in the Astros' 4-1 victory.

1990

and batted .300 in 1992.

1997
In the Cubs' 2-1 win in Pittsburgh, Chicago's Sammy Sosa and Pittsburgh's
Tony Womack both hit inside-the-park homers in the sixth inning. It is
the first time two inside-the-park homers are hit in the same NL game
since Lou Brock and Hector Cruz of St. Louis did it against San Diego on
June 18, 1976. Greg Gagne of the Twins had two for Minnesota on October
4, 1986. Ranger teammates Bump Wills and Toby Harrah hit back-to-back
inside-the-park homeruns on consecutive pitches at Yankee Stadium in 1997.

At the Metrodome, Edgar Martinez and Jay Buhner both homer twice, and Joey
