May 13

1901
Bock Baker, just acquired from Cleveland, goes the first 6 innings for the
A's before concluding his short major league career (2 games) with another
loss. Two appearances, 2 losses. Eddie Plank makes his first ML appearance
and pitches the last 2 innings giving up 3 runs in the 14-5 loss at Baltimore.

In New York, Brooklyn and the Giants square off and at the end of 8 innings,
the Giants lead 7-6. Brooklyn loads the bases with 2 outs in the 9th and
Dahlen strokes a hard single resulting in a forceout of Daly at 2B. Brooklyn
then takes the field confident that 2 runs scored, but umpire O'Day answers
the crowd's questions by saying just "one." When the Brooklyn players
confront him and continue their argument, O'Day declares a forfeit, 9-0,
in the Giants' favor.

1902
The Reds roll over the visiting Phillies, 24-2, with each of the 9 players
in the lineup collecting at least 2 hits. Winning pitcher Bill Phillips
has 4 as Cincinnati totals 28 hits. It is the highest score in the ML this
year. Just 400 fans watch.

Chicago defeats Brooklyn, 2-0, though they make only one hit off Bill
Robinson. Miller's single in the 6th is part of a rally that includes a
walk and two errors. Jock Menefee, the winning pitcher, scores one of the
runs after he is safe on an error by Donovan. Chicago 3B Charlie Dexter
pulls off a hidden ball trick in the 7th inning on Bill Dahlen.

Arthur Hall, 23-year-old shortstop for St. Joseph (Western League) is struck
by lightning while leaving the field when the game is called on account of
rain. He is expected to recover.

1905
At New York, Dummy Taylor shuts out Chicago, 1-0, beating the Colts' Carl
Lundgren in the first of three straight collars by Giants pitchers.

1906
The Reds sell pitcher Gus Dorner (1-1) to the Boston Beaneaters, where
he will go 8-25 to join three other 20-game losers, tying last year's ML
record by Boston.

1908
At Pittsburgh, the Pirates knock out Christy Mathewson in the 5th inning
and top the Giants, 5-1, behind Howie Comnitz. It is Matty's first loss of
the year. The game takes just 85 minutes to complete.

1909
New York ace Christy Mathewson tosses a 4-hitter to beat the Cubs' Ruby
Kroh, 4-1.

The Red Sox jump on former teammate Cy Young for 17 hits - 4 by Harry Hooper
- in an 8-1 win over Cleveland. Cleveland 3B Bill Bradley makes 7 put outs,
tying his own team mark set in 1901.

1910
The Cubs trade OF Doc Miller to Boston (NL) for righty Lew Richie.

1911
At Hilltop Park, Fred Merkle has 6 RBIs in one inning - on a double and an
inside-the-park homerun - as the Giants tee off on three St. Louis pitchers
for 13 runs in the first inning, including 7 before an out is recorded. Merkle
adds a 3-run double in the inning and then scores the last run on the front
end of a successful double steal. The spree ties a first inning ML record
enjoyed by the Boston Beaneaters against the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900,
and it remains a Giants club record through the 20th century. John McGraw
decides to save starter Mathewson for another day and lifts him after one
inning, but the official scorer credits Matty with the win. McGraw wants
to give Marquard some experience in pitching without pressure and brings
in Rube to finish. He works the last 8 innings and strikes out 14, setting
a 20th century NL record, and a since broken ML record, for strikeouts by
a reliever ... Walter Johnson will K 15 batters in 1913 and Randy Johnson
will match it in 2001, while Denny McLain will rack up 14 in 1965. The
Giants roll, 19-5, pinning the loss on Harry Sallee.

At Philadelphia, Grover Alexander relieves George Chalmers with the score
1-1 in the 9th and shuts out the Reds for 8 innings. Pete gives up no hits
while striking out 8. The Phils finally score in the 16th to win it.

Paced by Ty Cobb's 3rd inning grand slam, his first ever, the Tigers take a
10-1 lead over the Red Sox after 5 innings. But Boston ties it in the 9th
on Duffy Lewis' grand slam, and wins it in the 10th inning, 13-11. Boston
outhits Detroit, 20-14.

1912
Hippo Vaughn and the Yankees stop the host Tigers, 15-4. The Tigers score
in the first inning when Ty Cobb swipes home.

A Western Union telegraph operator named Lou Proctor inserts his name as a
pinch hitter into the Browns-Red Sox boxscore (a walk in his at-bat). TSN
will publish the boxscore and, years later, Proctor's name will appear in
the first edition of The Baseball Encyclopedia.

1913
Tom Seaton, with relief help from Alexander, tops the Pirates, 5-4. The
winning blow for the Phils is a solo homer by Sherry Magee.

1915
In Chicago, when the Cubs take a 5-1 lead over the Pittsburgh Pirates
after 3 1/2 innings the Bucs start stalling with two out (as noted by
Retrosheet). When P George Pearce comes to the plate, Pitt hurler Guy
Cooper tosses his pitches so high his catcher can barely reach them. After
several pitches, manager Roger Bresnahan signals Pierce to swing at anything,
which he does. Pirate manager Fred Clarke comes out to argue and the umpire
ejects him. Cooper subsequently fires a beanball at Pearce, who dodges the
pitch and throws his bat at the pitcher. The ump calls ball four and ejects
Pearce. Pitcher Hippo Vaughn enters the game as a pinch runner for Pearce
and steals 2B and 3B and finally makes the 3rd out when he attempts slowly to
steal home. Pirates outfielder Dan Costello is ejected for indulging dilatory
tactics despite the fact he isn't even in the game. Play is finally called
with one out in the home 5th after the umpires wait the customary 30 minutes.

1918
The Phils' Joe Oeschger pitches 9 no-hit innings, but they come after the
Cards put together 2 hits and a walk for 3 runs in the first inning of a
10-inning 3-3 tie.

1921
A jury deliberates less than a hour and acquits Benny Kauff of the auto theft
and related charges against him. Despite the acquittal, Landis maintains his
disbarment of the FL batting champ. Kauff goes to court for reinstatement,
but on January 17, 1922, it will be denied.

1923
In a 5-2 Cleveland win, Washington rookie Wally Warmoth strikes out Cleveland
SS Joe Sewell twice. It is the first of only 2 times in his 14-year career
that Sewell will fan multiple times in the same contest (the other time
Sewell struck out twice, also).

Chicago's Pete Alexander beat Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance, 5-2. For Alexander,
it is his 6th straight game without walking a batter since the season's
start. He'll walk 3 in his next outing, ending his streak at 52 straight
innings.

Playing for Salt Lake City (PCL), teammates Oscar Vitt and Paul Strand each
connect for 2 homers in the same inning.

1924
Pitching for the Reds, Carl Mays picks up his first win, 4-3 over the
Phillies. The submariner will have a 13-0 streak against the Phillies,
never losing.

1927
With a bunt in the 3rd inning, Ty Cobb stretches his hit streak to 14
games as the A's pound the Tigers, 10-3. Howard Ehmke holds Detroit to 6
hits. Eddie Collins is 1 for 2 with 4 walks, and Al Simmons has a homer,
double and single for the A's.

1928
The Reds move briefly into first place in the NL with an 11-4 win over the
Phils. Carl Mays is the winner, allowing 11 hits.

1929
In Cleveland, fans have no trouble telling the players apart, as both
teams wear numbers on their uniform backs. This is a first in the majors.
The numerals will become a permanent fixture on each club's attire.
The Indians beat the Yanks 4-3, despite a homer by New York's Mark Koenig
off Willis Hudlin in the 6th inning. Also in the 6th, Yankee catcher Bill
Dickey records three assists. For New York, it is their 3rd loss after 6
straight wins.

1931
The A's Jimmy Dykes swipes home in the top of the 11th against the White
Sox as the A's win, 7-5, over reliever Red Faber.

1934
For the second time in his career, Cleveland's Lloyd Brown serves up a grand
slam to Lou Gehrig, as the Yanks roll, 8-0, behind Lefty Gomez. Ben Chapman
adds a homer and a pair of triples to lead New York. Babe Ruth leaves in
the 4th inning when he is hit on the knee cap by a pitch from Thornton Lee.

The Red Sox use a pair of grand slams - by Walters and Morgan - to roll
over Chicago, 14-2. Walters adds a 2-run homer for 6 ribbies.

1937
At Chicago, Washington's Joe Kuhel ties the modern ML record with 3 triples
as the Nats win, 10-2. Kuhel adds a single to drive in 3 runs.

Detroit's George Gill makes his first ML start and shuts out the Red Sox,
4-0. Gill allows five hits, three by Joe Cronin, as Detroit replaces the
Red Sox in 3rd place. Wes Ferrell allows just five hits, including a double
and homer by Charlie Gehringer.

Joe DiMaggio replaces Lou Gehrig as the Yankees cleanup hitter and drives
in three runs, as the Yankees trip the Browns, 4-2. Gehrig, hitting 5th
gets a double after going hitless in his last 21 at-bats. Tommy Henrich,
making his 2nd appearance, bats third. He collects a pair of singles. Winning
pitcher Lefty Gomez is the only Yankee without a hit.

Carl Hubbell wins his 5th straight, and 21st over 2 seasons, stopping the
NL-leading Pirates, 5-2. Arky Vaughan's two homers account for all the
Pittsburgh scoring. Leading off, Dick Bartell hits his 4th homer in five
days to continue his 12-game hitting streak, as the Giants hand reliever
Waite Hoyt the loss.

1939
In a 10-player deal, Bobo Newsom goes from the St. Louis Browns, along
with Beau Bell, Red Kress and Jim Walkup, to Detroit for Vern Kennedy,
Bob Harris, George Gill, Roxie Lawson, Chet Laabs and Mark Christman. It
is one of the biggest trades of the 1930s. Newsom will rack up 17 wins
this year as a Tiger to finish at 20-11. Stephens will be the reverse,
finishing at 9-20, while Gill, 0-1 after two fine seasons with the Tigers,
will be 1-12 with the Browns.

1940
In a replay of their washed-out game of April 23rd called on account of
darkness, the Reds and the Cards neglect to inform the league office,
and no umpires are assigned to Crosley Field. Coach Jimmy Wilson and P Lon
Warneke are pressed into service as umpires before umpire Larry Goetz, at
home in Cincinnati on a day off, arrives to officiate. Warneke will later
become a full-time umpire, while Wilson will return to active duty at the
end of the year and star in the WS. Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals
hits 3 HRs, and the Reds' Bill Werber has 5 hits and collects 4 consecutive
doubles in a 14-inning 8-8 tie with the Reds. Werber is the only one to do
it in both leagues. Mize's is his 3rd 3-homer game, breaking the tie for
the NL record he shared with George Kelly. After 1910, there will be only
5 games this century in which active players umpire. Besides today these
are:  1912, Ham Hyatt (Pit-N) and Ed Phelps (Bro-N); 1935, Jocko Conlan
(Chi-A); 1941, Johnny Cooney (Bos-N) and Freddie Fitzsimmons (Bro-N);
and 1978, Don Leppert (coach, Tor-A) and Jerry Zimmerman (coach, Min-A)
(as noted by historian Wayne McElreavy).

Bees reliever Jim Callahan walks seven, including 5 straight Giant batters
after 2 are out in the 4th. He throws 18 straight balls in the inning,
though the Giants just score 2. Gumbert is the winner in relief, 11-5.

1942
Pitcher Jim Tobin of the Boston Braves slams 3 successive HRs - two off
Jake Mooty and one off Hi Bithorn - to beat the Chicago Cubs, 6-5, at Braves
Field, the only modern-day ML pitcher ever to hit 3 straight in a game. Tobin
is the only 20th century pitcher to hit 3 in a game (Guy Hecker hit three
inside-the-park round-trippers playing for Louisville in 1886). Tobin's last,
in the 8th, breaks a 4-4 tie. Bithorn takes the loss. Bill Nicholson returns
the compliment, clouting a 2-run homer off Tobin in the 6th inning. Tobin
('Ironsides'), who pinch-hit a homer in the eighth inning of yesterday's
contest, would have hit five consecutive blasts, if his first inning fly
ball, which was caught against the right field fence, had gone out.

1944
Joe Page, just called up from Newark, throws a 5-hitter, as the Yankees
defeat the Indians 5-1.

1945
Rookie phenom Boo Ferriss reaches 22 shutout innings before allowing a run
versus the Tigers in an 8-2 Red Sox win. This sets an AL record for scoreless
innings at the start of a ML career. Ferriss strikes out 1B Rudy York 4 times,
all on called 3rd strikes. Detroit earns a split with a 2-0 win in game 2,
behind Al Benton's pitching. Benton has now allowed one earned run in his
last 45 innings.

The Yankees' Atley Donald is victorious over the Indians, 1-0, in 10 innings
when New York breaks through against pitcher Red Embree. A walk, a bunt
single, a sac bunt and a sac fly by Denny plates the run. Atley is 13-1
against the Tribe, with his only loss coming on August 21, 1941 when Feller
won, 2-0. Cleveland wins the second game, 4-2, behind Steve Gromek's 7-hitter.

1946
The Yankees become the first ML team to fly on a regular basis, as they
fly United to St. Louis aboard the Yankee Mainliner. Red Ruffing and four
others choose to take the train.

1947
During the pre-game infield practice, a barrage of racial slurs are directed
at Jackie Robinson by the Cincinnati fans during the Dodgers' first visit to
Crosley Field this season. Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese, a Southerner
from Kentucky with friends attending the game and the captain of the team,
engages the black infielder in conversation, and then put his arm around
his teammate's shoulder, a gesture that stuns and silences the crowd. 27,164
fans watch the Reds beat the Dodgers, 7-5. It is estimated that nearly 9,000
of the fans are black, attracted to the game because of Robinson. As fans
head for the exits after the game, the organist plays "Bye, Bye, Blackbird".

Ted Williams hits 2 HRs to LF, the first to that pasture in his career at
Fenway Park, as the Red Sox wallop the White Sox 19-6. Earlier in the day,
Williams had promised a boy in the Malden hospital that he would hit a homer
for him. Bobby Doerr cycles for the 2nd time in his career, the first Sox
to do that, and has a double and single in the 9-run 8th to complete his
cycle. Bill Zuber is the winner over Earl Harrist.

The Yankees pound the Browns, 9-1, with Charlie Keller, DiMaggio and Johnny
Lindell combining for consecutive homers off starter Fred Sanford in the
6th inning.

1950
The Red Sox release Piper Davis, their first black minor leaguer. Davis
hit .378 last season with the Birmingham Black Barons and was the leading
hitter on the Scranton (Eastern L) team when the Sox released him.

1951
At Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Mantle hits his first righty homer, off Alex
Kellner, in the majors, then makes the last out by popping up his bunt
attempt with the tying run on 3rd. The A's win 5-4, then win the nitecap as
well. Mantle has no homers in the 2nd game loss, but misses 2nd base on a hit.

The Dodgers spot the Braves 6 runs, then roar back to win, 12-6 and take
over the NL lead. Erv Palica gives up just two hits over the last 7 innings
for his first win. Brooklyn scores five runs off Max Surkont in the 3rd and
4th innings, and Carl Furillo adds a three-run homer in the 5th off Dave Cole.

At Ft. Worth, ex-Dodger Rex Barney walks 16 Houston batters in 7 2/3 innings
to set a Texas League record. Barney faces 41 batters and is behind on all but
7 off them, and adds 2 wild pitches. He leaves with a 2-1 score after walking
across a run in the 8th, and ends up losing 6-2 to Vinegar Bend Mizell.

1952
In a Class D Appalachian League game, Bristol (Virginia) pitcher Ron Necciai
strikes out twenty-seven batters when he no-hits Welch (West Virginia)
to win 7-0. The catcher missed a third strike allowing one batter to reach
base to ruin the perfect-perfect bid. In Necciai's next start he will strike
out 24 while giving up 2 hits. He will later compile a career 1-6 mark with
the Pirates.

In his first ML start since returning from 19 months in the army, the Phils'
Curt Simmons allows just 2 hits while fanning 12 to beat the Cubs, 2-0. Joe
Hatten is the loser.

Bobby Thomson has a HR and double to drive in 5 runs to power the Giants
to a 7-4 win over the Reds. Elliott and Mays also homer as Larry Jansen
wins his 10th straight over the Reds going back to August 29, 1948.

The Cardinals send OF Wally Westlake and SS Eddie Kazak to the Reds for
Dick Sisler and Virgil Stallcup.

1953
The Senators pick up Johnny Schmitz on waivers from the Yankees.

1954
In an 8-1 victory over the Reds at Connie Mack Stadium, Robin Roberts
gives up a lead-off homerun to Bobby Adams. The 27-year-old right-hander
then preceeds to retire the next 27 consecutive batters in one of the most
memorable games of his Hall of Fame career.

1955
It's Friday the 13th and bad luck for the Tigers as Mickey Mantle homers
from both sides of the plate for the first time. In all, Mantle has 3 HRs,
the first two lefty against starter Steve Gromek, and the third off Bob
Miller, all to the deep reaches of the right centerfield bleachers. Mick
adds a single, good for 5 RBIs as New York beats Detroit 5-2. Whitey Ford
goes seven innings for the win. Mantle joins Lazzeri (1927), Ben Chapman
(1932) and Dickey (1939) as the only Yanks to hits three homers in a game
at Yankee Stadium.

1956
The Braves destroy the Redlegs 15-0 and 6-1. In game one, Warren Spahn
homers as his offensive contribution to the win.

At Brooklyn, Duke Snider hits 2 homers, one a grand slam, as the Dodgers
beat the Giants, 6-4. Furillo's homer provides the other score. It is the
Duke's first slam at Ebbets.

1958
With a pinch-hit double, Stan Musial collects his 3000th hit in the sixth
inning off Moe Drabowsky in the Cardinals' 5-3 victory over the Cubs at
Wrigley Field. 'The Man', the youngest player to reach the milestone,
is the eighth major leaguer to accomplish the feat.

Willie Mays goes 5 for 5 against the Dodgers, as the Giants win 16-9. Mays
has another 2 HRs, plus 2 triples and 4 RBIs to compete with Daryl Spencer's
2 HRs, triple, double and 6 RBIs. The Giants pound out 26 hits, while the
Dodgers collect 11, the longest being Charlie Neal's HR over the distant RF
fence at the Coliseum. The Giants set a ML-record (since 1900) as 5 players
collect 4 hits apiece.

1959
Milwaukee's Warren Spahn becomes the 3rd NL lefty to win 250 games, beating
the Cards 3-2.

1960
Mike McCormick's shutout of the Dodgers is the 3rd straight by San Francisco
pitchers, following 2-hitters against Philadelphia by Sam Jones and Jack
Sanford. The first-place Giants have 7 straight wins.

Pirate Dick Groat becomes the first NL player since Connie Ryan in 1953 to
go 6 for 6 as Pittsburgh beats Milwaukee, 8-2.

Philadelphia suffers its 3rd straight 1-0 shutout, losing to the Reds in
Cincinnati. The Phillies, losers of back-to-back 1-0 games in San Francisco,
tie the ML record for straight 1-0 losses. Jim O'Toole's win is Cincinnati's
9th straight. The Phils announce a trade of 1B Ed Bouchee and P Don Cardwell
to the Cubs for 2B Tony Taylor and C Cal Neeman.

Two days after being traded from the Phillies to the Cubs, Don Cardwell
pitches a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. A brilliant, leaping
catch of Carl Sawatski's line drive by George Altman in the eighth inning
saves Cardwell's gem. Ernie Banks' homerun paces the 4-0 win, the first
no-hitter against the Cards since May 11, 1919.

1961
Rocky Colavito returns to the Tigers lineup and rocks the Yankees with a
4 for 5 game, including two homers. The Tigers win, 8-3.

the Giants whip the Braves, 8-5.

1964
The Reds buy Ryne Duran from the Phillies.

1965
Twenty-five-year-old Angels P Dick Wantz dies following brain surgery for
cancer. He appeared in one game, against Cleveland on April 13th, allowing
3 hits and striking out 2 in one inning.

1966
Giant Jim Davenport's 17th-inning HR beats the Mets 5-4 before 56,658 fans,
the largest night crowd ever at Shea Stadium. The first-place Giants (22-7)
now have 12 straight wins.

1967
At Fenway, the Tigers outslug the Red Sox, 10-8, with the victory going to
Moose Korince. Moose will end his career this year at 10, the only undefeated
Canadian pitcher in the majors.

1968
University of Denver defeats the Air Force Academy 33-29, establishing a
record for most runs by a losing team and the most total bases in a game
(104).

1969
Cubs 1B Ernie Banks has 7 RBI-including his 1,500th - on 2 3-run homers
and a double in Chicago's 19-0 blowout against San Diego, matching the
biggest shutout margin in modern NL history. Cubs pitcher Dick Selma is
the recipient, allowing just 3 hits, while Dick Kelley takes the loss. The
Pads swapped Selma earlier in the season and he gives the Cubs their 3rd
shutout in a row. Banks, Williams and Randy Hundley leave after Oliver's
HR in the 6th makes it 14-0, and Don Young caps a 5-run 7th with a 3-run
homer. Selma's shutout follows consecutive shutouts by Jenkins and Holtzman.

With 19,072 fans on hand, the largest Seattle crowd of the season, the
Pilots beat the Yankees 5-3.

1970
The Mets' Gary Gentry stops the Cubs, 4-0, allowing just one hit. Bill
Hands is the losing pitcher.

1971
The Reds trade OF Angel Bravo to the Padres for OF Al Ferrara, who (as
noted by Reds historians Greg Rhodes and John Snyder) once played solo
piano at Carnegie Hall at age 12. After Ferrara hits .182 for the season,
he'll pose the question:  "What did you expect for Angel Bravo - Willie Mays?"

1972
The Brewers score in the top of the 22nd to win 4-3, then lose to the Twins
4-3 in 15 innings. The two games take 9 hours and 23 minutes to complete
and sets an AL record for consecutive innings played in two days.

1973
In the first of two, the Yankees tie a ML record by hitting 4 HRs in a
shutout game in which no other runs are scored. The mark was originally
set by Cleveland on August 2, 1956. White, Murcer, Blomberg and Nettles
hit solos in the 4-0 win over Baltimore. Mel Stottlemyre is the winner. The
Yanks jump on Dave McNally for 5 runs in game 2 but score zero when Eddie
Watts relieves him for 4 IP. Baltimore wins, 9-6.

1976
The Royals beat the White Sox, 13-2, as George Brett sets an AL record
by collecting 3 hits for the 6th consecutive game, breaking Rod Carew's
record. Brett had 3+ hits in games on May 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13th. The
only other player this century to collect 3+ hits in six straight games
was Brooklyn's Jimmy Johnston, in 1920. During the span, the Royals' third
baseman is 18 for 26 against the Orioles, Twins and White Sox.

At Seattle Fred Lynn, out with an ankle injury since March 24th, poles the
first pitch he sees from Dick Pole for a HR. He also homers on his 2nd at-bat.

the year, a 420-foot shot to dead center. Jeff Zahn takes the loss.

1979
The Padres' Randy Jones steals 2B against the Mets in a 5-4 San Diego
victory. He is the first pitcher in the team's 11-year history to do so.

1979, helping the Royals to a 14-5 triumph over the White Sox.

The Reds top the Pirates, 7-3, as newly acquired Paul Blair hits a 2-run
HR off John Candelaria. Dan Driessen also homers. Phil Garner has 3 hits,
including a homer, and 2 errors for the Bucs. Dave Parker has a single to
up his consecutive hitting streak against the Reds to 32 games, stretching
back to July 9, 1976 (as noted by Retrosheet).

1980

homeruns in one inning.

Fred Lynn hits for the cycle as the Red Sox beat the Twins, 10-5.

1982

homerun off Ron Davis is the finishing touch.

A day before his 43rd birthday, Tony Perez goes deep with the bases full
in the Reds' 7-3 victory over the Phillies at Riverfront Stadium to become
the oldest player to hit a grand slam. Previously, Pirates third baseman
Honus Wagner had gained the distinction as a 41-year-old in 1915. Carlton
Fisk will top this in 1991.

1986
Helped by an unusual 3-6-1-2-4 triple play in the first inning, Seattle goes
on to defeat Milwaukee 8-5. After Randy Ready and Ernest Riles walk to open
the game, Cecil Cooper hits a bouncer to 1B Alvin Davis, who throws to 2B to
force Riles. Cooper beats the return throw to 1B, but Ready is thrown out
trying to score, and Cooper is thrown out at 2B trying to advance during
the play at the plate.

1988
Barry Bonds hits a leadoff homer for the 2nd day in a row and the Pirates
edge the Reds, 6-5. Barry's father accomplished the same feat in 1973.

At Fenway, 9 homers are hit by the two teams, 2 by Mike Greenwell, as Boston
outslugs the Mariners, 14-8. Oil Can Boyd is kicked around but emerges with
the win.

1989
Kirby Puckett hits 4 doubles in the Twins' 10-8 win over the Blue Jays tying
the ML single-game record. He becomes the 35th player to hit 4 doubles in

Hippolito Pichardo of the Royals.

1994

8 hits in his last 12 at-bats with 8 RBIs.

1997
Eddie Murray gets 2 hits in Anaheim's 8-7 win over the White Sox. The

season. The defending World Series champions have won 17 of their last 23,
while the Twins lost for the 16th time in 20 games.

wins. The 35-year-old Arizona right-hander plans to give the game ball to
his dad, Mel, who began chemotherapy early this season for bone marrow cancer.

A day after failing to hustle, turning a likely double into a single, a
disgruntled Rickey Henderson is let go by the Mets. The 41-year-old stolen

10-5. Paul O'Neill hits a 2-out 2-run homer in the 9th to tie, but the O's
score 5 runs off Mariano Rivera in the 11th to win. The big blow is Jeff
Conine's HR.

The Cubs suffer a big loss when 3B Bill Mueller injures his knee sliding

after the Cubs score 6 runs against starter Hideo Nomo in the 2nd inning and
roll to a 7-3 win. Carlos Zambrano strikes out 11 in 8 IP. Lima is believed
to be the first player to sing the National Anthem since the Cubs Dwight
Smith on July 21, 1989.

Andruw Jones has a 3-run HR in the 1st and Adam LaRoche has 4 doubles in
the Braves' 11-6 win over the Brewers. Alfonseca (5-0), with 1 2/3 innings

former Brewers manager, Ned Yost.

2013

2005 amateur draft receives a mixed reaction from the crowd, with slightly
more cheers than boos during Atlanta's 10-1 rout of the Diamondbacks.

Thanks to a seventh-grade history class project, a three-mile stretch of
K-79 highway from K-16 highway to Circleville is designated as the Barnes
Brothers Memorial Highway in honor of Ozzie and Virgil, who grew up in the
community and played with the Braves, Giants and Dodgers in the 1910-20s. The
McAlister middle schoolers' research brought to light the many major league
accomplishments of the two siblings, including being participants in first
brother matchup in big league history.

2015
Corey Kluber becomes one of five pitchers to strike out 18 or more batters
without issuing a walk, joining Luis Tiant, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson
and Kerry Wood. The 29-year-old right-hander, who goes eight innings to get
the victory when the Indians beat St. Louis 2-0 in the Progressive Field
contest, also ties Johnson for the most strikeouts in a start lasting less
than nine innings.

2016
Chris Heisey's pinch-hit homerun, his third of the season, marks the
first time the Nationals have had two pinch-hitters go deep in the same

victory over Miami.

2021
Corbin Burnes of Milwaukee set the Major League record for most strikeouts
by a pitcher to begin a season without issuing a walk by getting Harrison
Bader of the St. Louis Cardinals. The second-inning strikeout was the 52nd
strikeout by Burnes and that broke the record held by Kenley Jansen set
in 2017. Burnes streak came to an end later in the game at 58 strikeouts,
when he walked Tommy Edman in the fifth inning. This was, at the time,
also a Major League record for most strikeouts without a walk.
