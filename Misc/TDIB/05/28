games only run.

1903
At Boston, the Pirates edge the Nationals, 7-6. Debuting for Pittsburgh is
outfielder Reddy Grey, brother of writer Zane Grey. He goes 1 for 3 in his
only ML appearance (Macmillan Encyclopedia has him 1 for 3 in another game).

1904
The Superbas score a run in the 10th against the Giants to take a 3-2 lead
at the Polo Grounds, but the Giants answer with a pair for a 4-3 win. After

the stands, 258 feet away for the dramatic win, Joe McGinnity's 12th straight.

1905
New York City's police commissioner instructs his policeman to stop any
Sunday baseball until the issue is resolved in the courts. The edict stops
the Giants-Brooklyn game scheduled today at Washington Park, and almost gets
Giants' ace Iron Joe McGinnity arrested. McGinnity is asked to pitch in
a semi-pro game at a field at 46th and 2nd Avenue, but upon arriving gets
into an argument about money and refuses to put on a uniform. The police
move in and arrest all the players except Joe, who is in street clothes.

1909
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Phils split two. The Phils win the
opener, 11-1, then lose to Christy Mathewson, 3-0, in a rain-shortened 6
inning affair.

1910

against the Giants, and exits with the score 6-6. Tom Seaton relieves,
but the Giants finally score in the 14th to win, 7-6.

1914
In the 8th, Boston's Harry Hooper leads a successful triple steal (Hooper,
Lewis and Speaker) against Cleveland that results in a 2-2 tie, but Washington
scores 3 in the 9th to win. With Rip Hagerman on the mound in the 8th inning,
Dode Birmingham, Fred Carisch and Ivan Olson get tossed for protesting too
vigorously. Tris Speaker, on the back end of the triple swipe today will
be on the front end of another Red Sox triple steal.

1916
It's shutout day in the AL:  Carl Mays submarines the Yankees, 3-0, for the
visiting Red Sox, and the White Sox take two from the Indians, both by 2-0
scores. The winning pitchers are Jim Scott and Red Faber.

Jimmy Claxton, signed as an American Indian, pitches in both games for
Oakland (PCL) in a doubleheader against Los Angeles. He takes the loss in
game 1. When it is found out that he is African American, Oakland will release
him on June 3rd. Claxton will be the first black to appear on a baseball card.

1918
At Fenway, Boston's Joe Bush pitches a one-hit 1-0 win over the Chicago White
Sox and drives in the lone run. The lone Chicago hit is a "flying single"

5 appearances for the Pirates, who ship him back to Boston on June 30,
and he'll not appear the rest of the year.

1921
The league-leading Pirates protest their 4-3 10-inning loss to the Reds. When
hot-tempered Reds P Dolf Luque throws the ball into the Cincinnati dugout,
Clyde Barnhart tries to take 3B and is thrown out. The Pirates claim the ball
was dead when it went into the dugout. NL president Heydler will sustain
the protest and order the game continued with the score 3-3 in the last of
the 8th. The Pirates win the replay 4-3 on June 30th.

In the first of 2 against the A's to start a homestand, Carl Mays holds the
Mackmen to one run and the Yankees win, 5-1. Mays has now won 13 straight

in a game by clanging 5 straight in a Texas League game against Dallas.

1924
In the first game of a twinbill in St. Louis, Reds P Allen Sothoron beans
Cards 1B Jake Daubert in the 1st inning. Daubert homered yesterday against
the Cards. The veteran star is able to walk to the dugout and is quickly
taken to a hospital where X-rays show no fracture. Daubert will be out 2
weeks and at the end of the season will die of a failed appendectomy. The
doctor who signs the death certificate will list as a secondary cause:
"a concussion resulting from pitched ball." A few years later Daubert's
widow will file a lawsuit against the Reds. Sothoron wins, 6-0, today and
the Reds take the nitecap, 5-3.

The Red Sox and A's split a doubleheader with the A's winning the opener,
2-1, and Boston the second game, 1-0. Ira Flagstead's leadoff homer off
Roy Meeker is the only score of the game. With the Yankees splitting,
the Sox and New York remain tied for first.

1925
The Cubs tally 11 hits and score 12 runs in the 7th inning to break open
the game and win 13-3 at Cincinnati. In the 7th, Barney Friberg doubles
and triples, Charlie Grimm has a single and double, and Arnie Statz and
pitcher Wilbur Cooper each have two singles.

At Braves Field, Giants catcher Frank Snyder breaks an 8th inning tie with
a 430-foot drive over the left field wall, the first homerun ever hit over
the left field barrier at Braves Field. New York wins, 8-6.

Despite pitching yesterday, Johnson comes back to pitch the 2nd game today
in Philadelphia and opposing pitcher Bill Harriss pops a 2-run 2nd inning
homer off the Big Train. The A's win, 9-4 after losing the opener, 11-3.

1926
A Boston-New York old-timers' game is played for a Christy Mathewson

16-game win streak.

1927
In his first starting assignment, New York's Wilcy Moore loses a heartbreaker
to the Senators, 3-2, in the nitecap of a twinbill. Gehrig is spiked at
1B by Bucky Harris as Firpo Marberry scores the winning run. The Yanks
win the opener, 8-2, as Ruth uncorks his 12th homer of the year, a 3-run
shot. Tris Speaker plays most of game one despite fracturing his left thumb
in batting practice.

Behind Lee Meadows' 7th win without a loss, the Pirates win their 10th in
a row, beating the Cardinals, 6-4. The win streak has pushed the Bucs into
first place.

previous evening he had complained about stomach cramps while sitting
with teammates in the lobby of Chicago's Carlos Hotel, where he had
a room. Hours later, he called the Cubs trainer saying he was in great
pain and an ambulance was called. But Carlson dies before the ambulance
arrived. He was 4-2 for the year, and had won 114 games over a 14-year career.

Phillie Grover Cleveland Alexander makes his last ML appearance, giving up
2 hits and 2 runs in relief as the Braves win, 5-1. The Phillies release
him a few hours after the game.

1934
In St. Louis, Gehrig hits a 6th-inning homer, off Paul Andrews, then follows
Ruth's 7th-inning homer with another round tripper. The back-to-back homers,
off Jack Knott, are the last the pair will combine on. New York gets homers
from Saltgaver and Lazzeri to rumble to a 13-9 victory.

1935

line drive by Cleveland's Earl Averill in the 3rd inning. After he finishes

beating Boston, 13-4. Babe Ruth is 0 for 3, scoring a run, but stumbles
twice and injures his leg running and is replaced in LF by Lee.

1936
At Wrigley Reds pitcher Al Hollingsworth stakes himself to a 4-0 lead by
belting a grand slam off Chicago's Lon Warneke in the top of the 2nd. He
then surrenders 7 runs in the bottom of the frame and eventually loses,
11-5. Johnson, Stine and English get tossed after a bench-clearing brawl
erupts in the 3rd. The Cubs won two days ago by scoring 7 runs in the 3rd.

1938
Carl Hubbell allows just a walk and a single to Tuck Stainback and the
Giants pile on the Phillies, 11-0.

1939
Robert Joyce, who gave up two HRs to New York's George Selkirk yesterday,
relieves for the A's. Selkirk hits two more HRs off Joyce, giving him 4
HRs in 4 at-bats against the same pitcher in two successive games. Yankees
win, 9-5. The Yanks release vet Wes Ferrell, who never came back after arm
surgery over the winter. Ferrell will appear with the Dodgers in '40 and
the Braves in 1941.

against Cleveland in the 10th. He will be out of action for 2 months. The
Indians push across a run in the 11th to win for Early Wynn, 3-2. Wynn
allows 4 hits and retires the last 21 batters in a row.

The A's Lou Brissie loses a tough one, 2-1, to the Yankees in 14 innings. Yogi
Berra does the most damage driving in a run in the 9th with a double,
then scoring from 1st on a double in the 14th. Joe Page is the winner.

In Don Newcombe's Ebbets Field debut, the Dodgers stake him to a 6-0 lead
over the Braves. But Boston rallies to tie it at 6 apiece, led by Pete
Reiser's 8th inning grand slam, and wins, 7-6.

1951
After starting his career 0 for 12, Giants rookie Willie Mays gets his first
hit, a 450-foot homer off Braves left-hander Warren Spahn. Ironically it is
the first of 18 homeruns the 'Say Hey Kid' will hit off the Hall of Fame
hurler, the most he will hit off any one pitcher. The Giants lose today's
game 4-1.

Newly acquired White Sox hurler Saul Rogovin 2-hits the Browns in a 4-2 win.

1952
Willie Mays is 0 for 4 in his last game as a civilian, but the Giants top

a 7-5 win over the Indians. Paige picks up his 2nd save in 2 nights.

Steve Bilko ties his 2nd ML record in less than 24 hours. Bilko struck out 5
times in a row at Cincy last night, and today hits a record-tying 2 doubles
(last done by the Braves' Thorpe last season) in the Cards' 10-run 4th inning
against the Braves. Gerry Staley still needs help in the 9th to win, 11-7.

1954
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants whip the Dodgers 17-6 with a 6-HR
barrage. Four of the HRs come in the 8th as Davey Williams, Alvin Dark, Monte
Irvin and Billy Gardner connect off Ben Wade. Whitey Lockman, in the 1st,
and Willie Mays, in the 2nd account for the other two. Brooklyn scores a run
in the 6th when Giants P Marv Grissom balks home Rube Walker from 3B. Catcher
Ray Katt is at fault, having called a time out when Grissom is in his windup.

It's the managers' day for the bicarb, as White Sox (14) and Oriole (18)
pitchers combine to hand out 32 walks in a doubleheader. In the first game,
the Birds send up an AL record 8 pinch hitters (the Sox use 1 for a new
ML-record 9). But all is for naught as the White Sox win both, 11-6 and
14-8. Gene Michaels clubs a grand slam in the lidlifter to help reliever
Jack Harshman win his first ML game.

At Boston, Joe Collins' 9th inning walk - the 20th of the game - turns into
the winning run in the 9th as New York beats the Red Sox, 10-9. The Yanks
overcome a grand slam by Jackie Jensen.

1955
Johnny Groth bangs 4 extra bases hits - 2 HRs and 2 doubles - as the White

run. The Sox take over 3rd place from the Bengals.

Harry "the Hat" Walker replaces Eddie Stanky as manager of the Cardinals
with the team in 5th place with a record of 17-19.

After starting the season on the retired list, Ted Williams of the Red Sox
becomes "unretired." He joins the team and collects a single in his first
at-bat, but the Red Sox bow to the Senators, 5-3. Pascual is the starter,
but receives a warning from the ump when the Cuban Cutie twice hits Sammy
White with pitches. His replacement, Maurie McDermott, ignites a 5-run 6th
with a HR.

1956
Dale Long of the Pirates connects against the Dodgers Carl Erskine at
Forbes Field for his 8th HR in 8 games, a record that will stand until the
Yankees Don Mattingly equals it in 1987. Pittsburgh wins, 3-2, behind Bob
Friend's 2-hitter. Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Jr will also equal the
record in 1993.

White Sox SS Luis Aparicio hits his first ML HR, off Kansas City's Tom
Lasorda, to open the Sox scoring in the 5th. With the score tied 4-4 in
the 9th, reliever Billy Pierce walks Lopez, and Enos Slaughter then wins
the game with a homerun.

The White Sox buy P Gerry Staley from the Yankees.

1957
With an unanimous vote, National League owners grant permission to both the
Dodgers and Giants to move their clubs to the West Coast if the clubs so
desire provided both clubs make their request before October 1st and move
at the same time. There will not be a National League team in New York
next season.

Reds pitcher Don Gross has his no-hitter snapped in the 8th inning when
Milwaukee's Bobby Thomson triples. Frank Torre singles home Thomson and
the Braves win, 1-0.

1960
Casey Stengel is hospitalized with a virus and high fever and will miss 13
games. New York goes 7-6 under interim manager Ralph Houk. Today the Yanks top
the Senators, 5-1, behind Jim Coates' 5th straight win. The game is scoreless
until Mantle cracks a 5th inning opposite field homer off Jim Kaat, who then
walks three, hits two batters, and serves up a Gil McDougald 2-run triple
good for 3 runs. Later Mantle homers again, and Maris, leading the AL, also
homers, the first time the two have hit round trippers together in a game.

At Forbes Field in the 8th inning, Clemente is on 3B and Smith on 1B with 2
outs, when Mazeroski fans on a ball that hits in the front of the plate. The
ball then hits Umpire Al Barlick on the right knee and bounces back toward
Phillies pitcher, Jim Owens. Maz doesn't move as Smith jogs to 2B. Clemente
races in from 3B then stops. Owens fields the ball and goes after Clemente
ignoring pleas from the Phils' bench to simply throw to 1B. In the run-down,
Clemente knocks the ball out of Jim Coker's glove and scores the tying run
on the catcher's error (the photo has been widely published). The Pirates
win, 4-2 in the 13th on Don Hoak's 2-run HR.

1961
After losing the first game 14-9 at home to Chicago, the Yankees take the
nightcap 5-3 with the help of a Roger Maris HR. Maris' 9th HR of the season
is one of 27 hit in today's 7 AL games - a record. Twelve more in 4 NL
games make a total of 39, a one-day ML record for 11 games in the 2 leagues.

hit a pair in both the games against the Expos on the 24th and 25th.

1971
The Braves Clete Boyer, involved in a dispute with owner Paul Richards and

Chicago's rubber-armed knuckleballer Wilbur Wood wins the completion
of a suspended game, allowing 2 hits and an unearned run in 5 innings,
winning 6-3 on Dick Allen's 3 run homerun in the 21st. Wood then shuts down
Cleveland on 4 hits in the regularly scheduled contest. After the White Sox'
first 40 games, Wood's record is a remarkable 13-3.

At Chavez Ravine, the Dodgers' Andy Messersmith strikes out the 1st six
Phillies' batters. The Phils still win 5-1.

1976
Ron LeFlore's 31-game hitting streak comes to an end when Ed Figueroa and
Tippy Martinez hold him hitless in four at-bats in Detroit's 9-5 loss to

winning pitcher. Brett is the last player this century to have 2 homers in
a game where he cycles. Before Brett, Yaz in 1965 was the last to include
a 2nd homer with his cycle.

Texas Rangers first baseman Mike Jorgensen is hit in the head by a pitch from
Boston Red Sox pitcher Andy Hassler. Dave Roberts comes into the game to
pinch run for Jorgensen, and Pat Putnam takes over as the Rangers' regular
first baseman for the next month. Aside from a pinch-hit appearance on May
31, Jorgensen does not play again until July 1. After suffering headaches,
it is discovered he has a small blood clot inside his head, which apparently
caused a seizure and could have resulted in his early demise.

1980
In Oakland's 6-3 win over Kansas City, Dwayne Murphy and Rickey Henderson

by Jim Deshaies before the season's end.

1987
Cleveland's Joe Carter hits 3 homeruns in a game in Boston's Fenway Park
for the 2nd time in his career, but the Indians fall to the Red Sox 12-8.

Baltimore's Mike Young ties a ML record by hitting a pair of extra inning
homeruns, connecting consecutively in the 10th and 12th innings off DeWayne
Buise. He's just the 5th major leaguer to do it and the first since Ralph
Garr, in 1971. The Orioles edge the Angels, 8-7.

1988
The Padres fire manager Larry Bowa and replace him with Jack McKeon, who is
also the club's vice president of baseball operations. McKeon's son-in-law,
Greg Booker, has pitched in 17 of the first 46 Padre games, but will appear
in just 17 games the rest of the year.

Seattle's infield records 22 assists in a 6-1 win over the Yankees, a ML

extra bases on long hits (45), with Detroit contributing 24. The Sox start
rookie James Baldwin (25 hits and 15 runs in 13 1/3 innings) and Detroit
greets him with a leadoff HR by Curtis, a walk, single and 3-run homer by
Fielder. Curtis and Fielder each homer in the 2nd to finish the rookie. The
Sox sink David Wells with successive homers in the 4th by Durham, Karkovice
and Grebeck. Cecil Fielder, Chad Curtis, Kirk Gibson and Ron Karkovice each
homer twice, setting another AL mark for the most players with 2 HRs in a
game. Ray Durham, Craig Grebeck, Frank Thomas and Lou Whitaker also connect
for 4-baggers. Detroit's Danny Bautista, anxious to join the HR derby, fans
5 times (on 18 pitches) in 6 at-bats to tie another mark for a 9 inning game.

The Braves' Greg Maddux allows one hit - an 8th inning homer by Jeff Bagwell
- in downing the Astros, 3-1.

The Padres defeat the Phillies, 13-5, in 10 innings. The 9 runs they score

Reds also accomplished the feat.

1996
At Anaheim, Kenny Rogers loses his no-hitter in the 8th when Garrett Anderson
hits a lead off single, and loses the game in the 9th when he walks Chili

1998
With Arizona leading the Giants, 8-6, in the bottom of the 9th with the bases
loaded, manager Buck Showalter orders reliever Gregg Olson to intentionally
walk Barry Bonds to bring home the Giants' 7th run. It is only the 4th
bases-loaded intentional walk in major league history and the first since
Swish Nicholson on July 23, 1944. Today's free pass works when the next
batter, Brett Mayne, lines outs to deep center field giving Arizona an 8-7
victory at Candlestick Park.

1999
The Red Sox defeat the Indians, 12-5, despite 5 passed ball by C Jason
Varitek, who has trouble catching Tim Wakefield's knuckleball. Varitek, who
has 3 PBs in the 1st inning, falls one short of the ML record for a single
game. He atones for his fielding sins by stroking 3 hits, including a HR.

Yankee OF Darryl Strawberry pleads no contest to cocaine possession and
solicitation charges, and is sentenced to 18 months probation.

Reds. Guttierez hits a 2-run homer in the 13th after an Eric Young RBI
single. Reds 1B Sean Casey leaves the game with a strained lower back, and
the Reds use 3 more first basemen, tying a NL mark set by the Phillies,
on July 23, 1964. The 2 teams combine to tie the major league record by
using 6 players at first base ... the mark was set by the White Sox (5)
and Yankees (1) on June 25, 1953.

The Marlins (22-26) fire manager John Boles, reacting in part to players'
grumbling for a year about his approach. Reliever Dan Miceli was the most

organized ball. Tony Perez agrees to manage until a new manager is found,
then agrees to finish the year. Under Perez, the Marlins will go 54-60.

2002
Arizona's Miguel Batista hurls 9 innings of 1-hit ball against the Giants,
but the Giants win in 10 innings, 1-0. Bonds walks off Myers, and Jeff
Kent's 2nd hit of the game, off Prinz, moves him to 3rd. Santiago's single
wins it. Nen, in relief of Jason Schmidt, picks up the win.

2003
When Rafael Furcal, Mark DeRosa and Gary Sheffield all go deep off the Reds'
Jeff Austin in the bottom of the first inning, the Braves become only the
second team in big league history to begin a game with three consecutive
homeruns. In San Diego's home opener in 1987, the Padres wasted no time
making up a two-run first inning deficit as each of the first three batters -
Marvell Wynn, Tony Gwynn and John Kruk - all went yard in the bottom of the
first inning off Giant starter Roger Mason. Today Javy Lopez also homers
in the first inning for the Braves, to tie the ML record of 4 homers in
an inning. They slug a total of 6 in the game. Starter Jeff Austin, who
serves up the 3 dingers, makes his second straight start without retiring
a batter. The Braves pound the Reds, 15-3.

Rob Mackowiak of the Pittsburgh Pirates has a day to remember. In the morning,
his wife gives birth to his first son. Later that day, his walk-off grand
slam in the 9th inning offsets an eight-inning grand slam by Michael Barrett
and gives the Pirates a 9-5 win over the Chicago Cubs in the first game
of a doubleheader. In the second game, Mackowiak hits a 2-run HR in the
bottom of the 9th to tie the score. Pittsburgh goes on to win the game in
the 10th, 5-4, on Craig Wilson's homer. It is just the 3rd time in history
that a doubleheader has ended with two walkoff homers. The other times were
July 25, 1967 and May 12, 1962. In the first game, Matt Clement becomes
the twenty-first big league pitcher, and the first Cubs hurler in over a
century, to hit three batters in one inning. The right-hander ties a major
league record when he plunks Bobby Hill, Jason Kendall and Craig Wilson in
the fifth inning.

2005
In the eighth inning of the Red Sox 17-1 rout over the Yankees in New
York, the largest margin of victory the team has ever enjoyed against
their rivals, the stadium scoreboard goes blank for a few moments when the
operator cannot keep up with the Boston barrage. The BoSox' 27 hits, one
shy of a Bronx Bomber record for hits allowed, are the most collected by
the club since tying the team record of 28 in June of 2003, ironically in
a game also started by Carl Pavano as the opposing pitcher, but in a Marlin
uniform. Johnny Damon and Manny Ramirez each get 4 hits today for Boston.

At Great American Ball Park, the number 10 joins 5 (Bench), 8 (Morgan),
24 (Perez), 20 (F. Robinson), 1 (Hutchinson) and 18 (Kluszewski) on the
facade of the press box, when the Reds retire Sparky Anderson's uniform
number. As the skipper of the 'Big Red Machine', George Lee Anderson became
the franchise's winningest manager (863-586) and captured four NL pennants
(1970, 1972, 1975-76) and two World Championships (1975-76).

marked the team's 19th victory since May 1.

In Phoenix, Javier Vazquez holds off a Dodger rally in the 6th and clubs a
homer in the 7th off reliever Duaner Sanchez to tie the game. He then gets
lifted before throwing another pitch as the Diamondbacks earn a 5-4 win
over Los Angeles. Luis Terrero, batting against Sanchez, hits a bouncer up
the middle that goes high over Sanchez' head. Sanchez throws his glove at
the ball and hits it, knocking it down. His throw to first is late but no
matter as Terrero is awarded a unique infield triple.

2006
At AT&T Park, Barry Bonds passes Babe Ruth on the all-time homerun list taking
sole possession of second place when he hits the 715th homer of his 21-year
big league career. The historic homer, which comes off a 90-mph fastball
thrown by Byung-Hyum Kim of the Rockies, makes the Giants outfielder the
most prolific left-handed slugger in baseball history. The Rockies defeat
the Giants, 6-3.

After the Chicago Cubs rally for four runs in the 9th to tie, the Braves
edge them, 13-12, in 11 innings. Atlanta hits a club record 8 homers in the
victory at windy Wrigley Field as Marcus Giles, Edgar Renteria (2), Andruw
Jones, Adam LaRoche (2), Ryan Langerhans and Brayan Pena go deep. For the
Cuban born Pena, it is his first ML homer. The Cubs, with no homers, bang
out 16 hits, including 4 by Tony Womack, to hang in there before Giles'
single in the 11th scores the winner. The Braves are helped when Aramis
Ramirez is hit in the head by a pop fly.

2007

in a nearby storage area. With plumes of smoke visible coming from the
top level of the ball park on the first base side, the crowd is informed
by the public address announcer that it will not be necessary to evacuate
the entire stadium.
