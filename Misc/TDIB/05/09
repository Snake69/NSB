with rain coming down, the Sox use singles by Sam Mertes and Dutch Hartman
off Moore, "The Steam Engine in Boots", to score 2 runs and win, 4-2. The
threatening weather keeps the crowd to 400 at League Park. For years this
will be considered the AL's first no-hitter, but in 1991 Moore will lose
this accolade. Moore will compile a 16-14 record this year in the big leagues.

Times (May 10) reports that Kittridge and Kip Selbach are traded to the

Johnson pitches in relief in the 10th inning and picks up his 3rd win in 9
days against Boston, a 4-3 win for Washington. The only Red Sox safety in

a ten-game hit streak.

1920
Indians ace P Stan Coveleski wins his 6th straight, beating the White Sox,

(7 innings) and George Pipgras are the New York hurlers.

1933
The Red Sox sell Earl Webb to the White Sox.

1935
The Braves' Rabbit Maranville sets a new record for NL service by appearing

last year's spring training. The Rabbit has a single but Tex Carleton is
too much for the Braves and the Cubs win, 8-1.

At Philadelphia, Charley Gelbert of the Cardinals plays his first game since
a 1932 hunting accident almost severed his leg. Gelbert's error in the

Red Sox to a 15-3 drubbing of Cleveland. Jim Bagby is the winner.

ends 1-1 after 9 innings.

After 552 relief appearances, Mike Stanton starts a major league game
breaking Gary Lavelle's record for most appearances prior to starting a game
(443). The southpaw shut outs Seattle for four innings, giving up two hits,
in New York's 6-1 victory at Yankee Stadium.

The Pirates defeat the Cardinals, 12-9, as SS Pat Meares gets 5 hits,
including a double. Brant Brown adds a 3-run inside-the-park homer.

2000
The Cardinals score 8 runs in the 2nd inning on their way to a 13-6 win
over the Giants.

2001
Although the deed will not be officially recognized as tying a record because
the game against the Reds goes extra innings, Diamondback southpaw fireballer
Randy Johnson joins Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood as the only pitchers ever
to strike out 20 hitters over nine innings. After being pulled in the ninth,
the three-time Cy Young Award winner does not get an opportunity to break
Senators Tom Cheney's major league mark of 21 strikeouts recorded in a
16-inning contest on September 12, 1962 against the Orioles.

Red Sox 2B Chris Stynes, who had 3 hits in yesterday's win, suffers 2
fractures in his left cheekbone when he is hit by an Aaron Sele pitch in
the 2nd inning. He'll miss 6 weeks. Seattle breaks a 5-5 tie in the 8th on
Olerud's double to win, 10-5. David Bell has 4 RBI for the M's, while Trot
Nixon homers and Ramirez and O'Leary go back-to-back in the 4th.

2002
In a 3-1 Yankee victory over Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field, Mariano Rivera
saves his 225th game as a Yankee to establish a new franchise record. The
previous mark of 224 was set in 1990 by Dave Righetti.

2004
Trailing 14-4 in the middle of the fifth inning at the Ballpark in Arlington,
the Rangers rally to beat the Tigers in 10 innings, 16-15. The double digit
deficit is overcome when Texas tallies ten times in the bottom of the fifth
inning after allowing eight runs in the top of the frame.

2005
Oakland knuckles under to Tim Wakefield (4-1) and the Red Sox, 13-5, as
Trot Nixon and Kevin Millar help with homeruns. A's manager Ken Macha of
the Oakland A's gets thumbed out by ump Mark Carlsen, the first ejection
he's ever had. He was never ejected as a player beginning in 1974.

2006
After 1,914 games behind the plate, Ivan Rodriguez plays first base making it
the first time in his career he is at a position other than catcher. Later
in the season, 'Pudge' also makes an appearance at second base filling in
for injured Tiger infielder Placido Polanco.

Delmon Young is suspended for 50 games by the International League for
throwing a bat which hit a replacement umpire in the chest. The Devil Rays'
top prospect, the brother of Tiger star Dmitri Young, was selected as the
minor league player of the year by Baseball America in 2005.

2007
On his 22nd birthday, Jarrod Saltalamacchia makes his major league debut. With
14 letters in his last name, the Braves backstop has the longest surname in
baseball history besting 15 other major leaguers who played with 13 letters
in their family name.

2008
Kenny Rogers of the Detroit Tigers becomes the all-time career pickoff
leader with 92. Rogers picks off Wilson Betemit of the New York Yankees,
passing Mark Langston.

2010
Dallas Braden, recently made infamous due to his words with Alex Rodriguez
when the Yankee third baseman cut across the diamond via the pitcher's mound,
throws the 19th perfect game in baseball history, a 4-0 victory over the
Rays in Oakland. In attendance for the 26-year-old left-hander's Mother's
Day gem is his grandmother, who raised him after his mom died of a melanoma
during his senior year at Stagg High School in Stockton, California.

2011
Milton Bradley, playing for his eighth club since his Expos debut in 2000,
is cut by the Mariners, who still owe him the remaining part of his $13
million deal for this season. Although no specific incident triggers the
team's decision, the 33-year-old slumping outfielder had recently been
suspended for a game after bumping an umpire, ejected from another contest
for contesting a third strike, and a few days ago he became the target of
the Seattle fans' wrath for what they perceived as his lack of hustle.

2015
With runners on second and third, the Pirates turn the first recorded 5-4-5
triple play in baseball history, recording all three outs entirely on the
left side of the infield. The oddity occurs when Yadier Molina lines out
to second baseman Neil Walker (1), who throws to third baseman Jung Ho
Kang to double up Jhonny Peralta (2), who had strayed too far off third,
and then fields the third baseman's return throw to triple up Jason Heywood
at second base (3).

2019
Albert Pujols recorded his 2,000th career RBI with a homerun in the third
inning against the Detroit Tigers. He becomes the third player to reach
this mark, joining Hank Aaron and Alex Rodriguez.
