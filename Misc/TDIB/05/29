May 29

1903
At the Polo Grounds, Mathewson tosses his 2nd shut out of the year, blanking
Boston, 3-0, to keep New York in first place. A split with Boston tomorrow
will drop them a half game off the pace.

1904
In a Sunday game in Brooklyn, Hooks Wiltse makes his first ML start a good
one, beating the Superbas, 5-3. Hooks adds 2 hits as the Giants sweep all
5 games from Brooklyn to remain in a tie for 1st with Chicago.

1905
The Giants split an a.m.-p.m. twinbill with Brooklyn, winning the morning
game 7-2 and dropping the nitecap, 4-3. Elmer Stricklett, an early proponent
of the spitball (some account have him introducing the spitter to the NL),
allows just 5 Giant hits in the win.

At Pittsburgh, Dave Brain hits 3 triples to pace the Cardinals to a 6-3
win over the Pirates. He'll match that mark on August 8.

1908
At Ebbets Field, Christy Mathewson rights himself and shuts out Brooklyn
for a 1-0 Giants win. Matty gives up 4 hits and K's 8, in beating Nap Rucker.

1909
At Pittsburgh's Exposition Field, President William Taft and his half
brother Charles, a part owner of the Cubs, are among the overflow crowd
of 14,000 on hand for the Chicago-Pirates game. The visitors break open
the 3-3 game in the 11th by scoring 5 runs to win for Three-Finger Brown
and move Chicago just percentage points behind the Bucs. Both teams leave
immediately to play two games tomorrow in Chicago. Today is the only time
the Pirates will be defeated in a span of 19 games.

The A's sweep a doubleheader from the visiting Red Sox, 6-2 and 6-4. In
game 1 the A's Frank Baker belts the first homer ever hit over the RF wall
at the new Shibe Park. His drive comes off Red Sox hurler Frank Arellanes.

1911
Carrying the Cubs from St. Louis, the Pennsylvania Railroad sets a speed
record, covering the 191 miles from Columbus, Ohio to Pittsburgh in 215
minutes. Arriving in time for the game, the Cubs win, 4-1, with 4 runs in
the 4th inning. Joe Tinker's triple is the big blow.

1912
At Fenway Park, the second-place Red Sox take two from Washington 21-8
and 12-11 in 8 innings. Joe Wood wins the opener, allowing 11 hits, while
Boston collects 18 hits and 15 walks. The two squads combine for 59 hits
for 77 total bases.

Detroit whips the Browns, 7-5, in 14 innings with the help of a last-inning
error and wild pitch. Cobb has 3 hits including a triple and has now hit
in 23 straight games against the Browns (as noted by Trent McCotter). Cobb
will match this streak versus one club in 1917-1918, but never top it.

1915
Babe Ruth allows one hit through 8 innings but his Red Sox lose, 2-1, in the
9th when the A's Harry Davis hits a 2-run pinch single off the Babe. Boston
takes the 2nd game, 6-5.

The Cardinals and Pirates are scoreless in the first of 2 games when an
hour-long rain delays the game after 5 innings. The umpires declare it a
tie and start the 2nd game, which the Cards win 5-3 with a 5-run first.

1916
Christy Mathewson beats the Braves, 3-0, for the Giants' 17th consecutive
win on the road. Matty gives up just 4 singles in beating Dick Rudolph. New
York is only 1 1/2 games behind the leading Dodgers.

1917
The visiting Red Sox sweep two from the Senators, winning 2-1 behind Dutch
Leonard, and 9-0 behind Babe Ruth. The Sox will sweep two more tomorrow.

1919
Boston's Carl Mays allows just 4 hits in beating the A's, 7-1 at
Philadelphia. No runners reach base after the 3rd inning (as noted by
historian Ted Farmer).

1920
The Senators take two from the A's, winning 11-5 and 5-0. In the second
game Walter Johnson plunks the first two batters, then cruises against
the gun-shy Philadelphia lineup. Val Picinich has a homer, off Roy Moore,
in the Nats' 4-run 4th.

The first place Cubs make it 6 straight wins, beating the Cards, 8-5, in a
game in which base stealing determines the outcome. For Chicago, a double
steal by Hollocher and Paskert helps, while the Cards drive Claude Hendrix
from the mound in the 8th inning, then end the rally when Doc Lavan swipes
third base, already occupied by teammate Jack Fournier.

1921
At Redland Field, Pittsburgh's Clyde Barnhart hits a 9th inning line drive
down the RF line that gets lost in tarp in front of the grandstand. By
the time RF Pat Duncan finds the ball, Barnhart scores his first ML homer
inside-the-park to tie the match at 2-2. Eppa Rixey gives up the homer but
holds on for a 4-3 13-inning victory. It is the only homer Rixey will allow
in 301 innings pitched, and just one of 2 homers Reds pitchers will allow
at home this season. Except for this, Rixey would have set the record for
post-dead ball pitchers, a record that Allen Sothoron will post this year
in fewer innings.

The AL-leading Indians complete a sweep of 4 games with the Browns by winning,
11-9, behind George Uhle. Cleveland totals 15 hits in 8 innings against
Urban Shocker. In all 4 wins the Tribe score in double figures. Graney and
Williams each have 2 homers, and Elmer Smith clubs one.

1922
The U.S. Supreme Court rules baseball is a sport and not a business (which
exempts major league clubs from antitrust laws and interstate commerce
rules), and the Baltimore Feds lose their case. The request for a rehearing
will be denied.

The Browns top Detroit, 9-6, paced by Ken Williams' grand slam in the 3rd
inning. Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb get into an argument with the umpires
and will be suspended, missing tomorrow's twinbill.

Against Philadelphia, the Yankees plate 7 runs in the 7th to beat the
Athletics, 7-4. Carl Mays is the winner, notching his 20th straight victory
over the A's.

In the 9th inning at Ebbets Field, pinch hitter Clarence Mitchell,
batting for starter Leon Cadore, hits a two-run homer, but the Dodgers
come up short, losing to Boston, 5-4. Mitchell's blast is the first
pinch homer by a Dodgers P.

1927
In a loosely played game at Yankee Stadium, the Yanks swamp the Red Sox,
15-7, scoring 7 runs in the 8th inning. Babe Ruth propels his 13th homer,
off Danny MacFayden, while Johnny Grabowski is 4 for 4 with a walk. Ruether
is ineffective, serving up gopher balls to Bosox Hartley in the 2nd and
Haney in the 3rd. The Sox give it back in the 4th with 3 walks, 2 errors,
a single by Meusel and a double by Koenig, to make 4 runs. Ted Wingfield,
pitching 2/3 of the 4th, takes the loss.

1928
At Ebbets Field, Bill Terry hits for the cycle to pace the Giants to a 12-5
victory over the Robins (Dodgers). The New York first baseman is the first
player in major league history to include a grand slam as part of the cycle.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yankees sweep a pair from Washington, 3-2 and
12-3. Leo Durocher's bases-loaded triple in the opener gives George Pipgras
(8-1) the win. Gehrig and Ruth both slug a pair of homers in the nitecap:
Lou hits his 9th in the 3rd, off Washington starter Milt Gaston, then Ruth
and Gehrig hit back-to-back dingers in the 4th off Lloyd Brown. Ruth adds
his 18th off Brown in the 7th. Combs also homers.

The Reds lose another star when CF Ethan Allen is beaned and breaks his
cheek in an exhibition game in Buffalo.

1929

a 7-2 whipping of visiting Chicago. Rookie Steve Swetonic, who holds the
Cubs scoreless for 7 frames, is the winner.

Detroit's George Uhle notches his 9th consecutive win of the year, beating the
Browns, 7-6. McManus has 3 hits, including a HR and a double for the Tigers.

1930
The Cubs scheduled game with the Reds is postponed due to the sudden death
of Chicago pitcher Hal Carlson.

1932
The Red Sox split a pair with the visiting A's, winning 6-4 before losing
3-0. It is the Sox' last Sunday game at Braves Field. With the lifting of
the ban against playing Sunday ball at Fenway (because of a nearby church),
the Sox will play a Sunday game there on July 3.

1934
The Yankees purchase - some would say rent - spitballer Burleigh Grimes
from the Pittsburgh Pirates. After 10 appearances with the Yankees, the
Yanks will release Grimes and the Pirates will reobtain him.

At St. Louis, Ray Pepper has five hits, including 2 homers, and drives
in five runs to lead the Browns to a 12-7 win over Detroit. Pepper will
knock in 101 runs this year, but his career total will be just 170 RBIs;
he is the only player in history to have a 100-RBI season without reaching
200 for his career. Four other homers are hit today - two by Detroit -
but George Blaeholder goes the distance for the win.

1936
In the 2nd 15-0 shutout in a week, New York's Al Smith is the beneficiary
of the hitting as he closes down the Braves. Smith will toss 4 shutouts
this year, tops in the NL. Smith gives up a Texas Leaguer by Hal Lee in
the 8th and a ground single in the 9th.

On tour in the US, Japan's Waseda University loses to the University of
Chicago, 18-16, as the 2 teams combine for 34 hits and 17 errors. Waseda
scores 9 in the top of the 9th and Chicago answers with 5. Waseda will win
tomorrow's rematch, 10-5, as pitcher Wakahara allows 10 hits but strikes
out 17.

1937
In a Class A Western League game between the Des Moines Demons and the
Cedar Rapids Raiders, both teams wear polo helmets as head protectors.

The Cubs get Claude Passeau from the Phillies for Kirby Higbe, Joe Marty,

1941
The Cards nip the Reds 10-9 for their 10th straight win. The last five are one
run victories. The Reds almost pull the game out, scoring 3 in the 9th, but
Marty Marion snags a Ernie Lombardi line drive and doubles up Ernie Koy at 2B.

Ted Williams is 3 for 5 and scores a pair in the Red Sox' 6-4 win over the
A's. Ted will score 2 or more runs for the next 7 games giving him 8 in a row.

2-2 in a game called after 5 innings. DiMaggio has a hit and a strikeout,
just his 3rd this year.

1942

in baseball, bangs out 4 hits in pitching a 4-hit 16-1 victory over
Washington. They are his last ML hits. Buddy Hassett adds 4 hits as well.

1946

the American Giants in his debut with the Negro American League team.

Boo Ferriss shuts out the A's, 2-0, as the Boston Red Sox start another
win streak.

1948
Richie Ashburn hits his 1st ML homer, a leadoff inside-the-park HR, off
Thornton Lee's 3rd pitch. It runs Ashburn's hit streak to 18 games but it's
the Phils' only run, as the Giants win, 7-1. Bill Rigney leads off the 1st,
3rd and 5th innings with hits, while Sid Gordon adds a three-run homer in
the 5th. Lee is a complete-game winner over another ex-AL hurler, Walt Dubiel.

1949
After 44 games and 285 errorless chances, 2B Red Schoendienst of the
Cardinals errs twice against the Pirates. His last E was September 15,
1948. Elmer Riddle wins, 4-2, over the Cards' Harry Brecheen.

1950

the summer.

1951
The Indians sign high school star Billy Joe Davidson for a reported $150,000,
eclipsing the $100,000 the Pirates paid to Paul Pettit in 1949. Several
teams sought the services of the tall lefty, alleged to be the best Indians
prospect since Bob Feller. The Marion, North Carolina native will never
play a game in the majors.

Indians hurler Bob Lemon one-hits the Tigers, 2-1. The only Bengal hit is
Vic Wertz' HR.

1952
Boston's Maury McDermott faces 27 batters and fires a one-hitter to beat
the visiting Senators, 1-0. Mel Hoderlein's 4th inning single is the only
hit and he is erased on the basepaths. Maury walks one batter who is also
doubled up. The Senators leave no runners on base today and combined with
2 they left on base on the 27th set a new ML low for fewest left on base
in two consectuve games. It will be matched in both leagues.

The Giants' Willie Mays enters the army. Although Mays is hitting just .236,
the Giants are 2 1/2 games in first place. They will lose 8 of their next 10
games. Meanwhile, the Giants lose another young Birmingham player as Braves
scout Dewey Griggs signs Henry Aaron to a contract. The Indianapolis Clowns
receive telegram offers from both clubs, and Aaron, thinking he'll have a
better chance to make the team, prefers the Braves.

1953
3B Bob Elliott lines a double in the Browns' 6-run 11th inning, as they

and PH Slaughter. Wilmer's brother Bobby Shantz is the loser.

1956
In a 10-1 loss to the Dodgers at Forbes Field, Dale Long is held hitless
by Don Newcombe ending his consecutive-game homerun streak. The Pirates'
first baseman had established a new major league mark by homering in the
last eight Pittsburgh contests. Newk has a 3-run double off Kline in the
2nd to help clinch his 7th win.

For the second time in two years, Gus Bell of the Redlegs hits 3 homers -
all consecutive - going 5 for 5 in a 10-4 win over the Cubs at Wrigley. Bell
drives in 7 runs. Brooks Lawrence coasts to his 6th straight win.

1959
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his White House staff attend a game. He
gets slugger Harmon Killebrew's autograph on a HR ball for his grandson David,
as Washington defeats the Red Sox 7-6. The Killer will bang 15 homers in May.

and a double against the Braves at Wrigley Field. Three teammates hit HRs,
but the Cubs lose to the Braves, 11-9. Samuel hits his 1st ML HR, and Torre
and Adcock also connect. The Cubs outhit the Braves, 15-8, but a Rodgers
error in the 3rd opens the way for 6 unearned runs.

so badly he retreats to 2B only to find Nettles there. Gaetti tags Murcer
who is standing safely alone on the base, and then throws to Hrbek to catch
Nettles heading back to 1B. Murcer then tries for 3B and Hrbek's throw to

The longest and slowest game in American League history ends in the 25th
inning when Harold Baines homers off Chuck Porter to give the White Sox a
7-6 victory over the Brewers. It is the latest homer in history. The game
falls one inning shy of the ML record, but takes by far the most time to
play ... eight-hours six-minutes. The contest was suspended yesterday after
17 innings with the score tied 3-3, and each team scores three more runs in
the 21st. The Sox lose a chance to win in the 21st as runner Dave Stegman
is touched by 3B coach Jim Leyland, which leads to a Sox protest. Tom Seaver

with various bodies for 2 months before renting Mike Bordick from the O's.

The Yankees defeat the A's Olivares at Yankee Stadium, 4-1, on Andy Pettitte's
2-hitter. In the 6th inning, Oakland 2B Randy Velarde turns an unassisted
triple play, just the 11th in history, on a line drive by Shane Spencer. With
runners on 1st and 2nd running with the pitch, Velarde tags Jorge Posada
as he nears 2B, then touches the bag to retire Tino Martinez. In 1995,
while with the Yankees, Velarde turned an unassisted triple play against
the Dodgers in spring training following the strike.

2001
The Diamondbacks defeat the Giants, 1-0 in 18 innings with the game lasting
five-hours 53-minutes. Erubial Durazo throws out a runner at home in the
17th, then drives in Steve Finley with a double in the 18th. The loss goes
to Ryan Vogelsong, making his ML debut. Vogelsong almost redeems himself
with a double in his first ML at-bat in the 18th. The 2 teams combine for
139 plate appearances and their 14 pitchers throw a total of 503 pitches
(301 strikes and 202 balls). The game establishes franchise marks for
Colorado in both innings played and time.

2002
Yankee fireballer Roger Clemens becomes the third major leaguer to strike
out 10 or more batters in at least 100 games. Nolan Ryan (215) and Randy
Johnson (175) are the other two hurlers to have accomplish the feat.

In an article in Sports Illustrated magazine, former NL MVP Ken Caminiti
says that about 50 percent of current ML players use some form of steroids.

25-year-old minor leaguer Joe Bauldree dies in his sleep. The former Atlanta
farmhand, a pitcher for the Indy Allentown Ambassadors, had a history of
an irregular heart beat.

2003
The Rockies outscore the visiting Dodgers, 12-5, behind Todd Helton's 3
homeruns and Ron Belliard's 5 hits. Helton adds a single as he bats in
six runs.

The Red Sox, in need of a closer, trade all-star 3B Shea Hillenbrand
(.303, 3, 38) to the Diamondbacks for 24-year-old closer Byung Hyun
Kim. The Diamondbacks were reportedly not eager to swap the 24-year-old
South Korean. Hillenbrand was almost traded last winter to the Expos for
Bartolo Colon.

2010
The Giants call up Buster Posey to start at first base, and the 23-year-old
rookie responds going three for four with three RBIs in a 12-1 rout of the
Diamondbacks at AT&T Park. The Leesburg, GA native, who will be selected as
the National League's Rookie of the Year at the end of the season, will not
become the team's starting catcher until Bengie Molina is traded to Texas
at the end of June.

Kendry Morales breaks his left ankle jumping on home plate while celebrating
his walk-off grand slam that just beat Seattle, 9-7. The freak injury will
cause the 26-year-old talented Angel first baseman to probably miss the
rest of the season.

Roy Halladay throws the 20th perfect game in major league history, outdueling
Josh Johnson in the Phillies' 1-0 victory over the Marlins at Miami's Sun
Life Stadium. The former American League Cy Young Award winner, obtained

in franchise history to accomplish the feat.

2014
In the Blue Jays' 8-6 loss to Kansas City at the Rogers Centre, Edwin
Encarnacion hits a pair of two-run homers, both off Royals right-hander
James Shields, to set a franchise record for homeruns in a month with
16. The Toronto first baseman now also shares the American League mark for
most homeruns in the month of May with Yankees legend Mickey Mantle.

2016
United States softball star Jennie Finch becomes the first woman to manage
a pro baseball team when she leads the Bridgeport Bluefish to a 3-1 win
over the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in an Atlantic League contest played
at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard. The Olympic gold medal winning pitcher,
an All-American at Arizona, is married to Casey Daigle, who pitched briefly
for the Diamondbacks and Astros.
