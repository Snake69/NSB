May 7

1902
Elmer Flick signs with Cleveland. Sporting Life says that A's officials
"presumably consented" to the move. The presumption is cash.

The Cubs Jack Taylor beats Christy Mathewson 4-0 at Chicago's West Side
Grounds. Taylor gives up just 2 hits while Matty allows five. Following
a Giants' protest tomorrow that Taylor was pitching from in front of the
rubber, this game will later be ruled invalid and all the records will be
thrown out, including Taylor's win and Matty's loss.

1903
In the first game of what will become one of baseball's fiercest rivalries,
the Pilgrims' beat the Highlanders at Boston's Huntington Avenue Grounds,
6-2. The teams will change their names, but the intense competition between
the Red Sox and Yankees will become legendary.

At the Polo Grounds, Giants 1B Dan McGann steals four bases to lead New York
to an 8-4 win over the Phillies. Mathewson beats the Phils for the 2nd time
in a week, scattering 9 hits. Teammate Iron Joe McGinnity, a bench spectator,
is tossed in the 8th inning by umpire August Moran for mouthing off too much.

For the 2nd time in his career, Fred Clarke hits for the cycle and adds a
walk, sacrifice and stolen base, but the effort comes up short as the Reds
beat the Pirates, 10-8. The Pirates also lose Honus Wagner after a play
at 2B with Reds infielder Jack Morrissey. When Wagner threatens to punch
Morrissey, umpire Bug Holliday restrains him and the two clinch. Wagner is
suspended for 3 games.

1904
In St, Louis, the first-place Giants provoke a protest in winning 2-1, with a
pair of runs in the 9th off starter Jack Taylor. John McGraw, pinch running
after a single by Jack Warner, scores on a single by Roger Bresnahan. As
McGraw rounded 3B, with 1B coach Gilbert following him, the entire Giant team
collects along the 3B line yelling, St. Louis 1B Jake Beckley complains to the
ump about it and, when one of the Giants dashes to home from the coach's box,
Beckley fires to an uncovered home plate, thinking it is Bresnahan trying
to score. Which he then does for the win. St. Louis manager Kid Nichols
protests the game, claiming correctly, that the players left the bench in
violation of rule 56, section 17. The rule states:  "if one or more members
of the team at-bat stand or collect around a base for which a base runner is
trying, thereby confusing the fielding side and adding to the difficulty of
making such play, the base runner shall be declared out for the interference
of his teammate or teammates." NL president Pulliam rejects the complaint
and many fans and writers agree, saying the protest is unmanly, as noted
by historian Benton Stark (The Year They Called off the World Series).

1906
During the New York Americans' 7-2 win over visiting Washington, umpire Tim
Hurst strikes New York manager Clark Griffith in the mouth after Griffith
accidently steps on his shoe during a 10-minute argument following a close
play in the 5th inning. Griffith is tossed today but Hurst will be suspended
for 5 days.

The Cubs win their 10th straight topping the Pirates, 3-2, and move into
first place in the NL as the Giants drop to 2nd. The Giants get shut out
at Washington Park by Brooklyn's Jim Pastorious, 6-0. Harry Lumley cracks a
long drive near the CF fence for a triple and "Hoboken" Tim Jordan follows
with his first ML homer, off Hooks Wiltse. Jordan will lead the NL in
homers this year with Lumley second. John McGraw, sore from a car accident
yesterday that occurred while returning from an exhibition game in Newburgh,
watches the game from a box seat.

Detroit Tigers P Bill Donovan steals second, third and - on the front end of
a double steal - takes home, all in the 5th inning of an 8-3 victory over
Cleveland. He also slugs a triple. Donovan swiped home against Cleveland
last year as well. He is one of just 2 pitchers (Red Faber, 1915) who will
swipe 2B, 3B and home in a game.

Boston (NL) acquires P Gus Dorner from the Reds for P Chick Fraser.

1907
The Phillies' Frank Corridon pitches a 10-inning one-hitter to beat Boston's
Cy Young, 3-1. Corridon's triple in the 10th drives in 2 runs to win. The
only hit Corridon allows is a 4th inning single to Frank Burke.

1911
Cobb goes 4 for 5 and drives in the tying and winning runs to help Detroit
beat lefty Doc White and the Chicago White Sox, 5-4.

1913
New York's Ray Keating tosses a one-hitter against the Tigers, allowing just
a 2nd inning single to Chas Deal. Cobb strikes out his first two times up,
then calls it quits for the day. The Yankees win 6-0.

Mathewson relieves Red Ames in the 2nd inning with New York ahead, 3-1,
and the bases full of Reds. Matty shuts down Cincy and rolls to a 6-4 win
over Rube Benton.

1914

the Pirates a 1-0 win. The Cubs will lose ten 1-0 decisions this year,
tying the ML record.

1917
Red Sox P Babe Ruth allows just 2 singles in outpitching Washington's
Walter Johnson. Ruth knocks in the only run with an 8th inning sacrifice
fly. Ruth strikes out 3, while Johnson fans 7 and gives up 4 hits. It is
the 3rd time that Johnson has lost to Ruth by a 1-0 score. Ruth is now 6-0
with six complete games.

1918
In Washington, Babe Ruth hits his 3rd homer in three games, a tremendous
blast over the RF wall, to account for all of the Red Sox scoring in a 7-2
loss to Walter Johnson. It is the first homer in Griffith Stadium this year,
and the 6th ever over the barrier (Eddie Murphy reportedly hit the 1st,
which hit the top and bounded over), and earns Babe a big ovation. For Ruth,
it is the first of 10 homers he'll hit off Walter Johnson. Ruth plays first
base today for the 2nd game in a row and will be in the outfield for the
first time in his career on May 10th.

Former Dodger Pat Ragan coasts to a 16-0 win over the Dodgers as the Braves
pile up 17 hits. John Rawlings is 5 for 5. Ragan fans Jimmy Hickman 4
times. Zack Wheat, a hold out until April 30, makes his first appearance
in the Brooklyn lineup.

1921
Bob Meusel of the Yankees hits for the cycle. He hits a 2-run third-inning
HR off Walter Johnson and his triple with 2 on beats the Senators, 6-5, in
the 9th. Ruth strikes out 3 times against Johnson, then poles a HR in the
8th that lands in a tree outside of right field. Former President Wilson
witnesses the exciting game in Washington.

1922
Giants righthander Jesse Barnes walks Cy Williams in the 5th to spoil a 6-0
perfect game over the Phils. Williams is erased on a DP and Barnes faces
just 27 batters in the no-hitter. Lee Meadows takes the loss.

Pirates rookie Walter Mueller hits a HR on the first ML pitch he sees,
and it comes from Grover Alexander. Mueller is the first to accomplish
this feat. The boxscore credits the HR to teammate Ray Rohwer. In 4 years
Mueller will hit one more HR. Alexander exits in the 2nd inning and the
Pirates win, 11-5.

Cobb responsible for killing fan with a homerun! In the 7th inning of a game
in Detroit, Cobb connects off Chicago's Red Faber. During the excitement
after the hit, 65-year-old fan Alfred Kenning drops dead in the stands
cheering for the Tigers' player-manager. Despite serving up the homer,
Faber hangs on for a 9-7 win.

1923
In an 8-4 win over Chicago, Tigers 3B Bob Jones ties an AL record with 9
assists. Willie Kamm will match it for the White Sox on September 30th.

Brooklyn edges the Boston Braves, 12-11, although Phil Weinhart and Casey
Stengel are not around for the finish, as both are ejected for fighting.

1925
At Pittsburgh, the Pirates SS Glenn Wright pulls off a unassisted triple
play at 2B in the 9th grabbing Jim Bottomley's liner, stepping on the bag
before Johnny Cooney can get back and tagging Hornsby coming down from
1B. But the Cards still win 10-9 after scoring 6 runs in the 8th.

1928
Trailing the Browns 15-1, the Senators let reliever Clay Van Alstyne bat
in the 9th inning, Clay had earlier scored the only Nats run and responds
with his first ML homerun, a solo shot. It is also his last homerun and
his last at-bat.

1929
Yankee southpaw Tom Zachary wins a 6-5 game in relief at St. Louis, the
first of his 12 wins without a loss for the year, a ML record. No pitcher
will have a better season without losing a game. His batterymate, rookie
Bill Dickey, helps out with his first major league homer, off General Crowder.

1930
George Watkins scores 5 runs and Chick Hafey has 5 RBI in the 5th inning
as the Cards beat the Phils 16-11 to move out of the cellar and begin the
climb to an eventual pennant. Pete Alexander makes his first appearance
against his old mates and is hit hard. The loss drops the Phils to last
place, while the Cards head the other way.

The Cubs beat the Dodgers, 9-5, at Wrigley Field behind the 9-strikeout
pitching of Charlie Root. Root gives up successive homers to Wright and Del
Bissonette early and then the only run after that is a Bissonette ground
ball down the RF line that bounces into the stands for a HR.

The Red Sox edge the visiting White Sox, 6-4, behind the hitting of rookie
Tom Oliver, who has 4 hits. Oliver has now hit in 16 straight games.

Ray Kolp.

1932
Giant stars Carl Hubbell and Hal Schumacher toss back-to-back shutouts over
the Reds. King Carl wins a 1-0 squeaker and Prince Hal follows with a 3-0 win.

A rare dual league doubleheader takes place at Forbes Field. In the first
game the Pirates play the Phillies, losing 5-3. In the nitecap, the local
Negro League Homestead Grays take on the Philadelphia Hilldales.

1933
Reds SS Leo Durocher and Cardinals P Paul Derringer (0-2 this season)
are the principals in a trade that gives St. Louis a player to replace
Charley Gelbert, the victim of a hunting accident in November. Dutch Henry
and Jack Ogden also move from the Reds to St. Louis while Spark Adams and
Allyn Stuart go to Cincinnati. The pickup is a good one for the Reds, as
Derringer will fire four 20-win seasons for Cincy. This year he'll go 7-25
with the Reds, however.

1934
In Boston, Schoolboy Rowe wins for Detroit with 5 innings of relief, as

1940
The Dodgers are drubbed by the Cardinals, 18-2, when St. Louis totals 49
bases on 20 hits. The Cards have 13 extra base hits, 7 of them HRs to set
a NL mark for extra bases on long hits (29). Eddie Lake and Johnny Mize
each have a pair. Brooklyn then becomes the first NL team to fly, going
from St. Louis to Chicago on two planes. The Red Sox flew the same route
July 30, 1936, but for reasons of cost and risk, no other teams try the
airlines. The Dodgers will fly from New York from Chicago.

1941
At Philadelphia, Cubs pitcher Bill Lee cracks a pair of homers while pitching
Chicago to an 11-2 win over the Phils. Bill Crouch takes the loss.

At the Polo Grounds, Reds SS Eddie Joost accepts a record 19 chances as
Cincinnati edges New York, 1-0. In addition to his 10 assists and 9 putouts,
Joost has a throwing error and the game's only stolen base. Ernie Lombardi's
homer accounts for the only run as Bucky Walters is the winner over Prince
Hal Schumacher in a battle of veterans. Both pitchers keep the ball down
and each outfield accounts for a single flyout, tying the ML mark for fewest
chances by 2 teams.

The Pirates send veteran Lloyd Waner to the Braves, where he will be reunited
with his brother, in exchange for P Nick Strincevich. Waner will play just a

has a triple and 3 singles to drive in 4 runs.

In Washington, the Senators double the Indians, 10-5, overcoming two homeruns
by Tribe rookie Al Rosen, his 1st two in the ML. Connie Marrero serves up
the homers. Washington wins in the 7th on Gil Coan's grand slam off Bob Lemon
hit into the new LF stands at Griffith Stadium. The temporary stands in left
and left-center were put up to take advantage of the Senators' new power
hitters, but they will come down in two days. Coan is the only Nat to reach
the stands but nine visitors hit homers there prompting the take down. The
stands hold 854 customers but no one sits there while the stands are up.

1954
At New York, Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra crash back-to-back homers in the

Behind Carl Erskine, the Dodgers beat Robin Roberts and the Phils, 6-3,
for their 9th straight win. All the Phils scoring is on solo homers -
two by Jones and one by Ennis. For the Phils, it is their 8th loss in a
row while the Brooks have now won 20 out of 22 games. The game is almost
forfeited in the 7th after plate ump Art Gore chases Roberts, Earl Torgeson
and Jack Meyer from the Phils bench. Fans rain dozens of beer cans down on

line drive. Score, with a broken nose and lacerations, is carried off the
field on a stretcher. Lemon relieves and wins the game, 2-1. McDougald vows
to quit if Score is blinded as a result. Score regains his 20/20 vision,
but will miss the remainder of the 1957 season. Score, the 1955 Rookie of the
Year, who won 20 games in his sophomore season last year, never regains his
winning form, although the southpaw will blame a torn tendon in his pitching
arm, and not the horrific accident on the mound for his lack of achievement.

Vic Power becomes the first modern major leaguer to hit both a leadoff and
walkoff homerun in the same game. The A's first baseman, who went deep off

Haddix, highlights a six-run rally as the Giants edge the Pirates, 6-5,
in Candlestick Park. San Francisco ties a ML record and sets a NL record
by leaving just two men on base in two consecutive games (16 innings),
while winning both. The three runs tie for the most Haddix will ever give
up on a homerun. Among the 240 homers he surrenders during his career,
Haddix will not give up a grand slam, a NL record. Jim Palmer holds both
the major league and American League records in this category.
