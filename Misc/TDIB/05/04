May 4

1901
Fire destroys the wooden grandstand at League Park in St. Louis and halts the
game between St. Louis and Cincinnati with a 4-4 tie in the 10th inning. The
6,000 fans, a third in the 35 cent grand stands beat a leisurely retreat. The
city refuses to permit a duplicate park to be reconstructed, but wants a
steel or fireproof grandstand instead.

1902
The AL suspends John McGraw for 5 days for rowdyism on the field May 1st. To
show how evenhanded the AL is, Detroit catcher Fritz Buelow is suspended
for 5 days for the same reason. McGraw will use the time to go scouting.

is electrocuted when he touches a grandstand fence that had accidentally
been charged by an electrical wire.

1904
At Detroit, Cleveland starter John Hickey loads the bases in the 5th and is
lifted for Addie Joss, who gives up a bases-clearing triple. Addie holds the
Tigers scoreless after that, but the 3-2 loss - according to the ruling at
the time - goes to Joss [this loss will bounce back and forth between the
two pitchers].

innings. Henry Mathewson, Christy's brother, mops up in the 9th in his

time in three weeks that the Pirates have beaten Brown 1-0 in extra innings.

Christy Mathewson makes his first appearance of the year, giving up 9 hits,
4 walks and 3 runs in 7 innings against the Phillies. Philadelphia wins,
5-2, to complete a 3-game sweep of the cellar-dwelling Giants.

Washington. Tannehill allows 3 hits for the Senators.

President Taft takes in two games starting with the Reds and the Cardinals
at Robinson Field in St. Louis. The Cards score 5 in the 1st as Reds pitchers
Fred Beebe, Walt Slagle (in his only ML appearance) and Harry Coveleski will
eventually walk a record 16 in the 12-3 loss. The Cards walk 7 to total
a record 23. Taft doesn't stick around. He leaves for Sportsman's Park
in hopes of seeing some good baseball and is rewarded by a 3-3 14-inning
battle between the Browns' Joe Lake and the Naps' Cy Young that ends in
darkness. There will be a record 19 ties in the AL this year.

The first-place Tigers defeat the White Sox, 4-0, behind Pat Mullin. Mullin

Simmons who throws to SS Donie Bush.

1911
Staked to a 6-0 lead, Giants' ace Christy Mathewson coasts to a 7-2 win
against Boston.

1912
In New York the Giants rack up 9 stolen bases on catcher George Graham in
a 4-3 win over the Phils. Mathewson is the winner over Cliff Curtis. Matty
allows 5 hits, but his two base on balls score in the 8th when he serves
up a homer to Tom Downey. Phils 3B Hans Lobert, one of the fastest men in
the game, chases a foul ball into the stands and breaks his kneecap.

Down by 10 runs, the Cubs rally to pull within one run of the Pirates when
they score 6 runs in the 7th. Hank Robinson comes in to get a strikeout
to end the threat and pitches hitless ball for the final two frames as the
Pirates win, 12-11. Bobby Byrnes wins a suit of clothes by hitting the Bucs'
first homerun of the year at home, an inside-the-park line drive past Hofman.

1913
The U.S. League tries to compete as a ML, with teams in Baltimore, Brooklyn,
Philadelphia, Reading, New York, Newark, Washington and Lynchburg. They
will open May 10th and fold May 12th; Baltimore is the pennant winner with
a 2-0 record.

Pittsburgh's Babe Adams tosses a 2-hitter at the Reds and drives home the
game's only run with the Pirates' one hit of the game, a triple. Art Fromme
is the hard-luck loser for the Reds, 1-0.

At Chicago, the Cardinals beat the Cubs, 10-8, in 13 innings. The Cards run
out of pitchers and start the 9th with OF Ted Cather on the mound. He lasts
1/3 of an inning before 1B Ed Konetchy takes over. The Cubs score twice in
the 9th to tie it up, 8-8. Konetchy pitches 4 2/3 innings allowing 7 hits
and 4 walks but strikes out 3 to win his only ML game.

Ban Johnson indefinitely suspends Browns player-manager George Stovall for
an incident in the game on May 3 involving umpire Charlie Ferguson. Stovall
followed the ump off the field, grabbed his hat, threw it on the ground
and spat on it, all the time cursing out Ferguson. He then spat his
chewing tobacco in the face of the ump. Jimmy Austin will serve as interim
manager. Later this month Stovall will be relieved of his managerial duties
by Browns' owner Hedges.

1914
At the Polo Grounds, the Dodgers hit for the cycle against Mathewson in the
4th inning to take a 3-0 lead. Casey Stengel's double caps the scoring. But

in the 4th, and they go on to win, 4-3.

1916
Christy Mathewson, beset with back problems, makes his first start of
the year losing to the Braves, 7-6, in 10 innings. Matty goes the distance
allowing 15 hits, including a homer to rival pitcher Lefty Tyler. The Giants
were held in check by Tyler until the 9th when, trailing 4-0, they tie it
up. Fred Merkle's homer is the big blow in the inning.

Red Sox pitcher Dutch Leonard shuts out the Yankees, 3-0. The Yanks will
take the next three games to drop Boston below .500.

1918
At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees set a ML record (since tied) with 8
sacrifices, 6 coming on bunts, and nudge Boston 5-4. The bunting by New York
takes advantage of Boston lefty Babe Ruth, who is nursing a hangover. Babe
makes 2 errors and has 9 assists handling 13 fielding chances. Despite
contributing his first homer of the year, plus a double, Ruth loses to
Allan Russell. Boston's 1B Dick Hoblitzell injures his finger, and in the
next game Ruth will make his first career start as a position player.

May 10, 1917, breaks his losing streak with a 3-hit, 2-0, win over the
Phils. Prendergast takes the loss.

Walter Johnson, in relief of Harry Harper, loses to the A's Scott Perry,
1-0, in 11 innings. Johnson will appear in 15 extra-inning games this year,
nine as a starter and six in relief. He'll beat every club in extra frames
except the A's.

1919
A SRO crowd of more than 25,000 attends the first-ever major league game
played on a Sunday in Brooklyn. The Ebbets Field contest, in which the Dodgers
beat the Braves, 6-2, was made possible when the New York Legislature passed
the Sunday Baseball Bill into law.

The Giants play their first legal Sunday game at home, before 35,000 fans,
losing to the Phils 4-3. By early June, the Giants will outdraw their
1918 attendance. The Phillies' Dave Bancroft, 28, is carried off the field
after breaking his right ankle while sliding into a base. He will be out
of action until July 1, and next year he'll be traded to the Giants, with
whom he will have his best seasons enroute to the Hall of Fame.

The A's collect 18 hits, but lose to Washington, 12-6, leaving an

Ruether scores one of the Brooklyn runs when he steals home in the 5th
inning, the 2nd steal of home in his career.

Reds, will play one more with St. Louis, and finish his 5-game season and
14-year career.

homer to keep his batting streak going at 19 games, and also steals home
in the 8th inning.

1928
At Pittsburgh, the Boston Braves beat Ray Kremer and the Pirates, 5-4, in 11
innings. Kremer is matched by Ed Brandt who also goes 11 frames. For Kremer,
it is his first loss at home after 22 wins, a ML record for consecutive
wins at home that won't be matched in the 20th century.

1929
At Comiskey Park, Lou Gehrig wallops 3 homeruns against the Sox in an 11-9
New York shootout. His middle HR, in the 7th inning, is sandwiched between
roundtrippers by Ruth and Bob Meusel. With his homer off Red Faber in the
2nd, Gehrig joins Ruth as the 2nd slugger to clear the RF stands, 75 feet
high and 360 feet away from home plate. The Ruthian clout came off Tommy
Thomas in 1927. His last homer of the day is served up by Dan Dugan.

At the Baker Bowl, Cubs pitcher Pat Malone holds the Phillies scoreless,
and collects 3 singles and 2 RBI to win easily, 16-0. Hack Wilson and Kiki

in which Gehrig plays OF.

to reporters by bouncing it on his office carpet. This ball will prove to

previous ball in the first 72 games.

1944

the humiliating defeat is Phil Rizzuto's 3 hits.

1969
At the Astrodome, Houston sets a National League record and ties a ML

what is calculated as ML baseball's one-millionth run of all time (the
Philadelphia Nationals Wes Fisler scored the first run on April 22, 1876)
as Milt May hits John Montefusco's first pitch to drive him home. The Reds
Davey Concepcion homers about the same moment and races around the bases,
but Watson, on 2B, scores seconds ahead as the Reds lose to Atlanta, 3-2. On

2-out 2-run homer by Sammy Sosa, to card the victory. Sosa also hit a 2-out
3-run homer in the 9th, and has 5 hits for the game. The Rockies counter with

Grace hits a bases-loaded homer in the 3rd inning, relinquishing his title

6 runs in the 2nd off Maddux, which was the 1st time he's allowed 6 runs
in an inning. For McGwire, it is also his 100th HR with the Cardinals,
