May 20

1903
After beating the Pirates in a relief effort yesterday, Mathewson allows
6 hits in shutting out the defending NL champs, 2-0. Sam Leever takes the
loss. New York takes three games in the series and Mathewson wins them all.

Willie Sudhoff beats the Boston Americans, 4-3, but Boston stops the
St. Louis pitcher's three-game shutout skein.

1904
Chicago scores two in the 9th to beat Mathewson, 3-2, and knock the Giants
out of first place. For Matty, it is his 4th straight loss.

1905
The Reds purchase former Red Shad Barry from the Cubs.

1906
Arriving in Chicago in first place by percentage points, the Giants lose
the opener of the series, 10-4, to drop to 2nd place.

1907
A 17-game winning streak started by the Giants comes to an end in a 6-4
loss to St. Louis.

In the Highlanders' 4-1 win over Boston, Kid Elberfeld accounts for half
the total tallies with 2 steals of home, the first American Leaguer to
accomplish that feat.

1909
In New York, Honus Wagner is given a silver trophy for winning the 1908 NL
batting crown. The Giants then edge the Pirates, 2-1.

After 5 losses, Walter Johnson picks up his first win, outdueling Cleveland's
Addie Joss, 3-2. Johnson strikes out 10 and drives in the winning run.

1911
The A's outslug the Tigers to win 14-12, as Cobb goes 3 for 4 against the
winner Jack Coombs. Coombs, who will end up as the top winner in the AL for
the 2nd year in row, was the starter yesterday when the Tigers won. A Coombs
pitch in the 1st inning breaks the wrist of Tiger 1B Del Gainor (spelled
Gainer in the record books; Gainor in contemporary accounts) effectively
ending both the Tigers' chances this year and Gainor's promising career
(he'll play part-time through 1922). He is not expected to play for 6 weeks,
but that will stretch to September. His replacement, Jack Ness, starts a
3-6 triple play to Donie Bush.

A New England League game is called in the 7th inning because of dense fog
in Lynn, Massachusetts. Lynn is leading until Weaver of Fall River hits
a fly ball to the OF with a man on. The Lynn outfielders are unable to
locate the ball, and both runners score to go ahead 6-5. After a dispute,
umpire Walsh rules that the game has to revert to the 6th inning with Lynn
winning by a 5-4 score.

1913
The Yankees snag 22-year-old SS Roger Peckinpaugh from Cleveland, sending
in exchange Bill Stumpf and Jack Lelivelt. Peckinpaugh played in fewer than
100 games over 3 seasons, but will start in New York. The Yankees win today,
beating the Browns, 6-3, but St. Louis will shut out New York in the next
2 games.

The Phils beat the Reds, 5-1, behind Alexander. The only Cincy run comes
home on a boot by Fred Luderus.

St. Louis righty Bob Harmon shuts out the Giants on 2 hits to win, 8-0. The
Cards light up Mathewson for 11 hits and 4 runs in 6 innings.

The Tigers edge the A's, 8-7, with Ty Cobb stealing home for the 2nd time
in three days. His swipe comes in the 3rd inning.

1914
The first-place Pirates trip the Braves, 4-1, in a game that features the
debut of Dolf Luque, "The Pride of Havana," who will be a 1920s star for
the Reds.

1916
The Giants win their 10th on the road, when Christy Mathewson allows 6 hits
in clipping the Cardinals, 4-1. Henry Jasper is the losing pitcher. Fred
Merkle steals 3rd and home in the 2nd inning, the latter on the front end
of a double steal.

At Fenway, starter Babe Ruth walks the first two Browns hitters. With
the 2nd walk, Ruth's batterymate Chet "Pinch" Thomas complains so much
about the call that he is tossed, and Sam Agnew takes his place behind the
plate. After two outs, and runners at 1B and 3B, the Browns pull a double
steal to score. The Sox take a 2-1 lead after 4, and when Ruth walks the
bases loaded in the 6th, Carl Mays relieves. Mays allows 2 hits in 3 1/3
innings to preserve the 3-1 win. Ruth allows no hits in his 5 2/3 innings.

The Senators paste the Indians, 13-3. Shorty Desjardien mops up for Cleveland
in the 8th inning, allowing three runs on 3 walks and 2 hits in his only
major league appearance.

1917
Cleveland P Jim "Sarge" Bagby steals home in the 7th, and the Indians beat
the A's 5-2.

1918
In what will become a precursor of a tragic event, Indian outfielder Tris
Speaker is struck on the head by a pitch thrown by Red Sox hurler Carl
Mays. The submarine pitcher, who will fatally bean Ray Chapman with a pitch
in 1920 as a member of the Yankees, denies Speaker's allegation that the
pitch was intentional.

With 2 outs in the bottom of the 14th inning, the A's Merlin Kopp swipes
home with the game-winner as Philadelphia beats Detroit, 5-4. Kopp has 2
steals in the game, as well as a double and a triple. The A's Elmer Myers
and the Tigers' Hooks Dauss each go the distance as both teams score runs
in the 10th and 12th. Ty Cobb has three hits to run his consecutive game
hitting streak against the A's to 23 games (as noted by Trent McCotter)
matching his career mark set in 1912.

In a 5-2 loss at Cincinnati, Braves 3B Red Smith makes an out after 10
straight hits over 5 games, a Braves franchise record (since tied). He has
3 straight hits today before making an out.

1919
In the 2nd inning Red Sox southpaw Babe Ruthâ€¨hits the first of his 16
career grand slams. The bases-loaded homerun proves to be the difference
when Boston and the 'Bambino' beat the Browns at Sportsman's Park, 6-4,
with Ruth getting the win. Dave Davenport takes the loss.

1920
The Phils hit the cellar, having fallen from first in 17 days. They lose
6-4 to the Cards with Bert Gallia, in his first NL start after coming from
the Browns, taking the loss. Willie Sherdel, the 3rd St. Louis pitcher,
allows no base runners. With the season all but over, Phils manager Gavvy
Cravath will start fast-working pitcher Lee Meadows every Saturday at home,
so Cravath can get an early start to his weekend cottage.

Requested by Cubs officials, policemen disguised as soldiers, farmers and
bootblacks raid the Cubs bleachers and arrest 24 fans for gambling. Meanwhile,
Grover Alexander tops the Giants, 4-2, for his 8th straight win.

With the White Sox and Washington tied 3-3 at the end of 14, both teams
score twice in the 15th. Chicago then piles on with 8 runs in the 16th on
a double, 2 triples, 2 singles and 4 errors to beat Walter Johnson. The 8
runs is a ML record for the 16th.

Infielder Wilson Fewster reports to the Yankees. Fewster was beaned in
spring training and spent a month in a Baltimore hospital.

The Reds beat the Robins, 7-0, behind Ruether's six hitter. Brooklyn first
sacker Ed Konetchy has half the hit total with a single, double and triple,
while Reds Jake Daubert has 4 hits. It's not a complete loss for Brooklyn
as manager Wilbert Robinson announces that he has persuaded Tommy Griffith
to rejoin the team immediately. The right fielder retired after the 1919
season and has been working as a bond salesman in Cincinnati.

1922
Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel (and since-traded pitcher Bill Piercy), suspended
on October 16, 1921, by Judge Landis, are reinstated and return to the New
York lineup going hitless in New York's 8-2 loss to the rallying Browns at
the Polo Grounds. The Browns, down 2-0 after 7, score one in the 8th and 7
in the 9th, six of them coming after the game-ending out is called by ump
Ollie Chill at first base. Pitcher Sam Jones, taking the throw at 1B from
Wally Pipp, apparently makes the 3rd out and fans swarm the field. But Jones
does not hold onto the ball cleanly and plate ump Brick Owens instructs Chill
to make a safe call. The tying run scores on the play and, when the action
resumes 15 minutes later, Wally Gerber singles to make the score 3-2. Walks to
Sisler and Williams force home another run, and Baby Doll Jacobson clears the
bases with a grand slam into the RF stands to complete the scoring. Winner
Urban Shocker allows just three hits, including a two-run homer by second
baseman Aaron Ward. The loss to Jones starts him on a 10-game losing streak,
while a cold Ban Johnson will let umpire Ollie Chill go after the season.

The Indians, behind Tris Speaker's first grand slam, beat the Red Sox
5-2. The reinstated Bill Piercy is the losing pitcher.

1923
With the Polo Grounds newly expanded, the Giants set a NL attendance record
with 42,000+ fans on hand. The Giants clip the Cardinals, 14-4, on 20 hits.

Stanley Coveleski and the Indians beat Boston, 1-0. Coveleski makes 10
assists.

1925
Tris Speaker, scoring from first base on a single, plates the winning run
in the Indians' 10-9 walk-off win over the Yankees. The Tribe score six
times in the bottom of the ninth to accomplish the amazing comeback.

George Sisler's 34-game hitting streak, stretching back to Opening Day,
is stopped by the A's Lefty Grove and Slim Harriss. Browns teammate Ken
Williams bangs a grand slam, but the A's win, 8-6.

Casey Stengel buys the Worcester club in the Eastern League and arranges
for the Braves to send 7 players down to his club.

Chicago and Boston pitchers combine to walk 20 batters, as the White Sox
stroll to a 10-7 win.

1927
At Ebbets Field, the Cubs top the Dodgers, 7-5, behind Tony Kauffmann. Fans
interrupt the game with a shower of bottles after a disputed call by umpire
Pete McLaughlin. Babe Herman has a pair of homers for Brooklyn, but costs
his team 2 runs with an errant throw.

At Philadelphia, the Reds win the opener, 6-3, behind Pete Donohue's mastery
of the Phils. George Kelly provides a grand slam. The Phils roll to a 15-2
win in the nitecap as Cy Williams belts three HRs and a triple, collecting
6 RBIs and scoring 4 times. Williams ties Ruth and Gehrig for the ML lead
with 9 homers.

1931
At Philadelphia, the Phils outslug the Pirates, 11-7, with the victory
going to reliever Ben Shields, his last ML decision. The journeyman will
wrap up his undefeated career, finishing 4-0, despite an 8.27 ERA.

1932
Paul Waner ties the ML record with 4 doubles in 5 at-bats in the Pirates
5-0 win over the Cards. The future Hall of Fame outfielder will break Chuck
Klein's NL season doubles record with 62. Rip Collins' double in the 7th
is the first of only 2 hits off Larry French.

1934
In the second matchup of Dizzy Dean and Carl Hubbell, Diz comes out ahead
again, 9-5.

San Francisco (PCL) star Joe DiMaggio tears the cartilage in his left knee
exiting from a jitney taxi and will miss six weeks of action.

1935
Hank Greenberg collects 2 of his 3 RBIs in the 11th inning as Detroit tops
the A's, 8-6. A's pitcher George Caster, heeding the advice of Jimmie Foxx,
walks Gehringer in the last frame to pitch to Greenberg.

1936
The Giants take first place from the Cardinals, defeating them at the Polo
Grounds 10-7. Tomorrow Paul Dean will pitch the Cards back on top, as the
NL lead seesaws.

Veteran Fred Lindstrom, who abruptly quit the Dodgers and returned home to
Chicago, says he may return to play for Brooklyn next year if he's feeling
good. He doesn't.

1938
In a Saturday morning publicity stunt organized by the Come to Cleveland
Committee, five members of the Indians attempt to set a record by a catching a
baseball thrown from the top of 708-foot Terminal Tower. Twenty-four-year-old
rookie third string catcher Henry Helf, wearing his street clothes, catches
a ball dropped from the 52-story structure, estimated to be traveling at
the speed of 138 mph, to break Gabby Street's mark for a vertical catch
established when the Senator catcher snagged a sphere dropped 555 feet from
the top of the Washington Monument in 1908.

1940
Behind 7-1, the Phils score 7 runs in the 9th inning to edge the Pirates,
8-7. Morrie Arnovich, with a single his first time up in the 9th, walks
with the bases loaded to push across the winning run. Wally Berger's two
run single had tied the contest at 7-7.

Pinky Higgins clouts three successive homers and drives in seven runs to
lead Detroit to a 10-7 victory over the leading Red Sox at Detroit's Briggs
Stadium. The third baseman's first two clouts come off Lefty Grove, and the
last off Jack Wilson, who is charged with the loss. Jimmy Foxx hits his 10th
homer of the year, a 5th inning grand slam, and Lefty Grove homers in the 2nd.

The Yankees slip back into last place, losing to the Indians, 10-2. Al
Smith allows just 3 NY hits.

1941
OF Taft Wright of the Chicago White Sox doubles to drive in a run and sets
an AL record by driving in at least one run in 13 consecutive games. Wright
has 22 RBI in the streak, although in 6 of the games he knocked in a run
without a hit.

With the Phils down 4-0, the Phils' George Jumonville hits a pinch homer,
his only HR in the majors, and the Phils come back to top the Cards in 11
innings, 6-4. It is Jumonville's last ML at-bat.

At Crosley Field, the Reds score 6 runs in the 9th to defeat the Braves,
9-6. Frank McCormick finishes the scoring with a 3-run homer.

1942
Brooklyn's Whit Wyatt loses 1-0 to the Cards' Mort Cooper, the first loss
for Wyatt after 8 straight wins. Cooper allows just 2 hits. The Cards score
on Walker Cooper's triple and a fly ball in the 5th.

Rookie Ray Lamanno hits a grand slam in the 3rd, off Ike Pearson, in the

1943
With Charley Fuchs and Al Gerheauser pitching, the Phillies whitewash the
Cubs, 3-0 and 2-0.

1944
Mel Harder of the Indians and Paul Derringer of the Cubs both win their
201st career games. Derringer's win comes at home, 3-2, over Boston's
Nate Andrews. At Philadelphia, Harder wins his, 5-0, allowing 3 hits and
finishing in 1 hour 37 minutes. Cy Young is on hand to watch the game.

1945
In St. Louis, Pete Gray stars, as the Browns sweep the Yankees 10-1 and
5-2. The one-armed outfielder has 2 RBI on 3 hits in the opener, and in
the nightcap he scores the winning run and hauls in 7 fly balls, 3 on
spectacular catches.

Before 51,340 fans at the Polo Grounds, the Giants and Pirates split a
doubleheader. Bill Voiselle wins his 8th straight to give the Giants a 5-1
win in the opener. Medwick and Lombardi homer for New York. Preacher Roe
then shuts out the Giants in game 2. New York ends the day atop the NL by
3 1/2 games.

At Boston, the Reds build an 8-1 lead over the Braves behind the pitching
and hitting of Bucky Walters, who belts a pair of homers. Bucky then holds
on for a 10-8 win.

1946
Claude Passeau of the Chicago Cubs makes his first error since September 21,
1941, ending his streak with an all-time pitcher's fielding record of 273
consecutive errorless chances. Passeau set the mark using the small glove in
the NL. He received permission from the commissioner to use a modified glove
because the fingers on his left hand were affected by a gunshot wound incurred
as a youngster. He wins the game, however, beating Boston's Mort Cooper, 6-4.

A state Supreme Court justice has armed the Yankees with an injunction
against the raiding Mexican Leaguers, and the Dodgers and the Cardinals
have also turned to the courts for protection and damages. Before any of
the relief becomes permanent, however, Max Lanier, Fred Martin and Lou
Klein jump back to the Redbirds.

1947
In a game which features no extra-base hits, the Pirates defeat Boston at
Forbes Field, 4-3. The teams collect a total of 22 hits,â€¨all singles with
Pittsburgh collecting a dozen.

Athletics C Buddy Rosar drops a pop-up off Walt Judnich's bat for his first
error in 147 games and 756 chances. Yogi Berra will extend the record to
148 and 950 in 1957-59, but Rosar's 1946 single-season record of 115 games
and 605 errorless chances will not be surpassed until 1997, by the Marlins'
(NL) Charles Johnson. The Browns win, 11-1, behind Red Muncrief.

1948
In front of only 5,001 fans in Chicago, Joe DiMaggio hits for the cycle and
adds another homer to drive in six runs, as the Yanks coast, 13-2. DiMag
almost has a 6th extra base hit, but left fielder Ralph Hodgin snares it at
the wall. Johnny Lindell adds a homer to back Vic Raschi's pitching over
Orval Grove, who lasts 5 innings. DiMaggio is the first Yankee in eight
years to hit for the cycle. DiMag last cycled in 1937, when he also added
a 2nd homer. He's the only player to do that twice.

In a 13-4 Cleveland win, the Indians collect 18 bases on balls against the
Red Sox to tie the AL record. Handing out the free passes are two Mickeys -
Harris and McDermott (11 in 6 2/3 IP). Bob Lemon, Jim Hegan and Ken Keltner
all collect RBIs without the benefit of a hit.

Musial and the Cards continue slugging the Dodgers, winning 13-4, as "The
Man" has 4 hits, including a HR and 2 doubles. Musial is 11 for 15 in
the series. Enos Slaughter chips in three hits as Howie Pollet wins over
Joe Hatten.

The Pirates batter the Braves, 13-0, behind Elmer Riddle's 4-hitter. The
Bucs tally 8 runs in the 4th inning, with the scoring started by Ralph
Kiner's 9th HR of the season. He adds a double in the inning.

1950
The Dodgers move back into first place with a twinbill sweep of the visiting
Pirates, winning 3-2 and 4-3. Hodges doubles with the bases loaded in the
8th to provide the game 1 margin. In the nitecap, 3 Dodger relief hurlers
... Ralph Branca, Jack Banta and Dan Bankhead ... combine to pitch 9 2/3
innings of no-hit ball, as Brooklyn beats Pittsburgh 4-3 in 11 innings. Bill
Werle goes the distance for the Corsairs in the 2nd game.

The Tigers 2B Jerry Priddy starts a record 5 DPs in the first 5 innings
to lead the Tigers to a 5-3 win over the A's. Shortstop Johnny Lipon
participates in all the DPs to tie an AL mark.

The Giants sweep a pair from the Reds, 8-0 and 4-3, with Monte Kennedy
starting both games for New York. Durocher lifts Kennedy after one batter
in the opener, and Dave Koslo allows 2 hits the rest of the way. Kennedy
then goes the route in the nitecap, allowing 4 hits. Ken Heintzelman in
1941 was the last National Leaguer to start both games in one day.

1951
Before 42,088 at Wrigley, Dutch Leonard wins a pair, beating the Braves, 4-3
and 5-4. Dutch tosses two innings in each game as the Cubs beat Chet Nichols
and Vern Bickford. The Cubs are now a game back of the front-running Dodgers.

The Phils defeat the Pirates, 17-0 and 12-4, as Richie Ashburn gets 4 hits
in each game. Russ Meyer tosses the shutout in the first game pasting over
Murry Dickson.

1952
In his first start following his no-hitter, Detroit's Virgil Trucks and
Dick Littlefield combine to two-hit the Athletics, 5-1.

Playing center field and batting third, Mickey Mantle displays his
switch-hitting skills by collecting two singles from each side of the
plate. His first two hits are against righty Ken Holcombe, while the last
two come off lefty Chuck Stobbs. Johnny Sain scatters six White Sox hits
to win, 3-1.

1953
In just their thirteenth home game of the season, the Milwaukee Braves
attendance surpasses the entire total of 281,278 fans attending their 77
games in Boston last year. The team will set a National League record for
attendance as 1,826,397 patrons will pass through the turnstiles this season,
more than the last three years in Beantown.

Paced by Red Schoendienst's 6 RBIs, on a HR, 2 doubles and a single,
the Cards sink the Pirates 11-6. Solly Hemus scores 5 runs for the Birds,
as Joe Presko beats Bob Friend.

1956
The Pirates draw their biggest crowd in 5 years - 32,326 - and sweep a
pair from the Braves, 6-5 and 5-0. Dale Long hits a homer in each game and
drives in 7 runs. Friend wins the opener and Ron Kline fires a 6-hitter in
the nitecap.

1958
The Cardinals trade Alvin Dark to the Cubs in exchange for hurler Jim
Brosnan. Both players will be productive on their new teams during the
remainder of the season with 'Blackie' hitting .297 in 114 games for
Chicago, and the newest Redbirds' right-hander will compile an 8-4 record
for St. Louis.

In Chicago, New York coasts to a 5-1 win over the last-place Sox behind
the pitching of Johnny Kucks. Mantle's line drive between Al Smith and Jim
Rivera goes for his 2nd inside-the-park homer of the year. The Yankees have
now won 7 in a row. Mantle will hit three inside-the-park homers this year,
and a Yankee-record six during his career.

1959
The Yankees sink to last place, the first time since May 25, 1940, as Detroit
drubs them 13-6. Fittingly, it is Yankee Killer Frank Lary who wins it,
improving his lifetime record against New York to 18-5.

1960
At Comiskey Park, Ted Kluszewski drives in 4 runs to lead the White Sox to
a 5-3 win, the 9th in a row at home for Chicago. Mantle hits a 2-run homer
in the 9th inning off Early Wynn, the winner. Chicago leads Cleveland in
the AL by 1 1/2 games.

The Pirates stretch their NL lead to 1 1/2 games by edging the Giants,
5-4, on Roberto Clemente's single in the 12th inning. Clemente has 3 hits
to raise his average to .378. Willie McCovey's homer in the 9th tied it
for San Francisco, and a score in the 12th put them ahead. But Don Hoak's
single and a run-scoring double by Dick Groat sets the stage for Clemente.

Love that home cooking. The Cards, 2-17 on the road, win their 10th in
13 decisions at home, beating the Reds and starter Jim O'Toole, 6-1. With
the bases loaded, Stan Musial hits a line drive back at Cincy reliever Joe
Nuxhall, who deliberately drops the ball in order to start a DP. The umps
rule Nuxhall did it on purpose and Musial is out. The runners return to
their bases. Jackson is the winner.

1961
Ed Bouchee hits a game-ending homer in the 9th to break up a scoreless
pitching duel between the Cubs' Dick Ellsworth and the Cardinals' Larry
Jackson. The Cubs win 1-0 at Wrigley, their 2nd 1-0 win in a row. Bouchee
also ties a ML fielding record when he handles 22 chances at 1B; 19 PO and
3 assists. Ellsworth allows 3 hits and throws 101 pitches.

1962
The Indians tie the ML record for most HRs in 6 straight games - 21 - set
by the Giants in July of 1954. They win the first game over Detroit 7-6,
then lose 8-6 in the nitecap.

At Connie Mack Stadium in Philadelphia, the Cubs sweep a doubleheader,
winning 6-4 and 11-2 behind the hitting of young Lou Brock and rookie 2B
Ken Hubbs. Brock's 2nd inning grand slam is the difference in game one,
while Hubbs collects 8 singles on the afternoon, 3 for 3 in the first game
and 5 for 5 in game 2. The Chicago second baseman will be selected as the
Rookie of the Year.

1964
Led by Johnny Callison's 5 for 5, the Phillies snap Juan Marichal's 12-game
win streak and beat the Giants in San Francisco, 7-2.

1967
At Wrigley, the Cubs pound Los Angeles, 20-3, to give Ken Holtzman (5-0)
a win before he leaves tomorrow for a 6-month tour of duty in the Army. The
hitting stars are Adolpho Phillips with 6 RBI, Randy Hundley with a grand
slam, and Glenn Beckert with a double and an inside-the-park HR. Rounding
out the scoring is Ted Savage's steal of home. In the Dodger dugout in 7th
inning, Don Drysdale waves a white handkerchief of surrender. Holtzman will
pitch on weekend passes and tack on another 4 wins without a loss.

At Tiger Stadium, Denny McLain beats the Yankees, 3-1. New York's only score
is a tremendous homer by Mickey Mantle into the deep seats in right center.

Mets reliever Jack Hamilton hits his only ML homer, a grand slam off Al
Jackson, but it is not enough as the Cardinals win, 11-9.

1968
For the second time in his career and the second time in franchise history,
Jim Fregosi hits for the cycle in the Angels' 5-4 11-inning victory over
Boston at Anaheim Stadium. The California shortstop became the first player
to accomplish the feat for the club in 1964.

1969
At Los Angeles, the Cubs beat the Dodgers and Don Sutton, 7-0. Ken Holtzman
is the winner for the second time in two weeks. Chicago hands Sutton his
12th loss in a row against them.

1970
Rod Carew hits for the cycle to lead the Twins to a 10-5 win over host Kansas
City. Carew is the first Twin to cycle. Three other Twins homer as well.

1972
Bobby Valentine homers on the first pitch of the game and Al Downing shuts
out Houston on 2 hits to give the Dodgers a 3-0 win. The game takes just
1 hour 30 minutes - a LA club record - and moves Los Angeles into 1st place.

1973
In a 5-player deal, Angels 1B Jim Spencer and Rangers 1B Mike Epstein
switch teams.

1975
The Indians trade pitchers Dick Bosman and Jim Perry to the A's for P Blue
Moon Odom and cash.

1976
At New York, Carl Yastrzemski clubs 2 homers, giving him 5 in two games,
to tie a ML mark. Boston wins, 8-2. Boston P Bill Lee injures his arm in a
fight with Yankee players, ending up on the bottom of a pile of players. Lee
never really recovers from the injury although he will win 16 games with the
Expos in 1979. The fight starts when Lou Piniella, running on Dwight Evans,
is gunned down at the plate and barrels into Fisk. Both come up swinging and
both benches clear. Lee then blames Martin for espousing a fighting style
that brought the brawl on. In 2006, Lee gives an interview to the Marin
Independent Journal where he recounts how the Red Sox treated his injury
"They're going, 'Here take this, take this, take this.' Afterwards I've
got sterazolidin, butazolidin, Clenerol, Indicin. I've got everything in
me. I can pitch in the American League, but I couldn't run in the Kentucky
Derby. Holy cow, I'm glowing in the dark."

1977
Eight homers, 4 by each team, are hit in the Brewers 15-7 win over the Red
Sox. Jerry Augustine goes the distance for his 5th win.

1978
In a 6-0 victory over Montreal, Willie Stargell hits the longest home run in
the history of Olympic Stadium. The Pirate first baseman's 535-foot blast,
hit off Expo right-hander Wayne Twitchell, is his 407th round-tripper,
tying him with Duke Snider for career homers.

1979
Houston moves to 1 1/2 games in back of the Reds with a doubleheader sweep
of San Diego. In game 1, Terry Puhl hits a leadoff homer, off Gaylord Perry,
for the only score in the game. Williams is the winner. Houston takes the
nitecap, 6-3.

1981
At Wrigley, Reds reliever Doug Bair does it himself, hitting a 3-run homer
in the 9th inning to beat the Cubs, 10-7. The homer, off Dick Tidrow,
is Bair's only ML dinger.

1983
In a 5-0 loss to San Diego, Phillies southpaw Steve Carlton whiffs four
batters to move past Walter Johnson into second place (3,511) on the
career all-time strikeout list. 'Lefty', ten K's behind leader Nolan Ryan
(who broke Johnson's record earlier this season), will finish the season
in front of the Astros' right-hander as the all-time career leader with 3,709.

1984
Boston's Roger Clemens strikes out 7 batters in 7 innings enroute to his
first ML victory, 5-4 over the Twins.

1985
The Indians-Brewers game at Cleveland Stadium becomes the first one rained
out this season, ending a record string of 458 ML games played since Opening
Day without a payoff on a rain check. Since 1900, no season had survived
without at least one April shower.

Kevin Stock and Bob Loscaizo of Modesto (California League) both hit for
the cycle in their team's 23-4 win over Visalia.

1986
Milwaukee falls behind 8-0 in the top of the first inning. But they storm
back to defeat Cleveland 12-9.

1987
In a season of streaks, the Brewers end a 12-game losing streak by beating
the Chicago White Sox, 5-1. The Brew Crew had opened the season winning 13
consecutive games.

1988
Mike Schmidt hits his 535th career homerun to move past Jimmie Foxx into
8th place on the all-time list, but the Phillies lose to San Diego 4-3.

1990
Ahead 10-4 after two innings, the Braves hold on for a 13-11 win over the
visiting Pirates. Ron Gant and Dale Murphy each slug a pair of homers for
Atlanta, while Bobby Bonilla hits two homers and scores 5 runs for the
Bucs. It is only the 3rd time in history a player has scored 5 runs for a
losing team. Barry Bonds adds a homer.

1992
North Carolina Little League coach Richard Blackwell is arrested after
slashing the throat of a rival coach during an argument over a game of a
few days earlier. On June 8, Blackwell will be banned from participating in
Little League for 2 years, but will not be given jail time after pleading
guilty to a reduced sentence.

1993
14-year-old Tommy McCoy, batboy for the Class A Savannah Cardinals, is fired
by the team after the club was told by the US Department of Labor that they
were in violation of child labor laws. McCoy, apparently, was staying out
too late doing his job. When US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich hears the
story, however, he exempts batboys and bat girls from the law. McCoy will
be reinstated on May 27th.

1994
Minnesota OF Kirby Puckett's 7 RBIs leads the Twins to a 21-2 victory over
the Red Sox. Minnesota scores 11 times in the 5th inning to put the game
away. Rookie OF Andy Tomberlin hurls the last 2 innings for the Sox, and
allows just 1 hit and no runs.

The Mariners fall just short of matching the Twins by defeating the Rangers
by a score of 19-2. Five Mariners hit HRs as Seattle knocks out 21 hits in
setting a team record for runs scored.

1995
Brewer P Ron Rightnowar, who was called up from the minors yesterday, makes
his major league debut by hurling 2 1/3 innings of relief in Milwaukee's 7-6
loss to Texas. In doing so, he becomes the 1st replacement player to appear
in a major league game this season. Rightnowar takes over for Sid Roberson,
also making his ML debut, who gets thumbed out of the game for hitting
a batter with a pitch. Boston OF Ron Mahay, another replacement player,
was also called up yesterday, but will not get in a game until tomorrow.

The Mariners obtain P Salomon Torres from the Giants for pitching prospect
Shawn Estes and IF Wilson Delgado.

1996
Led by Chipper Jones and Tyler Houston, each with 5 RBIs, the Braves pound
the Cubs, 18-1, to make Steve Avery's 5th win an easy one. Houston gets
his ribbies when he replaces Fred McGriff in the 5th inning.

The Red Sox pound the A's again, racking up 7 runs in the 3rd to win 16-4. As
in yesterday's 12-2 win, Vaughn and Canseco homer. Mo's homer is his 9th
in his last 12 games and ties him for the AL lead with 17. Bill Haselman
adds 4 hits, including a homer.

1997
Cy Young winner, Pat Hentgen, outpitches Andy Pettitte, to lead Toronto
past New York, 2-0. Hentgen (5-1), who extends his streak of not allowing
an earned run to 39 innings, strikes out 8 and allows 5 hits.

After losing to the Mets, 8-2, in the opener of their doubleheader, the Cubs
win the 2nd game, 4-3, to snap their record-setting 14-game season-opening
losing streak.

In a 10-1 win over Boston, Chicago's Frank Thomas reaches base his first
three times up before flying out against Rich Garces. Thomas reached base 15
straight times, one short of the ML record (HR, 3 2B, 6 1B, 5 BB). Jaimie
Navarro (4-2) is the victor, winning his 10th straight game against the
Red Sox going back to September 28, 1991. He'll lose his next decision to
the Bosox.

Cleveland's Jack McDowell undergoes arthroscopic surgery on his elbow that
will sideline him for two months.

1998
Behind Pedro Martinez (5-0), the Red Sox beat the White Sox, 6-2, pinning
the loss on Jaime Navarro. It is Navarro's 1st loss to the Red Sox following
10 straight wins, dating back to 1991.

The Triple A Indianapolis Indians perform a feat possibly never before
duplicated in professional baseball. In the 5th inning of a game against
Pawtucket, Indianapolis players hit for a "Homer cycle." Pete Rose Jr opens
the inning with a solo HR, Jason Williams connects for a 3-run shot, Glenn
Murray slugs a grand slam and Guillermo Garcia finishes the scoring with
a 2-run blast. The Indians win the game, 11-4.

1999
The Mets sweep the Brewers in a DH, winning the 1st game, 11-10, and the
2nd, 10-1. 3B Robin Ventura slugs a grand slam in each contest, becoming the
1st player in history to do so in both ends of a DH. Ventura also becomes
the 1st player to hit a pair of grand slams on the same day on 2 separate
occasions. As a member of the White Sox in 1995, the infielder also hit a
pair of 'grand salamis' in a game against Texas.

2000
In his initial at-bat for the Mariners, recently acquired Rickey Henderson
hits his record 76th career leadoff homerun against the Devil Rays. Earlier
in the month, the Mets released the future Hall of Famer for not hustling. The
Devil Rays defeat the Mariners today, 4-3.

Catcher Keith Osik of the Pittsburgh Pirates is pressed into service as a
relief pitcher in the ninth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals. Manager
Gene Lamont has Osik finish the game and save the bullpen with the Pirates
down, 14-3. Osik made a relief appearance last year giving up four runs in
one inning of work, and today is not any better as he allows 5 runs on 5
hits, hits 2 batters, has a wild pitch and gives up a homerun in one inning.

2001
The Braves defeat the Giants, 11-6, despite 2 HRs - #515 and #516 - by Barry
Bonds. His 5 four-baggers, including 4 consecutive (the thirteenth player
in major league history to do so), in 2 games ties a ML mark. Bonds also
homered on the 17th and 18th, giving him 7 HRs in his last 4 games. Atlanta
does a bit of homering of their own, thanks in part to Giants reliever Alan
Embree who gives up taters to 4 of the first 6 batters he faces in the 7th
inning. He is the first reliever since Paul Foytack of the 1963 Los Angeles
Angels to surrender four long balls in an inning. The Giants add a HR to
tie the two team mark for the inning.

The Red Sox beat the Royals, 10-3, as Jason Varitek is 4 for 4 hitting 3
HRs and an RBI single and drives in 7 runs. Varitek came into the game with
2 homers. Ramirez and Carl Everett solo to back Frank Castillo's pitching.

2002
Behind a combined 2-hitter by Derek Lowe (7-1) and Rich Garces, the Red Sox
defeat the visiting White Sox, 9-0. Shea Hillenbrand pokes a 3-run homer,
a 303-foot drive around the Pesky pole, one of the shortest homers in
decades. It lands in the front-row lap of a youngster.

2004
Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny handles his 1,295th chance without an error
to establish a major league record for backstops. Charles Johnson, playing
for Florida, had set the previous mark in 1997.

Los Angeles Dodger farmhand Chuck Tiffany of the Single-A Columbus Catfish
has 2 wins this season, both no-hitters. The South Atlantic League lefty
notched his first victory on May 3 when he combined with reliever Marcos
Carvajal to no-hit the Greensboro Bats. Today Tiffany twirls a 7-inning
perfect game against the Bats for his second win.

2005
Minnesota's Carlos Silva throws just 74 pitches in a 7-1 complete game win
against the Milwaukee Brewers. The only Brewer run is a homer by Damian
Miller. Juan Castro has a HR for the Twins and Nick Punto 4 hits.

2006
After barreling over fellow catcher Michael Barrett in a play he considered
hard but clean, A.J. Pierzynski is surprised when the Cub backstop shows his
displeasure by punching him in the face. The incident ignites a bench-clearing
brawl between the Windy City rivals that leads to a 15-minute delay and four
ejections during the White Sox' 7-0 victory at U.S. Cellular Field. The two
catchers are ejected as well as Cubs Brian Anderson and John Mabry. Barrett
will be slapped with a ten-game suspension next week. Freddy Garcia throws
eight shutout innings today.

After a 29 at-bat homerless drought, Barry Bonds finally catches Babe Ruth
with his 714th homerun. The historic homer, which ties the designated hitter
for second place for career round trippers, comes during the second inning
of an interleague contest with the A's with the pitch thrown by southpaw
Brad Halsey landing in the first deck of the right-center stands of McAfee
Coliseum. The Giants defeat the Athletics today, 4-2, in 10 innings.

2009
After setting a franchise record in the sixth inning with 11 putouts in
the outfield, Jacoby Ellsbury ties the big league mark when he catches the
final out of the game for #12. The Red Sox center fielder equals the 1929
performance of Braves outfielder Earl Clark and Lymon Bostock, who also
accomplished the feat in 1977 playing for the Twins.

2010
Trailing the Reds 9-3 starting the bottom of the ninth, Brooks Conrad's
pinch-hit grand slam gives the Braves an amazing 10-9 walk-off victory at
Turner Field. The seven-run ninth inning's big blow by the 30-year-old
rookie barely clears the fence with the ball deflecting off Lance Nix'
glove when the left fielder reaches over the top of the wall at the 380-foot
sign. Conrad also hit a grand slam on May 20 and becomes the only rookie
in Major League history to hit two pinch-hit grand slams in the same season
and the fifth overall. The others to accomplish this feat are Davey Johnson
of the Philadelphia Phillies, Mike Ivie of the San Francisco Giants, Darryl
Strawberry of the New York Mets and Ben Broussard of the Cleveland Indians.

2012
Babe Ruth's circa 1920 jersey sells to an undisclosed buyer for $4,415,658,
the largest amount ever paid for a piece of sports memorabilia according
to auctionreport.com. The woolen uniform top was probably worn by the Babe
during his first season with the Yankees after being traded by Red Sox'
owner Harry Frazee.

2017
Terry Collins passes Davey Johnson (1984-1990) to become the longest-tenured
manager in Mets history, reaching 1,013 games with the team. The 67 year-old
baseball lifer, the oldest skipper in the majors, sees his charges hang
on to a 7-5 victory when Addison Reed strikes out Angel pinch-hitter Danny
Espinosa on a 3-2 count with the bases loaded after three runs have scored
in the top of the ninth inning at Citi Field.
