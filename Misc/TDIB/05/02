May 2

1901
Under overcast skies at Chicago, the Tigers score 5 runs in the top of
the 9th to take a 7-5 lead over the Sox. Clark Griffith then decides to
stall, hoping that rain will wash out the last inning out and the score
will revert to the 8-inning total. Umpire Tom Connolly is in no mood for
the slowdown tactics and forfeits the game to Detroit, the first forfeit
in the AL. Detroit will win a forfeit against Baltimore on May 31st.

Against the Philadelphia Athletics and their untested rookie pitcher Pete
Loos, the visiting Boston Somersets score a pair in the first inning, explode
for 9 runs in the 2nd inning, then do better in the 3rd by scoring ten runs,
a ML record scoring spree of 19 runs for consecutive innings. The aptly
named Loos walks the first 4 hitters in the 2nd, then exits after going 2-0
on the 5th batter. Vet Bill Bernhard relieves with little effect. The final
score is 23-12, with a record 9 players scoring two or more runs. The A's
have four players scoring twice for a 2-team ML-record 13, a mark not tied
until the same two teams match it in 1950. For Pete Loos, it is his only
MLB appearance. Parson Lewis is the winner.

1902
At Boston, the Orioles tag Cy Young for 6 runs in the first inning and
the ace is folded. Baltimore scores another 8 runs off reliever George
Prentiss (who pitched as George Wilson last year) to win 14-6. Baltimore
likes Prentiss so much they will purchase him in June.

1903
At Pittsburgh, Jack Taylor matches up with the Buccaneers' rookie Cy
Falkenberg for the second time in a week and again Chicago wins. This time,
10-5; on the 26th of April, it was 9-6.

1904
At Huntington Grounds, the A's Rube Waddell stops Boston on one hit, a
spoiler by Patsy Dougherty, in beating Jesse Tannehill, 3-0. Rube taunts
Cy Young to face him and suffer the same fate, and the two aces will square
off on the 5th.

1906
Behind Carl Lundgren, the Chicago Colts clip the St. Louis Cardinals,
5-1. It is Lundgren's 10th straight win over St. Louis stretching back to
May 25, 1904.

1907
Making his first pro start, Willie Humes of Bloomington (Three I) hurls a
no-hitter, beating Springfield, 12-1.

1909
Honus Wagner steals his away around the bases in the first inning of the
nitecap against Chicago. It is the 3rd time he has performed this feat,
a NL record. The Pirates take both games in Chicago, winning 5-2 and 6-0,
swiping 2 bases in the opener and 6 steals (plus 2 walks, a batter hit by
a pitch, two errors, and two hits) in first inning of the nitecap.

In a 6-5 Detroit win over the White Stockings, Ty Cobb is thumbed out of
a game for the first time. He tries stretching a double and is called out
at 3B. Then he is tossed out by Silk O'Loughlin.

1910
Aided by a 13-game winning streak, the Athletics take first place in the
AL. New York will wrest it from them for a brief spell in June; otherwise,
the A's will hold the top spot all season.

In Pittsburgh, baseball fan President William Howard Taft watches the
Pirates top Chicago, 5-2.

At Washington Park, Christy Mathewson pitches a beautiful one-hitter to beat
Brooklyn, 6-0. Only an error by Merkle on a Zack Wheat grounder in the 7th
and a disputed hit in the 8th mar Matty's performance. In the 8th inning,
Pryor McElveen hits a grounder to short, but 3B Art Devlin cuts in front
and his throw is low to 1B. It is ruled a hit even though the New York Times
called it an error:  its headline tomorrow proclaims "Brooklyn Gets No-hit
By Mathewson."

1912
At South End Grounds, the hometown Braves score ten runs in the first
two innings and hold on to defeat the Superbas (Dodgers), 11-7. Brooklyn
scores four runs in the bottom of the third to knock out Boston's starter
Buster Brown.

1916
The Giants pick up their first win in 9 games as Jeff Tesreau allows just
3 hits in beating Brooklyn, 3-1.

1917
The Cubs lefthander Hippo Vaughn and righthander Fred Toney of the Reds
toe the mound in Chicago for a one-of-a-kind game. The Reds put up an all
righthanded batting order, benching Ed Roush, who will lead the NL with a
.341 BA. At the end of 9, both pitchers have no-hitters. With one out in the
top of the 10th Larry Kopf lines the first hit of the game. One out later
Hal Chase lines to Cy Williams, who drops the ball for an error. Chase then
steals 2B, and with runners on 2B and 3B, Jim Thorpe hits a swinging bunt
near the mound. Vaughn picks it up and, with no play at 1B, fires home,
but C Art Wilson, not expecting the throw, freezes and the ball hits his
chest protector. Kopf slides in for the only run. Each pitcher walks 2 and
the Zeider's error allows one other base runner. Fred Toney sets the Cubs
down in order and has the 4th 10-inning no-hitter to date. The run scored
by the Reds is their first in 35 innings.

1919
In St. Louis, the Reds lose their first of the year, 8-1, after winning 6
straight. The Cards Oscar Horstmann walks 5 in the 1st, 2 in the 2nd and
is lifted with a 3-ball-count on the 3rd batter. But the Reds manage just
2 hits. Reds SS Kopf has no fielding chances.

1920
The first game of the National Negro Baseball League is played in Indianapolis
when the hometown ABC's beat the Chicago Giants at Washington Park,
4-2. Schorling's Park, the home field of the Giants, will be unavailable
for another month due to the occupation of the National Guard, stationed
there as a result of the The Chicago Race Riot of 1919, prompting the delay
of the inaugural season in the Windy City, a huge disappointment for the
newly-formed league.

Dropping their 13th consecutive decision, the Tigers still do not have a
victory this season as the team loses to Cleveland, 5-2. Jim Bagby is the
winner, allowing 8 hits. Lefty Red Oldham takes the loss. The club's futile
0-13 start matches the major league mark set by the 1904 Washington Senators.

In Brooklyn, the Phillies win in 13 innings, 4-3. Zack Wheat's homer in
the 9th ties the match, and Dave Bancroft scores the go ahead run in the
13th. Casey Stengel's sensational catch of Mitchell's long fly prevents
another tie.

1921
Batting against the Braves, the Giants' George Burns hits a grounder to SS
Walter Barbare, who boots it. Barbare then throws his glove at the ball
hitting it, and the umpires invoke the thrown glove rule, giving Burns a
triple. The Giants don't need the advantage, winning 8-1.

1922
With 2 outs, Washington's George Mogridge serves up consecutive homeruns
to 3 Philadelphia batters - Tilly Walker, Cy Perkins, and Bing Miller. It
has been done twice before:  June 30, 1902 and May 10, 1894. The A's win,
11-2, behind Bob Hasty.

1923
Walter Johnson gets his 100th shutout, and New York SS Everett Scott gets a
gold medal from the AL for playing in his 1,000th consecutive game. Scott's
skein began on June 20, 1916. Washington defeats the Yankees 3-0, as Big
Train allows just 3 hits. Johnson will blank the opponents 110 times during
his 21 years in the major leagues.

1925
Boston and the Phillies split a pair, with Joe Genewich winning the opener,
4-1, for the Braves. Hal Carlson is the Phillies winner, 12-6, in the
nitecap. Boston's Dick Burrus, back in the majors after a 5-year hiatus,
hits his 1st ML homer, off Carlson. Burrus will collect 200 hits and post
a .340 average.

1926
Walter Johnson wins his 4th game, a 4-3 victory over the A's. Slim Harriss
is the loser.

For the 4th straight game, the Cubs come from behind to win, beating the
Cardinals, 6-5. Alexander picks up the victory, and Wee Willie Sherdel is
the loser.

1928
John McGraw pays the supreme compliment to Dodger rookie Del Bissonette (20
for 60 with 11 extra base hits) by ordering him walked in the 9th inning
with the bases loaded and 2 out (as noted by Bill Deane). Giants pitcher
Larry Benton had allowed 2 hits before the 9th inning and is nursing a 2-0
lead. Bissonette walks forcing home a run, and Harry Riconda then strikes out.

1930
Due to 102 degree fever, Joe Sewell's consecutive streak ends at 1,103 games
when he doesn't appear in a game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. The
Indian shortstop, who hasn't missed a game since 1922, is only 204 games
shy of the all-time record of 1,307 games set in 1925 by Yankee shortstop
Everett Scott.

Des Moines (Western League) defeats Wichita 13-6 to open the first ballpark
with permanently installed lights. The game drawa 12,000 fans instead of the
usual 600 patrons. The field is a predecessor of Sec Taylor Stadium. The
Demons' victory was the first night game to be broadcast nationally and
is the beginning of a concept which will spread quickly through the minors
and spare many organizations from the on-slaught of the Great Depression.

1931
Hack Wilson hits his first HR of 1931 as the Cards beat the Cubs 6-3 at
St. Louis. After hitting 56 homers last year, Wilson will hit only 13 with
the deader NL ball. The MVP will end up as an alternate in the Cubs outfield.

1932
At Fenway, Jimmy Foxx clouts an 11th inning homer to give the A's a 3-2 win
over the Red Sox. The victory snaps a 6-game losing streak. Lefty Grove is
the winner with 2 innings of relief.

1933
Lon Warneke shuts out the Giants, and the Cubs beat up on Hal Schumacher
to win, 11-0. Billy Herman is 4 for 4 and Gabby Hartnett drives in 5 runs
on 2 homers.

1934
The Giants beat the Dodgers, 6-5, for a series sweep and take over first
place in the NL. Lefty O'Doul, pinch hitting for Travis Jackson in the 8th,
homers with two on off reliever Van Lingle Mungo. Charlie Perkins takes the
loss against Hal Schumacher. Mel Ott hits his 6th homer of the year in the
3rd with Bill Terry on base.

Heinie Meine outpitches Lon Warneke to give the Pirates a 4-2 win over the
Cubs. Chicago drops to 2nd place with the loss.

1936
The Cleveland Indians leave Boston tonight for Washington under a medical
injunction to take precautions against contagion from the spinal meningitis
afflicting right fielder Bruce Campbell. The Indians, 7-3 winner today over
Boston, will be allowed to play the Senators tomorrow, but every player is
told to isolate himself from family and children for three weeks.

Bucky Walters, infielder turned pitcher, holds the Reds to 7 hits in 7 2/3
innings, and bats in the winning run to give the Phils a 4-3 win. Philadelphia
scores all its runs in the 6th when they drive Al Hollingsworth, Cincy's
leading pitcher, from the mound.

Toronto (IL) pitcher Leroy Hermann pitches a 10-inning no-hit no-run game
against Newark.

1938
Pinky Higgins equals the 2-day-old ML mark for errors by a 3B, making 4 for
Boston against Philadelphia. But Pinky knocks in 2 as the Sox route the A's,
13-1, behind Johnny Marcum.

University of California All-American football star Sam Chapman signs with
the Athletics for a $8,500 bonus.

The Giants announce that 2B Burgess Whitehead is out for the season following
a nervous breakdown.

With Gehrig batting 6th and DiMaggio at the cleanup spot for the 2nd game
in a row, the Yankees edge the host Senators, 3-2. DiMag homers while Gehrig
has a single.

The Indians score 10 runs in the 4th inning and beat the Tigers, 11-3. Averill
has the lone HR in the game.

1939
After carrying out the scorecard to the umpires, Lou Gehrig voluntarily
benches himself "for the good of the team." He is batting .143 with one
RBI. His consecutive-game string, which began in 1925, stops at 2,130. Babe
Dahlgren, his replacement, has a homer and double, as the Yankees rout
Detroit 22-2. New York bats around in three innings to make it easy for Red
Ruffing. Ballyhooed Tiger teenager Fred Hutchinson makes his major league
debut and the Yankees light him up for eight runs in 2/3 of an inning. Hutch
gives up 4 hits and walks five.

In New York, Mel Ott's three run homer with two out in the 9th gives New
York a dramatic 8-7 win over Cincy. Ott's blow is hit off Cincy righty
Gene Thompson.

It's showtime in Hollywood as Gilmore Field premieres with the Stars (PCL)
losing to the Seattle Rainiers, 8-5. The stars are in the stands as well
including a number who own stock in the team:  Gracie Allen, Gene Autry,
George Burns, Gary Cooper, Cecil B. DeMille, George Raft, Gary Cooper, William
Powell, Robert Taylor and the owner's wife Gail Patrick (Mrs. Bob Cobb).

1942
Cleveland beats the Senators 12-3 in Washington behind Jim Bagby's 5th
straight win. The win gives the first-place Indians (12-3) 13 straight
victories. The Red Sox will end the streak tomorrow.

For the second straight game, Ted Williams cracks a 9th-inning HR, this
time off Eldon Auker, to give the Red Sox a 10-10 tie with the visiting
Browns. Bobby Doerr's RBI double wins it, 11-10. Pesky pulls off a hidden
ball trick in the 9th, but it is for naught as Doerr, unaware of the ruse,
calls time out before the play. Eldon Auker goes the distance allowing 17
hits in the loss.

The Reds sell OF Ernie Koy to the Phils and Frank Secory to Milwaukee (AA).

1943
Phillies pitcher Schoolboy Rowe pinch hits with the bases loaded in the
6th inning and cracks a grand slam off Braves righty Al Javery to break a
tie. The Phils win, 6-5, but it takes them 12 innings. For Rowe, it is his
2nd grand slam - he hit one in 1939 while with Detroit - and he is the only
pitcher to hit a grand slam in each league. He'll finish the 1943 season
with a .306 average as a pinch hitter.

Behind the strong pitching of Wally Hebert and Bob Klinger, the Pirates twice
shut out the Cubs, winning 3-0 and 1-0. Hi Bithorn loses game one. In the
second game, Cubs hurlers Dick Barrett and Lon Warneke combine on a hardluck
one-hit loss:  Vince DiMaggio's hit in the 4th is the only safety. Barrett,
35 and making his NL debut, can't blame his offense on the new cement ball;
1942 baseballs are used.

1944
Red Sox outfielder Ted Williams receives his pilot wings, and the 25-year-old
ballplayer is commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. The
future Hall of Famer, fighting in both WW II and Korean Wars, will miss
five years of playing time during the span of his major league career.

Phillies P Charley Schanz takes a 1-0 no-hitter into the 7th inning before
giving up a 2-run homer to Joe Medwick of the Giants, the only Giants' hit
of the day. Schanz wins his own game by clearing the bases with a triple
in the 9th.

1945
The first-place Giants take a 7-0 lead over the host Phillies, then hold
on for a 9-8 win.

1946
In St. Louis, Giants manager Mel Ott informs C Clyde Kluttz at breakfast
that he has been traded from New York to the Phillies. But Cards manager
Eddie Dyer calls Kluttz at lunch to tell him not to pack; St. Louis has
just made a trade for him. Kluttz is part of the trades that sends Vince
DiMaggio from the Phils to the Giants and 2B Emil Verban from St. Louis to
Philadelphia. The Giants then beat the Cards, 5-1, scoring 4 in the 9th. Dave
Koslo tosses a 4-hitter for New York, beating Harry Brecheen. Brecheen fans
three in the 3rd - Kerr, Koslo, and Rigney - all on called strikes.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks do all their scoring in the 4th to beat
Cleveland, 8-2. Nick Etten cracks a grand slam and then ends the inning by
lining into a DP with the bases loaded. Spud Chandler wins his 4th straight.

Ailing Ted Williams hits his 2nd homer of the year, a 10th inning blow that
gives the Sox a 5-4 win over the Tigers. It is the Red Sox' 7th straight
win and keeps them two games ahead of the Yankees.

1947
Bob Feller fires his 2nd one-hitter in 10 days, stopping the Red Sox, 2-0,
while striking out 10. Johnny Pesky has the only safety. Joe Gordon's homer
off Ferriss is the only run Feller needs.

Ken Myers of the Las Vegas Wranglers (Class C Sunset League) connects for
two grand slams in the 3rd inning against Ontario. Pitcher Ned Klingensmith
adds a 3rd slam in the inning as the Wranglers score 16 runs. Las Vegas
hits 10 homers in the game to win, 30-5.

1948
Rookie OF Hal Jeffcoat has 2 doubles in the Cubs' 7-run 8th inning as
Chicago rolls over Cincinnati 13-4. Peanuts Lowrey goes 4 for 5 in the game.

The Phillies and Dodgers divide a doubleheader, Brooklyn outslugging the
Blue Jays 9-6 in the opener, then losing, 2-0, to Ken Heintzelman. Furillo
has a HR, triple and single in the opener, while Duke Snider hits his first
2 ML homers (the first, inside-the-park), a triple and a single, good for
4 RBIs. Ben Chapman starts Dutch Leonard but after one out brings in Curt
Simmons against the lefty Dodger lineup. In the nitecap, Furillo's 2-out
single in the 7th is the first hit off Heintzelman, who pitches a 4-hitter.

1951
As a pinch hitter Lou Limmer goes deep off Tigers' right-hander Saul Rogovin
in the top of the ninth to tie the game at 3-3, in the A's eventual 5-3
extra inning loss at Briggs Stadium. It is the first time in major league
history that a Jewish batter faces a Jewish pitcher with a Jewish catcher
(Joe Ginsberg) behind the plate.

Before 4,976 at the Polo Grounds, the Giants score 6 runs in the 7th to defeat
the Cubs, 8-1. George Spencer, who won the final game of the 1950 season,
makes his 1951 debut a successful one, allowing six hits. Johnny Schmitz takes
the loss for Chicago. Ray Noble has two ribbies for New York. Noble is playing
for Wes Westrum, who broke his finger yesterday when he was hit by a foul tip.

1952
After allowing no hits through 8 innings, the Cubs' Turk Lown cracks under
the strain and gives up 3 hits and loses to the Dodgers, 3-1. Billy Loes
is the winner in relief. The Cubs score in the first on a double steal by
Bob Addis and Frankie Baumholtz.

The A's draw just 3,679 who view a see-saw battle with the White Sox,
with the A's winning 13-12. "We kicked the extra point," quips Jimmy Dykes
afterwards. The A's score 5 in the 1st on one hit and 4 walks, but the Sox
rally and take a 12-7 lead in the 6th on Lollar's 3-run HR. A 5-run 7th
knots it and Majeski's single in the 9th scores Zernial.

1953
Pirates OF Carlos Bernier hits 3 consecutive triples in a 12-4 win over the
Redlegs, the Corsairs 4th straight win. Bernier adds a single and a stolen
base. Kiner and Jim Greengrass match homers. In a stretch of 11 at-bats,
Carlos will hit 4 triples, 2 doubles and 2 singles.

1954
Stan Musial hits 5 HRs in a doubleheader with the Giants in St. Louis. In
attendance is 8-year-old Nate Colbert, who will be the only other player
in history to accomplish this feat (in 1972, as a 26-year-old Padres first
baseman). The Cards win the first game 10-6 when Musial's three-run homer
in the 8th off Jim Hearn. Stan's first two homers are served up by Johnny
Antonelli. The Cards hit 5 homers in the opener, while the Giants hit three,
including back-to-back blows by Westrum and Lockman. In the nightcap of
the doubleheader, Don Mueller goes 5 for 5, and the Giants win, 9-7, with
8 runs in the 4th inning. Musial totals a since-topped record 21 bases in
the two games, going 4 for 4 with a walk in game 1, and 2 for 4 with a walk
in game 2. Don Mueller has 6 hits for New York.

The Dodgers bench C Roy Campanella, who is hitting only .167, but the game in
Milwaukee is rained out. Tomorrow, he will undergo surgery for the removal
of bone chips from his left hand.

Chicago's Connie Johnson tosses a 2-hitter at the A's to win, 4-0, before
losing to the A's, 2-1. Elmer Valo's pinch single in the 9th wins the
nitecap for reliever Marion Fricano.

At Chicago, the Cubs and Pirates split. Chicago's Paul Minner outguns Vern
Law in the opener, 5-3, and the Pirates outhit Chicago to win the nitecap,
18-10, in 8 innings. Frank Thomas has 7 straight hits on the afternoon for
Pittsburgh. Hank Sauer hits three homers for Chicago, two in the nitecap, when
he goes 4 for 4:  Sauer will belt 13 homers this season against the Pirates
- a ML record for HRs against one team (set by Jimmie Foxx and later tied
by Joe Adcock, in 1956). Bob Skinner has 3 hits to drive in 5 runs for the
Bucs in game 2, as his team scores 15 runs in the first 4 innings. Winning
pitcher Bob Friend also drives in three runs to win his first of the year,
even though he gives up 10 runs in the victory. Not until Vida Blue, in
1979, will anyone allow 10 runs in a win. With homers in both games today,
the Cubs set an NL mark of 13 straight games in which they've homered since
the start of the season.

At Yankee Stadium, Detroit's Bill Hoeft pitches a 5-inning one hitter to win
4-0. A 5th inning double by Andy Carey is the only safety for the Yanks as
rain shortens to contest. The Yanks take the opener, 12-4, scoring six runs
in the 3rd inning. Allie Reynolds is the winner with six innings of relief.

1955
At Ebbets, Carl Furillo raps his 8th HR with Robinson on base in the 12th
inning to give the Dodgers a 2-0 win over the Braves. Carl Erskine wins
his 4th straight, beating Conley, as both pitchers go the distance.

1956
Twenty-five Giants and 23 Cubs appear - a ML record - in a 17-inning
marathon finally won by the visiting Giants 6-5. The two teams combined
to intentionally walk 11 batters, a ML record, with the Cubs contributing
7 of the free passes. Losing pitcher Jim Brosnan chipped in with 4 walks,
all intentional. Cub 3B Don Hoak was not one of the strollers, whiffing a
NL record 6 times - all against different pitchers, (Carl Weilman in 1913
set the ML record with 6 strikeouts in a 15-inning AL game) while Ernie
Banks, Willie Mays and Wes Westrum are twice walked intentionally. There
are 8 unintentional walks for a total of 19. Whitey Lockman starts in LF,
goes to 1B, returns to LF, and finishes at 1B. Ex-Giant Monte Irvin is 0
for 5 against 5 pitchers. The game is 6 minutes shy of the 5:19 record set
by the Dodgers-Braves in 20 innings in 1940.

LF Lee Walls of the Pirates goes 5 for 5 against St. Louis in a 10-inning
10-9 loss to St. Louis.

Detroit's Yankee killer Frank Lary tames New York 8-1 at the Stadium. Mantle's
9th inning HR is New York's only score, as they drop into 2nd place behind
the White Sox.

1957
Robin Roberts strikes out 13 Cubs enroute to a 4-2 Phillies win. No Phils
infielders record an assist in the game.

At the Polo Grounds, Don Hoak drives in 5 runs to lead the Reds to a 9-7
win over the Giants.

1958
In what nearly turns into a TV war, the Yankees threaten to broadcast
their games nationwide if the NL goes ahead with its plans to allow other
broadcasts, especially those of the Dodgers and Giants, into New York
territory.

At St. Louis, George Crowe drives in 6 runs in a 7-3 Reds win over the
Cardinals.

1959
Frank Robinson of the Reds hits for the cycle in a 16-4 rout of the Dodgers.

The Red Sox send P Dave Sisler and 2B Ted Lepcio to the Tigers for P Billy
Hoeft, then trade Hoeft on June 15 to Baltimore for P Jack Harshman. Harshman
will last a month before he's sold to the Indians.

1960
Ron Kline's 7-hitter gives the Cardinals a 4-3 win and ends Pittsburgh's
win-streak at 9 games, the club's longest since 1945. Roy Face issues a
bases-loaded walk in the 9th for his 2nd straight loss.

Playing at a converted football stadium because their own Russwood Park
was destroyed by fire on April 17, the Memphis Chicks and Birmingham set
a Southern League one-game record with 11 HRs, 6 of which clear a RF fence
just 204 feet from home plate. Afterward, all drives over the RF fence are
declared doubles until home plate can be moved. The Chicks move to Tobey
Park in mid-July.

1961
In their first appearance in Minnesota, the Yankees top the transplanted
Washington team, 6-4. Mantle's grand slam in the 10th inning off Camilo
Pascual is the big blow. Luis Arroyo picks up the save after the Twins
score 2. Mick's extra inning grand slam is the 6th by a Yankee joining Pipp
(1923), Ruth (1925), Meusel (1929), and DiMaggio and Henrich (1948).

Don Cardwell and the Cubs top the Giants, 9-4, though Willie McCovey's 2-run
homer in the 9th gives San Francisco a record-tying total of 14 homers in
3 games.

1962
At Minnesota, Baltimore's Boog Powell hits his first 2 ML homers, off Jim
Kaat and Ted Sadowski, to help the O's to a 6-5 win.

1963
At Crosley Field, Milwaukee's Bob Hendley twirls a 3-hit shutout, winning
8-0. All three hits are by Leon Cardenas, who smacks a double and 2 singles.

The Twins trade P Jack Kralick (1-4) to Cleveland for P Jim Perry
(0-0). Kralick was 13-11 and 12-11 in his last two years, and will finish
with a 13-9 record this year for Cleveland. Perry will spend more than a
decade with the Twins, posting two 20-win seasons to tie Pascual for a club
record. He'll return to Cleveland in 1974.

1964
Posting a 7-3 victory, the Twins become only the third team in major league
history to hit four consecutive homeruns in an inning as Tony Oliva, Bob
Allison, Jimmie Hall and Harmon Killebrew all go deep against A's pitchers
Dan Pfister (3) and Vern Handrahan (1) in the top of the 11th frame at
Kansas City's Municipal Stadium. The Twins total 6 homers in the win. The
A's will surrender 220 round trippers breaking the big league mark of 199
established by the team's pitching staff last season.

1967
Washington and Kansas split a pair, each by 10 scores. Pete Richert is the
winner for Washington in the opener, beating Lew Krausse. Catfish Hunter
returns the compliment, topping Jim Hannan in game 2.

1968
During a 3-0 loss to the Mets, Phillies reliever John Boozer is ejected in
the 7th by umpire Ed Vargo at Shea Stadium for throwing spitballs during
his warm-up pitches. After the first time he goes to his mouth, the umpire
calls a ball, even though the batter was not in the box. Manager Gene Mauch
comes out to argue and orders Boozer to go to his mouth on the next two
pitches as well, earning both Boozer and Mauch ejections. Mauch protests
the game. Boozer is only the 2nd ML pitcher to be ejected from a game for
throwing spitballs. Dick Hall, who replaces Boozer with a 3-0 count on Bud
Harrelson, gets him to ground out. Nolan Ryan notches his second career
win. Tomorrow, National League President Warren Giles will rule that a
pitcher shouldn't be charged with a ball while warming up. If a pitcher
touches his mouth while warming up, he would be required to dry his fingers
before delivering a pitch to the batter.

1969
Al Lopez (840-650) resigns as White Sox manager for health reasons. Don
Gutteridge takes over. The Sox will lose tomorrow, 3-1, to the Twins in
Gutteridge's first game as skipper.

1970
During a 7-1 loss to the Giants, the Phillies lose both of their catchers, Tim
McCarver and Mike Ryan, with broken hands in the 6th inning. McCarver breaks
his hitting when a 2-1 foul catches him. Ryan breaks his when McCovey spikes
him while being tagged out at home in the bottom of the 6th. The two will miss
a combined total of 197 games with both coming back in early September. Jim
Hutto is hastily brought in to pinch hit and catch. The Phillies will call
up the likes of Del Bates and Mike Compton and even use bullpen coach Doc
Edwards, who will bat .269 in 35 games. Gaylord Perry is the CG winner,
allowing a homer to Don Money. Willie McCovey has a double and homer for SF.

Kansas City edges the Indians, 4-3, in 17 innings when Jackie Hernandez
singles in Jim Rooker, who comes in as a pinchrunner and stays in as the left
fielder for the only time in his career. The game lasts longer than Charlie
Metro, tossed in the 12th and Lou Piniella, who gets thumbed in the 16th.

1971
Sam McDowell is suddenly knocked out in the 1st inning at Oakland and
charged with the 8-5 loss. Sam gives up 5 runs, 3 on a homer by Reggie
Jackson. But McDowell comes back in game 2 to win in relief, 7-3, in 10
innings. Ted Ford's 3-run homer is the big blow.

1972
Oakland's Vida Blue ends a long holdout, signing a contract for $63,000. The
young southpaw had received $14,750 in 1971 while winning the AL Cy Young
and MVP awards (24-8, 1.82).

The Mets Gary Gentry fires a two hitter at the Giants in winning 4-2,
and Barry Bonds collects both hits. Both are triples.

The Reds spot the Cards a 6-0 lead, then score 2 in the 6th and 5 in the
7th to win, 7-6. Bobby Tolan's 3-run homer is the big blow in the 7th.

1975
Cubs P Burt Hooton is traded to the Dodgers for pitchers Geoff Zahn and
Eddie Solomon.

1976
A shoving match, after a home-plate collision between Lou Piniella and Red
Sox catcher Carlton Fisk, escalates into an ugly bench-clearing brawl. Yankee
third baseman Graig Nettles and Boston's Bill Lee fight so fiercely that the
'Spaceman' separates his left shoulder, greatly effecting the remainder of
his pitching career.

Jose Cardenal goes 6 for 7, including a double and a HR, driving in 4 runs,

1979
Jose Oquendo makes his major league debut grounding into a force out as a
pinch-hitter in the ninth inning of a 3-2 loss to Houston. The 19-year-old
rookie shortstop, born on July 4, 1963, is the first person to play for
the Mets who is younger than the franchise, which started in 1962.

Bobby Bonds hits his 300th homerun, against Moose Haas, in a 6-1 loss to
Milwaukee. He has 413 SBs at the time and becomes the 2nd player, after
Willie Mays, to have 300 SBs and 300 homeruns.

1980
Paced by Lenny Randle's double and homer in the inning, the Cubs score 8

The Brewers down the Twins 11-4 on two 3-run shots by Ted Simmons, one from
each side of the plate.

1984
LaMarr Hoyt faces 27 batters in a 3-0 one-hitter against the Yankees. New
York's only hit is Don Mattingly's opposite-field blooper in the 7th inning,
which is followed by a double play.

Cleveland's Andre Thornton walks 6 times in an Indians win at Baltimore,
9-7, in 16 innings. Thornton joins Jimmie Foxx (6/16/1938) and Walt Wilmot
(8/22/1891) as the only players to receive this many passes in a game.

1987
After having missed spring training, Montreal's Tim Raines debuts with a
10th-inning grand slam. His 4 for 5 leads the Expos to an 11-7 win over
the Mets.

Graig Nettles and Dion James each hit grand slams to lead the Braves to
a 12-4 rout of the Astros. It is the first time since July 3, 1966 (when
pitcher Tony Cloninger did it by himself), that the Braves have hit 2 grand
slams in one game.

1988
In front 50,402 fans and owner Edward Bennett Williams, who are in attendance
to welcome their 1-23 Orioles back from a 1-11 road trip, Governor William
Donald Schaefer announces that the team and the Maryland Stadium Authority
had agreed upon a long-term lease for a new downtown ballpark to be built
in time to open the 1992 season. Williams will never attend another game
and will pass away on August 13, 1988 after losing his battle with cancer.

Reds manager Pete Rose is suspended for 30 days by NL president Bart
Giamatti, the stiffest suspension ever levied against a manager for an
on-field incident. On April 30th Rose shoved umpire Dave Pallone in the
9th inning of a 6-5 loss to the Mets, inciting a near riot among Cincinnati
fans. Giamatti also calls a meeting in NYC with announcers Marty Brennaman
and Joe Nuxhall to discuss their "inflammatory and completely irresponsible
remarks" during the game.

Reds pitcher Ron Robinson is one out away from a perfect game against the
Expos when pinch hitter Wallace Johnson singles on a 2-2 pitch, and Tim
Raines follows with a homerun. John Franco preserves the Reds' 3-2 victory
for fill-in manager Tommy Helms.

1992
Yankee P Scott Sanderson becomes the 12th pitcher in history to surrender 4
HRs in a single inning. He is rocked in the 5th inning of the game against
Minnesota by Shane Mack, Kirby Puckett, Kent Hrbek and Randy Bush. The
Twins need all the dingers as they win, 7-6.

1993
Texas rolls over the Brewers, 13-2 collecting 15 hits. Canseco has a single,
double and HR before leaving for a pinch runner. Protecting a 12-2 lead,
Jeff Bronkey pitches 3 innings in relief of Nen, and picks up a save in his
ML debut with Texas. Bronkey is the first major leaguer born in Afghanistan.

The Triple-A American Association game between Iowa and Buffalo is called
because of a toxic cloud in Des Moines. The area around the stadium is
evacuated when several barrels of chemicals explode during a fire, releasing
toxic fumes.

1994
For the first time ever, the Cubs do not don their traditional white uniforms
for their game with Cincinnati at Wrigley Field. The change doesn't help,
however, as Chicago records its 11th straight home loss, losing 9-0 to John
Smiley while wearing blue jerseys. Smiley allows just 2 hits.

1995
Mo Vaughn and John Valentin hit grand slams in consecutive innings
accounting for all the runs in the Red Sox' 8-0 victory over the Yankees
at the Stadium. The sluggers were teammates on the Seton Hall University
baseball team. According to SABR statistician David Vincent, it is the 1st
time ever that 2 grand slams account for all the runs scored in a game.

Hideo Nomo hurls 5 innings for the Dodgers in a 13-inning 4-3 loss to the
Giants becoming the 1st Japanese player to appear in the major leagues
since 1964. He allows only 1 hit and no runs, while walking 4 and striking
out 7. The game is scoreless after 12 innings, before the Dodgers plate 3
runs in the top of the 13th. The Giants come back with 4 in their half of
the inning for the win.

The Indians defeat the Tigers, 11-1, on opening day in Detroit. Fans run onto
the field and throw bottles, baseballs and batteries from the bleachers. 20
fans are arrested.

1996
In the 7th inning of the Mariners-Indians game, an earthquake rattles the
Kingdome causing the umps to suspend the game. The quake registers 4.8
on the Richter scale. The Tribe leads 6-3 and the game will be completed
tomorrow before the start of the Friday night game.

After missing his first start in 9 years because of a numbed finger on his
pitching hand, David Cone tosses a complete game 5-1 win over the White
Sox. Jim Leyritz and Paul O'Neill back him with homers.

The Phils pick up J.R. Phillips from the Giants for a player to be named
later.

1998
Darryl Strawberry blasts the first of his two pinch-hit ninth-inning
grand slams this season. The Kauffman Stadium shot, hit off Scott Service,
extends the Yankees lead over Kansas City to 12-6.

Roger Clemens (7 innings) and Paul Quantrill (2 innings) combine to 1-hit
the Athletics, 7-0. Oakland's only hit is a single by rookie Ben Grieve.

will miss three months. Joyner has 3 hits in the game.

1999
Rafael Palmeiro reaches the 2,000 career hit milestone and Juan Gonzales
hits his 3rd HR in 3 games as the Rangers defeat Cleveland, 8-6. Palmeiro,

Eddie Murray as the only players to compile 3,000 hits and 500 home runs
during their major league careers.

With a 2-run single by Gary Gaetti in the 8th, the Cubs push their win
streak to 5 games with a 3-2 win over the Padres. The Pads go the other
way extending their losing streak to 5 games and losing a series for the
first time after 73 consecutive series without being swept. According to
the Elias Sports Bureau, the streak is the 4th longest in this century. The
three longer sweepless streaks were posted by the 1904-06 Philadelphia A's
with 76 consecutive series without a sweep, the 1903-05 New York Giants
with 97 straight and the 1942-44 St. Louis Cardinals with a amazing 132
consecutive series without a sweep.

2000
With his reconstructed elbow, Cubs' Kerry Wood throws in a game for the first
time in nearly 19 months, giving up one run and three hits in six innings
in an 11-1 rout of the Astros. Wood helps himself with one of 3 Cubs homers.

The Royals score 3 runs in the 10th inning to defeat the A's, 8-7. Oakland
P Jason Isringhausen, who was 14 for 14 in career saves, was 2 outs away
from tying the major league mark for consecutive saves to start a career.

The Braves defeat the Dodgers, 5-3, to become the first NL team in 49
years to win 15 consecutive games. The last team to do so was the 1951 NY
Giants. While pitching the 9th inning, Atlanta P John Rocker is approached
by a fan who ran out of the stands. Before security can get to him, the
man turns his back to Rocker, drops his pants, and moons the pitcher. The
Braves' streak will end tomorrow.

2001
At the Metrodome, Yankee right fielder Paul O'Neil singles in the ninth
inning off Twin reliever LaTroy Hawkins becoming the 215th major-leaguer
to record 2,000 hits.

Over 40 fans are ejected and the game, which is delayed for 12 minutes
when the umps need to pull the Yankees off the field, comes close to being
forfeited by the Twins when unruly spectators at the Metrodome pummel
Chuck Knoblauch with coins, plastic beer bottles and golf balls in left
field. Twin skipper Tom Kelly appeals to the crowd to be calm as the home
team defeats their former second baseman and the Yankees, 4-2.

The Braves beat the Brewers, 1-0, as Greg Maddux hurls a 2-hitter and
strikes out a career high 14. Maddux K's 8 of the last 10 batters he faces
as he hurls his 100th complete game. B.J. Surhoff's HR in the 3rd off Paul
Rigdon is the only score.

Oakland's Mike Mulder 3-hits Toronto to win 6-0. Manuel Tejada backs him
with 2 homers.

Texas manager Johnny Oates resigns and Jerry Narron takes over as interim
manager. Narron dodges a bullet when today's game is called after 3 innings
with the visiting White Sox leading, 6-0.

2002
The Mariners rout the White Sox by a score of 15-4 as OF Mike Cameron
becomes the 13th player in ML history to slug 4 HRs in a single game, all
solo shots. Cameron is also hit by a pitch and flies out to deep right in
a bid for a 5th homer. Cameron and 2B Bret Boone also become the first
teammates in history to hit back-to-back HRs twice in the same inning,
performing the feat in Seattle's 10-run 1st inning. The duo waste little
time putting their names into the record book. After Ichiro Suzuki is hit
by a pitch leading off, Boone homers. Cameron follows with a drive off
Jon Rauch that barely cleared the center-field wall and a leaping Kenny
Lofton. Two outs later, Boone again homers on the first pitch, this time
off reliever Jim Parque. Cameron goes to a full count, then homers to
center again. The Mariners also tie a team record with seven homers in
the game. James Baldwin is the easy winner, with 7 innings pitched. There
had only been 39 previous occasions of a player hitting two homeruns in an
inning, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Eric Karros was the last to
do it, on August 22, 2000, for Los Angeles. Mark McGwire was the previous
AL player to do it, on September 22, 1996, for Oakland.

2003
The players' association agrees to a two-year experiment in which the
winning league of the All-Star Game will have home-field advantage during the

a separate ballot of managers, coaches and players to be done during the
week prior to the game to name the additional nine position players and
eight pitchers for each team.

The Devil Rays defeat the hapless Tigers, 2-0, behind Joe Kennedy's
1-hitter. It is the 1st 1-hitter in Tampa Bay history. Kennedy allows a
single to leadoff hitter Angel Torres in the bottom half of the 1st inning,
then holds Detroit in check the rest of the way.

In Toronto, the Blue Jays defeat the Angels, 3-1. The game is interrupted
in the 9th when a fan jumps on the field and jogs toward 2B. Jays second
baseman Orlando Hudson shoves him and he is taken away by guards. Tim Salmon
stretches his hitting streak to 19 games with a HR.

2004
The Atlanta Braves end a 5-7 road trip by making an Atlanta-record tying
seven errors in a 13-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies. The Braves become the
17th team since 1974 to make seven miscues in a contest. The last team to
record more than seven was the 1974 Kansas City Royals who had eight in
a game against the Oakland A's. Braves' third baseman Mark DeRosa leads
the parade with four errors while Marcus Giles made two and Jesse Garcia,
one. DeRosa's total is one short of the NL record held by another Brave,
Dave Brain, who's 5 E's came in an 11-error game by the Boston Braves on
June 11, 1906.

In Japan, American Tuffy Rhodes hit his 300th career homer, connecting in the
bottom of the eighth inning at the Tokyo Dome, where his Yomiuri Giants lost
to the Hiroshima Carp, 4-3. Rhodes, who joined the Giants in the offseason
after eight seasons with the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Pacific League, has
the most homeruns of any foreign player in Japanese baseball history. Rhodes,
who tied Japan's single-season homerun record of 55 in 2001, played for
the Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs before coming to Japan.

2005
With the smallest crowd in the 14-year history of Camden Yards in attendance,
the Orioles eight-game winning streak ends when Toronto beats the Birds in
12 innings, 6-5. Baltimore, with the second-best record in the majors, has
experienced smaller crowds as the result of the relocation of the Montreal
Expos to nearby Washington to play as the Nationals.

Trailing 9-3 after eight innings, the Cardinals mount their greatest
ninth-inning comeback in franchise history defeating the Reds at the Great
American Ballpark. The seven-run rally at Great American Ballpark is fueled
with homers by Jim Edmonds and John Mabry. It is the first time the Reds
blow a 6-run 9th inning lead since 1952.

The Yankees shrug off Andy Phillips' record-tying 5 strikeouts and beat
Tampa Bay, 6-2.

2006
The A's score 6 runs in the top of the 9th against the Angels to ice the game,
10-4. Two of the runs in the 9th are allowed by Chris Bootcheck, who will
be placed on the 15 day DL after it turns out he pulled a left hamstring
muscle running in from the bullpen in the 4th inning to join a brawl.

2007
Thanks to a winning rally that starts with an infield single which is in
play after hitting the second-highest "B" ring at Tropicana Field, the Rays
beat visiting Minnesota, 4-3, in 10 innings. Tomorrow, a mannequin wearing
a Twins uniform will be placed near the spot where Carlos Pena's fortunate
hit struck the roof.

2008
Jose Reyes is thrown out at home plate in an unusual attempt to complete
the cycle with an inside-the-park homer. The shortstop's four hits pace
the Mets' 7-2 win over Diamondbacks, the club's 14th victory in the last
15 games played against Arizona at Chase Field.

Miguel Tejada, Lance Berkman and Carlos Lee hit consecutive homeruns in
the sixth inning of the Astros' 7-4 win over the Brewers.

2017

inning against the Cleveland Indians. He became the 38th player to reach
this mark.
