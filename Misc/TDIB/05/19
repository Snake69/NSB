Banished yesterday for brawling with Pittsburgh manager Fred Clarke, John
McGraw roams the Polo Grounds before today's game with the Pirates, shouting
insults at Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss. McGraw accuses him of controlling
the NL umpires through league president Harry Pulliam and welching on
gambling debts. McGraw is again ejected during the game. Dreyfuss will file
a formal protest with the league about McGraw's behavior, his swearing, and
his shouting "Hey, Barney" at Dreyfuss from the field. He also contends that
the Giants manager offered to wager $10,000 that the Giants would win the
game. McGraw responds to Dreyfuss' complaint by stating that NL President
Pulliam could not "forget his former role as the secretary to Dreyfuss." A
meeting of the Leagues' directors results in a $150 fine and 15-day suspension
for McGraw, but John Brush immediately gets a Superior Court injunction
blocking the suspension and further hearings exonerate McGraw. Today's
match is won by New York, 7-1, as Dummy Taylor bests Chick Robitaille.

the 23rd. The team's losing streak will end at a NL-record 19 games, a mark
that will be tied by the 1914 Reds and broken by the Phils. Reds catcher
Oscar Stanage debuts with one at-bat but will be sold to Newark. Oscar will
anchor the Tiger backstop position for a decade starting in 1909.

1910

SB leader, breaks his right leg tripping over home on the uncontested front

pitches in a game with the Giants. The Giants score three runs in the 6th
inning after Dean is called for a balk by ump George Barr. Losing 4-1 to
Carl Hubbell in the 9th, Dean knocks down Jimmy Ripple with a pitch. Ripple
follows with a bunt on the first base side in a effort to make Dean field the
ball. The bunt, however, bounces to 2B Jimmy Brown, who prepares to throw to
Johnny Mize at 1B. Dean, who had started toward the ball, keeps running and
barrels into Ripple. The two benches empty, and when the field is cleared
by the umpires and policemen, the batter Ripple, who was never put out at
first base, is credited with a single. Catchers Gus Mancuso and Mickey Owens
are ejected after staging their own private boxing match. The only player
who doesn't leave the bench is Hubbell, who wins his 6th straight game of

9 runs in the 2nd inning. Chicago coasts to a 14-1 win at home. Brooklyn
manager Durocher protests the game claiming the Cubs are over the 25-man
limit, but the protest is tossed out. The Cubs will be fined $500 for the

the 15 inch height allowed. At the suggestion of the umps, Casey pitches
from several inches in front of the rubber, but it doesn't help.

1942
The Phillies attempt at duplicating the Dodgers' charity effort fails, as only

Braves have drawn 279,227 for 12 home dates, surpassing last year's attendance
in Boston.

1954
The Phils apologize to 2B Granny Hamner for having him followed by Charles
Leland, a detective. Phils owner Robert Carpenter, suspecting that some

arrested the detective. Carpenter's apology comes with the Phils tied for
2nd place, a game behind St. Louis.

between the O's Hal Brown and Rip Coleman of KC. Coleman will receive credit
for a shutout, though his record for the season will be 0-7.

LF for an inside-the-park HR in the 2nd.

1960
The Yankees send SS Andy Carey to the A's for slugger Bob Cerv. Cerv had
been with the Yanks for 5 years before going to KC where he banged 38 HRs in

claimed in the expansion draft in 1960 and the Yanks will again reacquire him.

1962
Stan Musial gets hit number 3,431, to break Honus Wagner's recognized NL

but this is his last ML homer.

1972
In an exchange of outfielders, Cincinnati trades Bernie Carbo, their
number-one pick in the 1965 draft, to the Cardinals for Joe Hague. Unknown at
the time, the move is precipitated by an ugly incident that occurred when the

contentious negotiation session. The Reds today also beat the Padres, 1-0,
behind Jim McGlothlin. The win gives the Reds a 9-game winning streak.

Arbitrator Dana E. Eischen rules that J.D. Drew, the second overall selection
in last year's amateur draft, remains subject to the draft. Drew's agent,

to meet Boras' demand for $11 million for his client.

1999

originally set on May 13, 1902 and tie the NL record having 7 players with
3+ hits (Pirates - June 12, 1928 and Reds - August 3, 1989). The Rockies

triple in the eighth, driving in 5 runs in the process. Giant Jeff Kent
(1999) as the only other player to accomplish the feat in the stadium's
31-year history. The Pirates defeat the Cardinals, 13-1. The last Pirate
to cycle was Wally Westlake in 1949.

2001
Reversing their original decision, major league baseball's official
statistician, The Elias Sports Bureau, will now list Randy Johnson's 20

and Kerry Wood 20K outings in the 2002 record book.

In a rain-delayed game, the Giants defeat the Braves, 6-3, as Barry Bonds
hits 3 HRs. He takes over 13th place on the all-time homer list.

20-7. It is the first time in franchise history that Expo pitchers have
surrendered that many runs, a span of 5,098 games. It also ties the Padres
club record. The Pads really heat it up in the 5th, scoring 3-3-5-3-3 in
the last 5 innings to score 20 for the second time in franchise history
(July 27, 1996). Bubba Trammell leads with a 3-run homer and 6 RBIs, and
Rickey Henderson adds a 2-run HR in the 8th.

The Detroit Tigers stage a unique promotion - a octopus-throwing contest in
honor of the Stanley Cup Western Conference Championship Series, which began
yesterday at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena. Throwing boiled octopi on the ice is
a hockey tradition in Detroit. Each participant in the Tigers' contest threw
the octopi at a target with the winner getting a limo ride to the nearby
Arena and tickets to the second game of the Conference Championship. Tiger
pitchers Jeff Weaver and Matt Anderson try their luck along with fifty fans,
but neither pitcher hits his target. The Rangers must've thought they were
hitting octopus, as they lose the game, 2-1. Greisinger allows one run in
6 2/3 innings, and Dmitri Young's homer in the 4th snaps a 1-1 tie.

2003
The Indians edge the Tigers, 10-9, despite a 3-HR 7-RBI performance by
Detroit 1B Carlos Pena It was the first three-dinger game by a Tiger player

receiving such a performance. Three-homer games in the majors generally
spell success for the player's team having resulted in 353 wins and 82
losses, or an .811 winning percentage.

of 59 established in 1988.

Yankee spokesman Jason Zillo announces Cracker Jacks, which has been
baseball's most famous snack for over a 100 years, will not be sold at Yankee
Stadium and will be replaced by a product known as Crunch 'n Munch. The
change is being made, according to Yankees' officials, because Crunch
'n Munch tastes better, but may have been really prompted by Frito-Lays'
decision to make only bags and not boxes.

Breaking his own record set two weeks ago, Julio Franco becomes the oldest
player to hit a pinch-hit homerun. The Braves' first baseman is 45 years
269 days old when he accomplishes the feat.

two seasons ago, no-hits the Royals, 7-0, becoming only the third lefty
in franchise history to throw a no-no at Fenway Park. The 24-year-old's
battery mate, Jason Varitek also makes the record books for being the first
backstop to catch four no-hitters in the majors.

2009
Dontrelle Willis wins his first game in nearly 20 months limiting the

his teammates prior to today's contest in St. Louis. The visiting all-star
shortstop and reigning National League batting champ, amidst of being booed
by the Busch Stadium fans, collects three hits and drives in a run in the
Marlins' 5-1 victory over the Redbirds.

Mets center fielder Angel Pagan initiates the tenth triple play in
franchise history when he snags Cristian Guzman's sinking liner with first
and second base occupied. After making the stunning catch that surprises
both of Washington's base runners, the outfielder overthrows the infield,
but catcher Henry Blanco takes the errant toss and throws the ball to Jose
Reyes at second base to double off Livan Hernandez, and then the shortstop
relays the ball to first baseman Ike Davis to triple up Nyjer Morgan making
it the first 9-2-6-3 triple killing in major league history.

Kansas City's Jason Kendall scores his 1000th career run on a Mike Aviles
single in the 3rd inning against the Cleveland Indians. He becomes the

accomplish the feat when he hit a trio of round-trippers at the age of 41
facing the Mets in the Polo Grounds.

2013
After pinch-runner Cliff Lee is picked off first base in the bottom of the
ninth inning, Phillies catcher Erik Kratz, who did not start the contest,
ties the game with a solo homerun to left field off Cincinnati flame thrower
Aroldis Chapman. The improbable Citizens Bank Park comeback is completed
when the next batter, Freddie Galvis, delivers a walk-off homerun, giving
Philadelphia a dramatic 3-2 come-from-behind victory.
