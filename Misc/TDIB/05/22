May 22

1901
At Cincinnati, Reds ace Noodle Hahn strikes out 16 Boston batters enroute
to a 4-3 Reds win. He strikes out the side in three innings and his 16 K's
will stand as the club record until it is matched by Jim Maloney in 1963.

Boston takes a pair from the St. Louis Nationals by 5-4 scores. In game 2,
a triple play in the 2nd inning helps though Cupid Childs scores on the
play. St. Louis also scores in the 1st inning of game 2 when Jesse Burkett
leads off with a homerun. He'll do the same thing tomorrow to tie a ML mark.

1902
In a 6-0 loss to Pittsburgh, Giants' star George Van Haltren, age 36,
snaps a small bone near his right ankle while stealing second base. Van
Haltren is done for the season, and will play only 80 more big league games.

1907
The Giants move back into first place over Chicago with a 7-1 win against
the Cubs.

1911
Boston (NL) hurler Cliff Curtis sets a ML mark by losing his 23rd consecutive
game, 3-1, to the Cardinals. The streak began on June 13, 1910, the season
he lost 18 in a row.

1912
The Giants complete a western trip in first place, beating the Reds today,
6-1. Mathewson is in total control, giving up 3 hits in the 1st three innings,
and then retiring the next 18 batters. The Giants will win 9 straight,
before losing to St. Louis 5-1 on May 31st, and will open a 14-game lead.

In an attempt to shake up the team, the Pirates send veteran Tommy Leach and
pitcher Lefty Leifield to Chicago for 29-year-old Solly Hofman and pitcher
King Cole. Cole, 40-13 in 2+ years of pitching, will be a no show, eventually
pitching in just 17 games for Pittsburgh before ending his career with the
Highlanders. The trade breaks up one of the great trios of Honus Wagner,
Fred Clarke and Leach. The 3 first played together in 1899 at Louisville
and in their 13 years together won 4 league championships and one WS.

1913
Browns rookie Dwight Stone gives up six hits, seven walks and plunks three
batters, but still beats the Yankees, 7-0. The visiting New Yorkers strand a
modern-ML record 15 runners in the shutout by Stone, who will win just one
more game in 1913. Ed Klepfer is the losing pitcher in his only decision
of the year. The record will be matched three times and finally topped,
in 1994. The NL record of 14 runners stranded in a shutout was set less
than 2 weeks ago by Pittsburgh against Philley.

In a ruling that a ballplayer on the field is a "public person," New York
judge Butts throws out a case brought by the National Commission and the
New York Baseball Club against a motion picture company that took movies
of the 1912 World Series. The suit contended that the players' civil rights
were violated by the unauthorized photographs.

The Giants send Red Ames, Heinie Groh and outfielder Josh Devore to Cincinnati
for P Art Fromme and infielder Eddie Grant. The little-used Groh will star
in Cincinnati, and eventually manage the team. Devore will be sold to the
Phillies in August. Grant, a starter until today, will not play until June
4th, so there is some confusion (as noted by Cliff Blau) about whether he
was sold on that date or part of today's trade. The New York Times reports
today the deal as a four-player trade with Grant not part of it. It later
reports Grant's sale to the Giants on June 3.

1914
Ben Tincup becomes the first person from the Cherokee tribe to play in the
major leagues. The 21-year-old Phillies right-hander makes his debut at
Forbes Field in an 8-2 loss to the Pirates.

Otto Hess shuts down the Cubs, 2-0, giving the Braves back-to-back wins
for the first time this year.

1915
The White Sox top Boston again, knocking starter Babe Ruth out in the
2nd. Ruth allows 3 hits in the 1st, walks 3, tosses a wild pitch and throws
a potential DP ball into CF. After he strikes out on 3 pitches from Joe Benz,
the Babe gives up two singles in the 2nd and is lifted. Chicago wins, 11-3.

1916
In a 9-5 loss to the Browns, Yankee pitcher Ray Fisher steals home in the
6th inning.

1918
In a 6-5 12-inning win over the Phillies, Pirate reliever Wilbur Cooper
drives in the winning run with a single. Cooper relieved Harmon in the 10th.

1920
At Philadelphia, the Cubs outslug the Phils, 15-8. Renie Martin pitches
the entire game for the Cubs, with both teams collecting 16 hits. Phils
manager Gavvy Cravath lifts shortstop Dave Bancroft because of poor playing
and the ensuing argument between the two almost comes to blows. Cy Williams
has three hits, including a double and a triple, and 4 runs scored.

1922
The Yankees, who have been sharing the Polo Grounds with the Giants since
1913, begin construction on their own ballpark in the Bronx. The stadium
will become known as the 'House that Ruth Built', acknowledging the Babe's
popularity and influence.

Down 3-0 to the Browns' Vangilder, Babe Ruth finally puts the Yankees on
the board with a homer in the 8th. The Yankees win in the 13th when Ev
Scott's single off Hub Pruett scores Bob Meusel.

1923
Babe Ruth breaks a 1-1 tie between the Yanks and White Sox by clouting a
2-run homer in the 15th inning. The blow breaks up a tense pitching duel
between little Mike Cvengosa and Herb Pennock, who goes all the way giving up
just 4 hits. The Yanks have now won 12 of 13 contests in their western swing.

In a Negro League NL game at St. Louis' Stars Park, Chicago American Giants CF
Cristobal Torriente hits for the cycle, scoring 3 and batting in 7 runs. He
finishes his offensive outburst with a homer in the top of the 9th to give
the American Giants an 11-10 lead. In the bottom of the ninth, Jack Marshall
gets into a jam and Torriente comes in with two out and runners on 2B and
3B. With Cool Papa Bell at the plate, Torriente promptly goes from hero
to goat in the space of two pitches, both of them wild, allowing the tying
and winning runs to score easily.

1925
Pete Donohue goes 5 for 5 with four singles and a homerun when the Reds beat
Philadelphia at the Baker Bowl, 11-2. The 24-year-old right-hander also
gets the win giving up seven hits, only two more than his own production
at the plate, in the complete-game victory.

1926
At Rogers Hornsby Day in St. Louis, the Cards player-manager is presented
$1,000 in gold and a medal as the NL MVP for 1925. The Cards then whip the
Phillies, 9-2, to even their record at .500.

Before the Braves-Cubs game at Wrigley Field, Grover Cleveland Alexander is
given the keys to a Lincoln automobile, a gift from the fans. The Braves
then cuff Alex around and win, 7-1. When the Cubs end their homestand,
Alexander will be left behind in Chicago, and then waived.

1927
At Brooklyn the Dodgers make it easy for Dazzy Vance, beating the Phillies,
20-4, on 22 hits. Willoughby takes the loss without retiring a batter in
the 1st. Babe Herman has 5 singles and a sac fly in 6 trips to the plate.

1928
Sam Langford has a HR and 2 doubles for Cleveland but the White Sox prevail,
4-3. Sox CF Johnny Mostil handles 12 chances, equaling Happy Felsch's
AL record, also made against Cleveland as the Sox win, 4-3. Mostil also
legs it home from 2B with the winning run on a wild pitch by George Uhle,
a rarity this year as the ML reaches a historic low in wild pitches (as
noted by Cliff Blau).

1930
In Philadelphia, the Yankees and the Athletics continue the HR barrage
as the Yankees take both games of a 2nd straight doubleheader, 10-1 and
20-13. Babe Ruth hits a pair of HRs in the opener, as do Ben Chapman and
winning pitcher George Pipgras. The Yanks score 9 runs in the 1st two innings
of the 2nd second game, but the A's come back to tie it at 12 apiece. The
Yanks win the assault, 20-13, as Lazzeri is 4 for 4 while scoring 5 runs
and knocking in 4. Ruth hits another in the 2nd game, while Gehrig powers
3 round trippers to drive in 8 runs. On the A's side, Foxx has 2 homers
to drive in 6 runs. For the afternoon, the teams combine to hit 14 round
trippers, a then-record 10 in game 2.

1932
At Yankee Stadium, the A's top the Yankees, 4-2, behind Lefty Grove. Foxx,
Simmons and Cochrane homer for the 3rd place A's, now 4 1/2 games behind
the first place New Yorkers. The Yanks will win the next 2, however.

1933
Third baseman Joe Sewell of the Yankees fans for the first time this season,
a 3-0 win behind Lefty Gomez over Sewell's old team, Cleveland. Sewell,
playing in his final season, will strike out only 3 more times in 524 at-bats.

1934
The Indians stop the Yankees, 5-1, with Lou Gehrig driving in the lone run
for New York. For the 2nd time in his career, Lou has driven in at least
one run a game for 10 straight games.

1935
After a ruling by Commissioner Landis in which he states that Alabama Pitts
has paid his debt to society, the Albany Senators (IL) sign the legendary
athletic star parolee from Sing Sing prison. The Senators, a farm team of
Washington, are managed by Pitts' friend Johnny Evers. Pitts will have 2
hits in his first game but afterwards weak-hitting Albany will release
him. He'll sign with York (New York-Penn) and move on to the Charlotte
Hornets (Carolina) on July 28, 1936. On June 7, 1941, Pitts will die after
getting knifed in a barroom brawl.

1936
Phils pitcher Bucky Walters shuts out the Dodgers, 15-0. Fred Fitzsimmons,
routed before getting an out, is the loser. The big blow in the 7-run 1st
inning is a grand slam by Pinky Whitney.

Collecting 17 hits, including 8 doubles, the Cards overwhelm the Pirates,
11-4. Dizzy Dean breezes to his 6th win and the Cards increase their lead
to 1 1/2 games. Pepper Martin scores in his 13th consecutive game, but will
go runless tomorrow.

1937
Facing Wes Ferrell in Boston, Hank Greenberg hits a long centerfield homerun
out of Fenway Park. It exits to the right of the flag pole and is called
the longest HR ever hit at Fenway. Gee Walker has 3 hits to run his hit
streak to 26 straight games, but the Red Sox counter with 14 hits of their
own to win, 11-9. Walker's streak will end on the 24th after 27 games.

The Athletics regain the AL lead by beating the White Sox, 10-9 in
11 innings. In the inning, however, they need 2 singles, runner safe on
an error, and 3 walks to win the game as Chicago C Luke Sewell picks one
runner off at 2B and throws another out at 3B on a steal try.

Before a 6-2 loss to the Reds in Cincinnati, the Dodgers announce that
Van Lingle Mungo has been fined, suspended for 3 days, and given a bill for
$1,500 worth of damage done to a St. Louis hotel room following a ruckus last
week with teammates trying to get him to bed at 4 A.M. When a photographer
asks to take a picture of Van Mungo's black eye, the pitcher replies,
"You can take it for $1,000, because that's what it cost me to get it."

1938
Ted Lyons records his 200th career win when Chicago beats Washington at
Griffith Stadium, 9-2. The future Hall of Famer, nicknamed Sunday Teddy for
his success on the Sabbath, will compile a 260-230 record during a 21-year
major league career, all with the White Sox.

The Dodgers announce contracts to install lights at Ebbets Field. The first
night game will be played there on June 15th.

1941
A smart play by the Reds' Lonny Frey helps Cincy to a 6-4 win over the
Giants. With one out and the sacks full in the 1st, Chuck Aleno hits a DP
grounder to short. Frey, running from 2B, allows the ball to hit him for
an out, stopping play and putting Aleno on 1B. Ernie Lombardi then hits a
grand slam. Frank McCormick adds a 2-run HR in the 3rd.

1942
Ted Williams is sworn into the U.S. Navy, but will remain with the Red Sox
until he is called for active duty. Earlier in the year, a public outcry
occurred when the Boston outfielder was reclassified from Class 1-A to
3-A due to being the sole support for his mother causing the Quaker Oats
Company to drop him from their ads.

1944
The Cincinnati Clowns of the Negro American League defeat the Great Lakes
Naval Center Negro team 7-5.

1946
With the score tied 1-1 in the 10th inning at Ebbets Field, Cubs SS Len
Merullo and Dodger 2B Eddie Stanky start punching each other, precipitating
a brawl between the 2 teams. Claude Passeau rips off Leo Durocher's jersey
before calm is restored. The Dodgers win 2-1 in 13 innings, collecting 11
hits off Johnny Schmidt, who goes the distance. Joe Hatten gives up 4 hits
in 12 innings, with Higbe pitching the last round.

At the refurbished stadium in Detroit, the Yankees overcome a first inning
three-run homer by Hank Greenberg to subdue the Tigers, 5-3. The Yanks stop
an 8th inning rally with a triple play, started on a grounder to 1B by Dick
Wakefield. The all-tag TP is the first in Briggs Stadium history. The Tigers
turn four DPs to keep the game close.

1947
The Pirates beat the Braves, 4-3, as both teams combine for 22 hits -
all singles. The Pirates have 12.

1949
Brooklyn's Don Newcombe, 23, (according to the later baseball encyclopedias
... 25, according to Who's Who in Baseball) makes his first ML start a
dandy, shutting out the Reds, 3-0 in Cincinnati. It's the first shutout in
a National League debut in eleven years and extends Brooklyn's win streak
at Cincinnati to 19 games going back to June of 1947. Newk gives up hits to
the first 2 batters, then allows just 3 more hits while walking none. He
drives in 2 runs as well. Ken Raffensberger then matches Newk by firing a
one-hitter to beat Brooklyn, 2-0, tossing only 83 pitches. The only hit
is a leadoff single by Gil Hodges in the 8th. Raffensberger pitched two
one-hitters against the Dodgers in 1948.

1952
The Celler committee finds legislation for government control of baseball
to be unnecessary. It says that the sport can solve its own problems,
and opposes legislation exempting the reserve clause from antitrust laws.

1953
Yanks OF Irv Noren ends the game by lining back to P Bob Porterfield,
who starts a triple play, as the Senators beat the Yankees 12-4. The Nats
score five in the 1st inning off Allie Reynolds. Washington tallies 18 hits
including a 3-run homer and 2-run double by Clyde Vollmer. Johnny Mize hits
a pinch single in the 9th, his 5th pinch single in a row, breaking a mark
set by Cleveland's Les Fleming in 1947. Mize has had a walk and been hit
by a pitch in his last 7 pinch appearances.

The Red Sox add two more 3-2 wins to move within 2 1/2 games of the
Yankees. Unbeaten Mel Parnell wins his 6th in the opener as George Kell
homers and singles in the winner. The Red Sox take the nitecap in 12 innings
as Freeman beats Carl Scheib.

1954
Due to Reds' manager Birdie Tebbetts implementing a four-man outfield against
Stan Musial, the boxscore for the contest shows left-handed thrower, Nino
Escalera, coming into game as a shortstop. In reality, although Escalera
replaced infielder Roy McMillian, the rookie manager stationed him in
right-center between Cardinal outfielders Wally Post and Gus Bell. After
all that, Art Fowler strikes out Musial to end the game as the Reds win 4-2.

At Yankee Stadium, Allie Reynolds tosses a 7-hit shutout over the Red Sox
to win 7-0. Mantle is the offense, going 4 for 5 with 4 RBIs. Mick will
knock in 10 runs in the 3-game series against the Red Sox.

1955
The 2nd game of a Giants-Pirates doubleheader is called at the top of the
9th due to rain, 28 minutes short of the Sunday curfew, with the Giants
leading 5-3. If the rain had started before the end of the 8th, the game
would have gone to the Pirates by a score of 3-2. The umpires almost ruled
it a suspended game rather than a called game, because they felt they had
to wait at least half an hour before calling a game, which would set the
time 2 minutes after the curfew. But a Giants vice president finds the rule
that puts weather and similar conditions first when determining whether a
game is called or suspended.

1956
Detroit's Red Wilson belts a two run HR in the bottom of the 9th to give
the Tigers a 3-2 win against the Yankees. The loss goes to Whitey Ford,
his first following 6 wins. Ford had given up just 5 earned runs through
54 innings before today.

1957
At Fenway Park, the Red Sox go deep four times in the sixth inning in an
11-0 rout over Cleveland. Gene Mauch, Ted Williams, Dick Gernert and Frank
Malzone all homer on the first 16 pitches thrown by Cal McLish.

1958
Ted Williams hits his 16th career grand slam to provide the Red Sox with
the margin of victory in an 8-5 win over the A's. Ted's 4th-inning blast,
off Urban, ties him with Ruth for 2nd place on the career slam list.

1959
At Memorial Stadium, Baltimore's Hoyt Wilhelm one-hits the Yankees 5-0,
with Jerry Lumpe's single in the 8th the spoiler. Switch hitter Mantle hits
righty against Wilhelm and does no better than he has been lefty. On May 28,
Wilhelm will beat the Yankees again, 5-0.

1960
With Colavito on the bench because of poor hitting, the Tigers sweep the
visiting Red Sox, 6-2 and 5-2. Boston has now lost 9 straight and extend
that to 10 games before winning. Bunning and Aguirre notch the wins, as
the Hubmen strand 15 runners in the nitecap.

1962
At Yankee Stadium, Roger Maris, who went all of 1961 without receiving an
intentional walk, gets 4 in a 12-inning 2-1 win against the Angels to set
an AL record. The quartet of free passes is issued by four different Halo
hurlers. Maris receives 5 walks in all. Four Yankee pitchers (Whitey Ford,
Jim Coates, Bud Daley and Bob Turley) combine to give up just one hit in
12 innings. Ford leaves after 7 innings because of back spasms, and Coates
gives up the lone hit, a one-out 9th-inning single to Bob Rodgers. It is
the 2nd time this month that a Yankee combination attempt at a no hitter
gets spoiled in the 9th.

1963
The all-time shortest managerial career ends after one game - a loss -
when Eddie Yost, who replaced Mickey Vernon (14-26) as the Senators' pilot,
is replaced by Gil Hodges. Hodges was acquired today from the Mets, who
received veteran Jimmy Piersall.

Los Angeles' Don Drysdale beats the Mets 7-3 on two hits - homers by Duke
Snider and Tim Harkness.

At Yankee Stadium, New York blows a 7-0 lead and allows Kansas City to
tie the game and send it into extra innings. Mantle, leading off the 11th,
is fooled by Bill Fischer on a slow curve, then cannons a 2-2 pitch that
almost clears the RF roof. "The hardest ball I ever hit," Mantle later
comments, a ball that, by some accounts, was still rising when it struck a
foot below the top. It is conservatively estimated by Dr. James McDonald,
a physicist who studies long-ball trajectories, that the ball would have
traveled 620 feet if it had not struck the facade. "That was the only homer
I ever hit that the bat actually bent in my hands," Mantle tells Dale Long,
from whom he borrowed the bat.

1964
Baltimore edges the Twins 6-5, scoring 2 runs in the 9th for the
victory. Twins reliever Jerry Arrigo allows a 2-out HR to Sam Bowens, his
2nd HR of the game, then throws three balls to John Orsino before being
lifted for Bill Fischer. Fischer throws a strike to Orsino who then hits
his next pitch for the winning HR. It is Fischer's last ML throw. On the
24th he is placed on the voluntarily retired list.

1965
The Pirates and Giants trade infielders, Dick Schofield going to San
Francisco and Jose Pagan to Pittsburgh. The Pirates come out ahead on the
trade as Pagan will spend 7 years with the Bucs.

1968
At Wrigley Field, Pirates slugger Willie Stargell hits three homeruns and
just misses a fourth in a 13-6 rout over the Cubs. 'Pops' also hit a single
and a double which bounced off the railing of the left field fence back
onto the playing field.

The Cards fall 2-0, as Dodger Don Drysdale's streak reaches 3 consecutive
scoreless games. Bob Gibson is the loser.

1976
Reggie Smith drives in five runs in the Cardinals' 7-6 victory over
Philadelphia at Veterans Stadium. The St. Louis switch-hitter's 3rd round
tripper is a solo shot with 2 out in the 9th inning off Tug McGraw to give
Al Hrabosky the win.

The Reds thrash the Padres, 11-0, as George Foster drives in 5 runs.

1977
The Red Sox split a doubleheader with the Brewers, winning the opener
14-10. The 2 teams tie a ML record in game one when they combine for 11
HRs, 6 by Boston. Dwight Evans clocks one of the homers over the new upper
section of the CF wall, about 20 feet to the right of the flagpole, one
of the longest homers hit at Fenway. Also in the 7-run 8th, George Scott
booms a grand slam. In the past 3 games, the two teams hit 23 homers. Eddie
Rodriguez stops the slugging in game 2, allowing 2 Boston hits to win,
6-0. Milwaukee has 18 hits and 16 LOB. Fergie Jenkins gives up all the runs
in 6+ innings. The 11 homeruns in game 1 tie a major league record. The
round-tripper riot matches the mark set by the Yankees and Tigers in 1950
and equalled by the Cubs and Mets in 1967.

In Seattle's 6-2 win over Oakland, Mariner's catcher Skip Jutze is twice
caught stealing home, likely tying a ML record. Jutze will end his ML career
with one steal and 6 CS. The battery of Vida Blue and Eddie Williams catch
3 runners trying to steal home, 2 in the 4th.

Ron Guidry stops a 3-game Yankee losing streak with a 4-hitter to defeat
the Orioles, 8-2.

1981
Billy Gardner, a very successful minor league skipper, winning six
championships in 13 seasons, gets his first opportunity to manage a big league
club. He replaces the fired John Goryl as manager of the Twins. Minnesota
(11-25) had lost 8 consecutive games, but shuts out Kansas City 7-0 in
Gardner's managerial debut.

With Rick Waits on the mound in the 6th, the Yankees' Bucky Dent hits into
a triple play. But the Yankees win, 3-2, with the margin a 2-run HR by Dave
Winfield. The win goes to Dave Righetti (1-0).

1982
In his last major league at-bat, Mario Mendoza, who will become a minor
league hitting instructor, reaches first on a fielder's choice ending his
nine-year career with a .215 batting average. The Ranger infielder's name
will become infamous as players struggling at the plate will be described
as performing below the 'Mendoza Line'.

1983
Cliff Johnson ties Jerry Lynch's major league mark when he hits the 18th
pinch homerun of his career. The eighth inning solo shot comes off Tippy
Martinez in the Blue Jays' 5-0 victory over Baltimore at Exhibition Stadium.

The Phillies make a pair of trades, sending P Sid Monge to the Padres for
OF Joe Lefebvre and P Dick Ruthven and minor leaguer Bill Johnson to the
Cubs for P Willie Hernandez.

1988
Pedro Guerrero throws his bat at David Cone after being hit by a pitch in
the Dodgers' 5-2 loss to the Mets and will be suspended for 4 games by NL
president Bart Giamatti.

1990
During the Cubs' 2-1 victory against the Reds in a 16-inning contest at
Wrigley Field, Andre Dawson is walked five times intentionally to set a
major league record. The previous mark of four free passes in a game was
established by Yankees outfielder Roger Maris in 1962 and then equaled by
Padres shortstop Gerry Templeton in 1985. In today's game Cincinnati issues
7 intentional passes altogether to tie a ML record set by Houston in 1984.

1991
Manager John Wathan is fired by the Royals. He will be replaced by Hal McRae.

Oakland reliever Dennis Eckersley picks off Toronto pinch runner Kenny
Williams in the 9th of a 2-1 A's victory. Eck's last pickoff occurred 4 years
ago when, on June 29, 1987, he picked off a White Sox runner. Kenny Williams!

1992
Felipe Alou becomes the manager of the Expos replacing Tom Runnells. The
new skipper will lead the 17-20 Montreal club to an eventual second-place
finish in the National League east.

1993
Cardinal minor leaguer Diego Ruiz is killed and teammate Eddie Williams is
injured when their car slams into a cement pole. Williams, a catcher with
Springfield (Midwest League), is the driver.

B.J. Birdie, mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays, is ejected from Toronto's game
against Minnesota by umpire Jim McKean after holding his nose on a call. The
Blue Jays win 7-0 over the Twins as 5 Jay pitchers record 15 strikeouts. Danny
Cox (4-0), in relief of Stottlemyre in the 3rd, is the winner. Devon White
has a single, double, homer and stolen base to pace the offense.

1994
Kansas City P David Cone hurls a 1-hit 4-0 shutout over the Angels. Chili
Davis' opposite-field single in the 5th inning is California's only safety.

1995
After a brawl between the Durham Bulls and Winston Salem Warthogs, which
takes more than 30 minutes to sort out, ten players are ejected during
'Strike Out Domestic Violence Night' at Durham Bulls Athletic Park.
Winston-Salem P Glen Cullop is knocked unconscious in the melee. The
president of the Carolina League will hand down 124 days of suspensions
which will include every player in uniform for some period of time. Also,
a total of $6,000 in fines is levied.

1996
The Athletics spoil Dwight Gooden Day in New York City by hitting 5 solo
homers - three by Yankee-killer Geronimo Berroa - to beat the Yankees
5-1. The 5 runs, all coming on homers, ties the ML mark.

Albert Belle's 21-game hit streak is stopped when, with two men on, he strikes
out in the 9th inning to end the game, a 10-8 Cleveland loss to the Brewers.

1997
The visiting Red Sox collect 19 hits, but strand 16, in beating the Yankees,
8-2. Former Yankee Mike Stanley hits a three-run homer, and Wil Cordero
adds 5 hits, Tim Naehring has 4 hits and Mo Vaughn belts his 10th homer of
the season in the 8th.

San Diego P Joey Hamilton homers and Tony Gwynn has three hits off Hideo
Nomo as the San Diego Padres top the Dodgers, 4-1. It is the Pads' seventh
straight win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Gwynn, whose wife, Alicia,
is being sued by Nomo, goes 3 for 4 to raise his average to .387. Nomo
sued Alicia Gwynn last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming the
unauthorized use of his name and picture in a jigsaw puzzle.

1998
The Mets trade Preston Wilson, Geoff Goetz and Ed Yarnell to the Marlins
for Mike Piazza. Florida had acquired the all-star catcher last week from
the Dodgers along with Todd Zeille in exchange for Gary Sheffield, Bobby
Bonilla, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich and Manuel Barrios. Piazza will
be the first player to have a 100-RBI season while playing with three teams.

Brian Cox enjoys a 6 for 6 performance, that includes a grand slam in the
team's ten-run third inning, when Florida State demolishes Delaware 27-6
in the NCAA Atlantic II Regionals. Matt Diaz, a freshman for the Seminoles,
contributes three homeruns to the rout of the Fighin' Blue Hens.

1999
After a stint on the disabled list and a rain out, Yankee right-hander Roger
Clemens finally breaks the American League record for consecutive victories
with 18, previously shared by Johnny Allen (Indians, 1936-37) and Dave McNally
(Orioles, 1968-69). The somewhat anticlimactic accomplishment includes ten
no-decisions. The Yankees defeat the White Sox, 10-2, in the 1st game of
the DH. The White Sox come back to take the 2nd game by a score of 2-1.

Mo Vaughn's single in the 8th snaps a tie and rescues Steve Sparks' wild
knuckler as the Angels beat the Devil Rays, 8-6. In the 3rd inning, Sparks
hits Paul Sorrento to load the bases, then plunks the next 2 batters with a
knuckler. He is the 4th pitcher to hit 3 batters in a row, joining Houston's
C.J. Nitkowski (1998), White Sox Wilbur Wood (1977) and Pittsburgh's Dock
Ellis (1974). He also plunks Jose Canseco in the 1st inning to tie the ML
mark for HBP. Sparks only allows 5 hits, but walks 6 in addition to hitting 4.

Reds P Pete Harnisch hits his 1st ML HR and hurls his 2nd shutout of the
season, 3-0, over San Diego.

2000
The Brewers defeat the Astros in the 1st game of a DH, 10-9, coming back
from a 9-2 deficit to tie the score with 7 runs in the bottom half of the
9th inning before only 3,913 fans at County Stadium. It is a club record
rally for the 9th inning. They win the game in the 10th on a HR by Jose
Hernandez. Milwaukee also wins the 2nd game of the twinbill, 6-1.

2001
The Giants lose to the Diamondbacks, 12-8, despite Barry Bonds' 9th HR
in the last 6 games establishing a National League mark. His streak of 6
straight games with homers is his 2nd of the season. Mark Grace has 4 hits,
including 2 doubles. Senators slugger Frank Howard's 1968 feat of hitting
10 homers in six games is the major league record.

The Twins score 8 runs in the 3rd inning to give Brad Radke an 8-0 lead,
then hold on to edge the Mariners, 12-11. The M's will use the momentum to
win their next 15 and set a franchise record.

2002
In what appears to be a lopsided trade, the A's trade a stunned Jeremy Giambi
(.274, 8, 17) to Philadelphia in exchange for pinch hitter John Mabry (.286,
0, 3). The Oakland outfielder is also four years younger than the Phillies'
utility man, but he doesn't meet the 'Moneyball' approach preached by GM
Billy Beane. Giambi will homer in his first 2 Philley at-bats on the 25th,
and be the first player in major-league history to hit eight homers in each
league before the All-Star break. He'll finish the year with 20. That, plus
Jason's 41, will give the Giambi boys the record for homers by brothers in the
same season, topping the 59 hit in 1937 by Joe (46) and Vince DiMaggio (13).

Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura approves a financing framework for a $330
million open-air stadium. The bill is the result of a seven-year effort by
the Twins to secure help from the state, but the plan has only tepid support
from the club because team officials are unsure if they'll be able to find
$120 million for a required down payment and get a guarantee from major
league baseball that a team will play in Minnesota for at least 30 years.

The Tigers defeat the Indians, 2-0, on Jeff Weaver's 1-hitter. OF Chris
Magruder's double with 2 outs in the 8th inning in his Cleveland debut is
the Tribe's only safety.

Behind Shawn Green's RBI triple, the Dodgers beat the Brewers, 1-0. Green
also throws out Jenkins at home to complete a DP. Hideo Nomo pitches 6
innings to earn the win.

The Wichita Wranglers (Texas L) score 14 runs in the 3rd in beating Tulsa,
19-2. They set league records for singles (10) in an inning, and by having
16 straight players reach base. Five players make 2 hits in the inning.

2003
Arturo Moreno purchases the World Champion Angels from Walt Disney for $184
million to become the third owner in the 43-year history of the franchise. The
56-year-old outdoor advertising tycoon, a fourth-generation Mexican-American,
is the first Hispanic to have a controlling interest in a major league club.

Down 5-3 to the Cleveland Indians going into the bottom of the 9th,
the Seattle Mariners score 5 runs off Tribe reliever Danys Baez to win,
8-5. Mariners centerfielder Mike Cameron's no-out walkoff grand slam caps
the scoring.

2004
Oakland retires Reggie Jackson's jersey number 9 honoring the slugger who
played his first nine Hall of Fame seasons with the A's helping the club
capture three-consecutive World Series (1972-74). The former Athletics'
right fielder, who had his number 44 retired by the Yankees in 1993,
becomes the eighth player to have his number retired by two or more teams.

2005
The Twins score 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th off Derrick Turnbow to
tie the Brewers at 5 apiece. Shannon Stewart's homer is the big blow. The
Twins then win in 11 innings, 6-5. Lew Ford has 3 hits and 3 runs including
the game-winner. Minnesota ties their team record with 17 strikeouts in an
extra inning game. The mark was set in 1987.

2006
Jake Peavy establishes a Padres record by striking out 16 Braves (in only 7
innings) and helps the team set a franchise mark for strike outs in a nine
inning game with 18. The 24-year-old right hander from Alabama loses the
game, 3-1, as the only fly ball he allows lands on the other side of the
fence when Ryan Langerhans takes him deep for a two-run homer in the second.

The Dodgers defeat the Rockies, 6-1. LA's Jae Seo and Colorado's Byung-Hyun
Kim become the first Korean-born starting pitchers to meet in a ML game.

2008
J.D. Drew and Mike Lowell both hit grand slams when the Red Sox beat Kansas
City, 11-8. Daisuke Matsuzaka, who gives up three runs in 5 1/3 innings,
remains unbeaten improving his record to 8-0 with the Fenway Park victory.

2009
With a broken-bat triple in the sixth inning, Michael Cuddyer completes
his cycle in the Twins' 11-3 victory over Milwaukee at the Metrodome. In
his first three turns at-bat, the Minnesota right-fielder hit a three-run
homerun in the first inning, doubled to the gap for a ground rule two-bagger
in the third and singled in the fourth frame.

2010
After setting the mark in his previous game, Mike Redmond's major league
record errorless-streak behind the the plate comes to an end when his throw
to second base, trying to thwart a would-be base stealer, skips past Mark
Grudzielanek. The Diamondbacks catcher's streak started on July 22, 2004
and covered a span of 253 games.

Matt Stairs ties a major league mark when he homers for his eleventh team
in San Diego's 2-1 interleague victory in Seattle. The Padres designated
hitter's fourth inning homer off Ian Snell ties Todd Zeile's record, who
accomplished the feat by going deep in an Expo uniform in 2003.

2012
Ricky Nolasco becomes the franchise leader in career wins when Miami beats
Colorado at Marlins Park, 7-6. The 29-year-old right-hander, who hit a
double to put his team ahead, surpasses Dontrelle Willis for the most team
victories, improving his record to 69-53 for the South Florida squad.

2014
Barack Obama becomes the first U.S. president to visit the National
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown. During his visit, the
Commander-in-Chief, a White Sox fan, holds FDR's green-light letter declaring
that baseball should continue during World War II and a pair of spikes worn
by Chicago's "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, who was one of the eight players banned
from the game for their alleged role in fixing the 1919 World Series.

2019
The Yankees became the first team in Major League history to hit at least
three homeruns in six consecutive games in the same ballpark (Oriole Park
at Camden Yards).
