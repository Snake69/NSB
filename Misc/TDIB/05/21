May 21

1901
Giants fractious owner Andrew Freedman accuses umpire Billy Nash of
incompetence and bars him from the Polo Grounds. Pirate Chief Zimmer and
the Giants' John Warner are forced to officiate. Mathewson then wins his
7th straight, 2-1, but his scoreless streak stops at 39 innings when the
Bucs score an unearned run in the 9th.

1902
At Pittsburgh, the Giants top the leading Pirates, 5-2, with Christy
Mathewson winning in relief. Matty takes over for Dummy Taylor in the 7th,
allows a tying run to score, then scores the winning run himself in the 8th.

1904
Boston (AL) SS Bill O'Neill puts himself in the record books by committing
6 errors in a 13-inning 5-3 loss to the Browns. O'Neill makes errors in the
first inning on the first three balls hit to him, and a 4th straight error
with a misplay in the 2nd frame. His final error is on an easy grounder
in the 13th inning and allows two runs to score. O'Neill is the only 20th
century player to record 6 errors.

1906
An 11-game win streak by Philadelphia is stopped by Cleveland, 2-1, in 13
innings. The Athletics, Cleveland Naps and New York Highlanders juggle the
top spot in AL standings.

The White Sox win their 5th in a row, 7-6, over the Highlanders. The win
goes to Doc White, his first since returning from coaching the Georgetown
College team.

Before a packed house in Chicago, the Giants' Hooks Wiltse, with relief
help from Mathewson, stops the league-leading Cubs, 6-4. Mathewson allows
one run in his 4 innings. The Giants will win tomorrow as well.

1907
NL president Pulliam dismisses the Opening Day protests of Pittsburgh
manager Fred Clarke over Bresnahan's shin guards. As yet, Bresnahan is the
only catcher using them.

Three Finger Brown and Christy Mathewson hook up in a pitching duel, with the
Chicago ace emerging the victor, 3-2. Matty's batterymate Roger Bresnahan
makes 2 errors to cause Christy Mathewson to lose his 1st of the year. The
loss drops the Giants out of first place. Mobbed at the Polo Grounds after
the loss, umpires O'Day and Emslie require police protection. The crowd is
egged on by McGraw, who will be thrown out of games 7 times this year. The
next day AL ump Billy Evans needs a police escort after argumentative Hugh
Jennings incites a riot. Jennings will be suspended.

1908
Pitching for Kansas City (Western Association) Smoky Joe Wood hurls a 1-0
no-hitter against Milwaukee.

1909
In Boston, Cubs P Orval Overall (8-2) allows 2 hits and strikes out 8 in
beating Boston, 7-0. His batterymate Pat Moran has a triple and a homer
off losing P Al Mattern, one of 20 losses he'll have this year.

1912
Bill Malarkey of Oakland (PCL) allows no hits for 9 innings before being
touched for a single in the 10th against San Francisco. The game ends in
a scoreless tie because of a time limit.

1913
The Browns top the Yankees, 5-0, as young Earl Hamilton throws a
one-hitter. Birdie Cree has the lone hit. Hamilton will do it again on
July 15.

The Pirates top the Dodgers, 5-2, and (according to Greg Beston of Retrosheet)
set a ML record for most sacrifies (4) in an inning. It happens in the 8th
when Jim Viox singles, Honus Wagner sac bunts but is safe on a throwing
error, Dots Miller does the same, Owen Wilson sac bunts them to 3B and
Bobby Byrne hits a squeeze sac bunt for a score.

In New York, Yankees owner Frank Farrell declares that the team will not
return to Bermuda next year for spring training. The warm weather and
humidty caused a reaction when the players returned to the cold weather.

Alva "Rip" Williams lives up to his nickname as he hits a 2-run pinch
homer in the 9th for Washington to tie Cleveland, 2-2. It's Rip's first ML
homer. The Senators score 2 in the top of the 10th and send Walter Johnson
in to preserve the 4-2 win.

1914
Boston's Lefty Tyler beats the Cubs, 2-1.

1915
The Red Sox and White Sox battle for 17 innings at Comiskey Park, before
Chicago prevails, 3-2. Red Faber wins his 7th straight, beating Carl Mays,
who takes over in the 8th.

1917
The Phillies use 9 hits - one by each starter - to beat the Cubs, 4-3,
and drop the Cubs from first to third. The Phils move into 2nd place behind
the Giants. Eppa Rixey is the winner for the Quakers.

The Giants take over first place with a 4-3 win over the Pirates behind
the pitching of Big Jeff Tesreau and the favorable umpiring of Kitty
Bransfield. Tesreau allows just two hits through 8 innings before weakening
in the 9th. Kitty makes an out call in the 9th on a grounder that 3B Doug
Baird clearly appears to beat, and in the 2nd inning ignores Art Fletcher's
failure to return to 3rd before scoring on a sac fly. Fletcher had taken
a 15-foot lead.

1919
The Giants trade outfielder Jim Thorpe to the Braves for hurler Pat Ragan,
who will pitch only in seven games for New York. The former Olympian,
who only appeared in two games with his former team this year, will play
60 games for Boston before retiring at the end of the campaign, compiling
a career .252 batting average during his six seasons in the major leagues.

The Phils push over 6 runs in the 9th to beat the visiting Cardinals,
8-7. Birds starter Marv Goodwin is lifted in the 9th with one out and 2 on,
while Willie Sherdel is banged for the loss.

1923
Formal transfer of T. L. Huston's interest in the Yankees to Jake Ruppert
is completed for $1.5 million. Ten days later Ruppert buys 2 more sets of
uniforms so his players can wear a clean outfit every day, an unprecedented
move.

1925
At Navin Field, behind the hitting (3 for 4) and pitching of Johnson, the
Senators tame the Tigers 6-2. The two teams combine for 9 double plays,
setting a record (since tied) for a 9-inning game. The Reds and Braves will
turn a record 10 double plays in 12 innings on June 7.

In Brooklyn, Hack Miller pinch-hits in the top of the 9th and triples home
Sparky Adams with the Cubs 4th run. But Brooklyn still wins 5-4. It is
Miller's last appearance for the Cubs, who will release him on the 24th
and he will sign with the Oakland Oaks.

A's rookie Mickey Cochrane hits three homers to lead Philadelphia to a 20-4
rout over the Browns. His first two clouts come off Milt Gaston, and the third
off George Blaeholder. He will hit just another two all year to total six.

1926
Earl Sheely ties a big league record (set by Elmer Smith in 1921) with seven
consecutive extra-base hits. After doubling in each of his last three at-bats
at Fenway Park yesterday, the White Sox first baseman collects three doubles
and a homerun in today's 8-7 loss to Boston. Chicago won yesterday, 13-4.

1927
The Cubs move into first place in the NL when a 9-run 9th inning gives them
an 11-6 win and doubleheader sweep at Brooklyn. Chicago takes the opener,
6-4. For the second day in a row, a disputed call - this one by Frank Wilson
- causes fans to stop the game. Meanwhile, the Pirates are beating New York
for the 3rd straight game, 5-3.

It is George Burns Day in Cleveland as he is presented with a diploma as
the MVP of 1926, a silver bat, $1,150 in cash and an automobile. Burns has
a pair of doubles but the visiting Yankees win 6-4 in 12 innings.

1930
Babe Ruth hits three consecutive HRs in the first game of a doubleheader
against the A's, then batting against Jack Quinn in the 9th, Ruth decides to
hit right handed. After 2 strikes, he switches to lefty but strikes out. This
is the first of two career 3-homer games for the Babe. Max Bishop draws 5
walks for the 2nd time in his career (he is the only player to do this twice),
and Foxx homers to help the A's to a 15-7 victory. Ruth is homerless in the
2nd game, a 4-1 Yankee loss, but Bishop has 3 more walks. Bishop will walk
8 times in a doubleheader in 1934, the only player to collect more than 6
walks in an afternoon.

Cincinnati sends 2B Hugh Critz to the Giants for veteran P Larry Benton. Critz
will prove a fine pickup for the Giants.

1931
Dazzy Vance is knocked cold by a line drive while leading the Phillies 3-2
with 2 outs in the 9th inning. Jack Quinn gets the last out for Brooklyn.

Fitzsimmons, who is struck in the back by a fungo bat while warming up. Fat
Freddie will miss several starts.

1935
Promising pitcher Buck Newsom is sold by the Browns to the Senators for
$40,000.

The A's acquire P George Blaeholder, who won 10 or more games in each of the
last 7 seasons, from the Browns for Ed Coleman and Sugar Cain. Blaeholder
had one of the highest salaries on the cash-poor Browns. Coleman will set
the AL record for pinch hits this year with 20 ... Dave Philley will break
it in 1961.

With Babe Ruth leading the way with a homerun, the Braves beat the Cubs,
4-1. Fred Frankhouse is the winner over Tex Carleton.

Pirates on orders from Commissioner Landis.

1943

nine-inning game ever played in the American League.

1944
The Giants split with the Cardinals, losing 10-3 and then winning the 2nd
game 7-5. Mel Ott has a HR, triple, 2 doubles and a single in the two games,
and puts himself in at 3B in the nitecap. Jurges moves from 3B to short,
replacing Buddy Kerr.

1945
After a twinbill yesterday in New York, the 2 teams play today in Pittsburgh
with the Pirates winning their 2nd straight, 5-2. Ernie Lombardi hits 2
homers for the Giants scores.

Blackwell, the Whip loses his snap. The Dodgers then score 15 runs in the
first inning as a NL record 19 consecutive batters reach 1B (10 hits, 7
BB and 2 HBP). Captain Pee Wee Reese walks twice in reaching base safely 3
times. Andy Pafko is thrown out trying to steal 3B, and Duke Snider mercifully
strikes out to end the barrage against the Reds. The Dodgers score 15 runs on
15 RBIs in the frame, and coast at home, 19-1. Winning pitcher Chris Van Cuyk
has the most hits with four - two in the first inning off Bud Byerly and Frank
Smith - while Bobby Morgan has a pair of two-run homers and Snider another
two-run homer. The Reds lone run is a homer by reserve catcher Dixie Howell.

trapped off 1B but his way back to the bag is obstructed by first baseman
Vernon ... it is called by 2B ump Ed Runge but he makes no gestures and Jensen
continues back to 1B. McDermott, waiting to put the tag on, is knocked over by
Jensen, and Hank Soar at 1B calls the runner out. Soar is overruled and then
the fight starts between Jensen and the pitcher and both are tossed. Pedro
Ramos, who succeeds McDermott, draws a walk and scores the winning run.

1956
The White Sox send 3B George Kell, OF Bob Nieman and pitchers Mike Fornieles
and Connie Johnson to the Orioles for P Jim Wilson and OF Dave Philley. Kell
will play a solid 3B until Brooks Robinson is ready, while Johnson will
lead the Birds' starters in wins in 1957.

At Kansas City, Mantle clouts a drive over the 2nd, and more distant,
fence in RF to help the Yankees win, 8-5. The drive, off Moe Burtschy,

press box, Boston baseball writers deny a seat to Doris O'Donnell, a feature
writer following the Indians.

major league status within the present baseball structure by an acceptable
group of eight clubs which would qualify under ten specifications." Frick
foresees the formation of a 3rd league within 5 years.

1962
The Tribe keeps pounding but lose 10-7 to Baltimore. Three more Cleveland

1970
A generous Mel Stottlemyre hands out 11 walks to Washington in 8 1/3 innings,
but the Senators are unable to score. Steve Hamilton gets the last 2 outs to
preserve the 2-0 win. The 11 walks in a shutout ties Lefty Gomez, who did
complete his 1941 shutout. Danny Cater's 2-run homer in the 5th accounts

National League West title.

1977
Merv Rettenmund hits a 3-run HR in the 21st inning to give the Padres an

Larry Walker powers the Rockies to a 12-10 win over the Pirates by driving
in 6 runs and scoring 4. Walker connects for 2 homeruns, a triple and a
double as Colorado tallies 20 hits. Tomorrow, Walker will get a double,
triple, and triple to set a new NL record by getting extra-base hits in
six straight plate appearances (i.e., with no intervening bases on balls,
hit-by-pitch or sacrifice bunts). The AL record is 7 with walks or sac fly in
between. Earlier today, before the double/triple/homer, but not consecutive
to them, he had already hit a homerun. By doing so, he will tie the major
league record for most extra-base hits (seven) in two consecutive games.

homeruns to pace the Haloes to a 5-2 win over the Orioles.

The Phils' Terry Mulholland defeats the Padres, 5-4. Mulholland, who entered
the game with the 3rd-lowest batting average in history of any player with
400 at-bats, clouts a 407-foot HR in the 2nd inning off Sean Bergman. As
Mulholland explains, "Most great power hitters don't hit for a high average."

1997

year against no losses. The Rocket wins his 200th, the 94th pitcher to
reach 200 wins.

1998
Professional baseball returns to Bridgeport, Connecticut for the first time
in nearly half a century when the hometown Bluefish beat the Newport Bears

Beltre and Shawn Green (Dodgers) all contributing to the record. The NL
also set a league record blasting four of the six base-loaded homers.

and teammate J.T. Snow hits a grand slam in the sixth. Starter Russ Ortiz
is the winner, allowing 10 earned runs, the most earned runs allowed by
a pitcher in a win since Bob Friend, in 1954. The last pitcher to notch a
win and give up 10 runs - 9 earned - was the Giants' Vida Blue against the
Padres on April 19, 1979. The Giants are the second team to score 11 runs
in an inning this year. Earlier this season, the White Sox dropped 11 runs
against the Seattle Mariners in one inning.

Trailing the Dodgers 6-0, the Brewers score 8 times in the 7th inning to
pull out an 8-6 victory.

The Devil Rays defeat the Mariners, 1-0, behind Joe Kennedy's 4-hitter. The

Juan Marichal by dedicating a nine-foot bronze statue outside SBC Park. The
'Dominican Dandy', a San Francisco hurler from 1960-1973, joins Willie Mays
and Willie McCovey as the third player to be honored.

The Rangers explode for 8 runs in the 2nd inning on their way to an 18-3
win over the Astros. Mark Teixeira, Rod Barajas, Hank Blalock and Laynce
Nix all homer in the frame to tie a club record.

The Braves score 6 runs off starter Tim Wakefield and beat the Red Sox,
7-5. Rookie Kyle Davies wins in his ML debut, the first Brave pitcher to
do so since David Nied debuted on Spetember 1, 1992.

The Mets batter Randy Johnson for 9 hits in 3+ innings and beat the Yankees,
7-1. Kris Benson pitches into the 7th inning before being lifted for Dae-Sung
Koo. Koo K's two and then in the bottom of the inning hits a double over
Bernie Williams' head in CF. Koo goes to 3rd on a sac bunt and continues home
when Posada is late covering the plate and scores sliding. Koo later admits
he has not been on base in nearly 20 years. With Koo batting against Randy
Johnson, Mike Piazza confides to David Wright in the dugout, "If he gets a
hit, I'll donate a million dollars to charity." The Korean reliever batting
lefty against the Yankee fire-balling southpaw, who was afraid to stand in
the batter's box in a previous game, promptly hits a 91-mph fastball to
the wall in center for a double causing the Mets catcher to remark he'll
be making a significant donation to a charity over the next 20 years.

2006
The Giants down the Athletics, 6-0, behind rookie Matt Cain's
1-hitter. Oakland's only hit is a 3rd inning 2B by Jay Payton.

The Indians defeat the Pirates, 3-2, in 10 innings. Bob Wickman gets the
win in relief for Cleveland, his first win since August 10, 2002. The streak
of 105 games was the longest active stretch in the ML without a win.

2008
Willie Randolph apologizes for his negative remarks concerning SNY's coverage
of him as the Mets skipper. The team's first black manager had brought up
race when asked about the way he is being portrayed by the team's TV network.

2009
During a five-hour rain delay at Bright House Field in Clearwater, Florida,
UConn and South Florida players entertain the fans, and mostly themselves,
with an impromptu dance-off. When play resumes tomorrow, sixth-seeded
Connecticut will advance to the semifinal round of the Big East Championship
with a 4-2 victory over the No. 2-ranked USF Bulls.

2012
Rockies starter Jamie Moyer extends his major league record when he makes
his debut at the newly opened Marlins Park, having now pitched in 50 major
league ballparks. The 49-year-old southpaw started his career with a victory
for Philadelphia at Wrigley Field in 1986.

Cincinnati fan Caleb Lloyd catches both homerun balls hit in consecutive
at-bats, just three pitches apart, by starter Mike Leake and shortstop Zack
Cozart during the fourth inning of the Reds' 4-1 victory over Atlanta at
Great American Ballpark. The 20-year-old Thomas More College junior keeps
neither as he gives the infielder's ball to Nick Rise, a friend who had
helped get the tickets to the game, and, at the request of the Reds, gives
the pitcher, who hit his first career round-tripper, the other in exchange
for a tour of the Reds' clubhouse and an autographed bat and ball signed
by the grateful hurler.

2013
Mike Trout becomes the youngest player in American League history to hit for
the cycle when he goes 4 for 5 in the Angels' 12-0 rout of the Mariners. The
21-year-old 'Millville Meteor' beats out an infield single in the third,
triples in the fourth, doubles in the sixth and goes deep in the eighth to
become the sixth player in franchise history to accomplish the feat.

2014
The A's manage only one hit, a fourth-inning solo homerun from Brandon
Moss, but it is enough to beat Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field, 3-2, for their
fifth straight and 11th victory in its past 12 games. Oakland is the first
American League team to win with a homerun as its only hit since Jim Thome's
solo shot in 2006 gave the White Sox a 1-0 victory over the Cardinals at
U.S. Cellular Field.

2019
Zack Greinke recorded his 2,500th career strikeout by fanning Franmil Reyes
of the San Diego Padres. He became the 37th player to reach this mark.

The Orioles gave up their 100th homerun of the season, against the New
York Yankees. The Orioles pitching staff did it in 48 games, which was nine
games faster than the previous fastest held by the 2000 Kansas City Royals.

2021
The Atlanta Braves became the first team in Major League history to hit
seven or more homeruns and two grand slams in a single game against the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
