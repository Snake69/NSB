May 5

1901
At Milwaukee, the White Sox jump to a 4-1 lead over the Brewers before the
hosts roar back against Bob Patterson, scoring 8 runs in the 4th on their way
to a 21-7 win. The Sox make just three hits. Patterson, meanwhile faces 57
batters, 53 official at-bats - both 20th Century major league records for
9 innings - and is pasted for 25 hits. Patterson, the pitcher who won the
first AL game two weeks ago, will give up 345 hits this season, a distant
2nd to Baltimore's Joe McGinnity.

1904
Boston American Cy Young pitches the 2nd of 3 no-hitters, a 3-0 perfect
game against the Philadelphia Athletics and Rube Waddell. This is the first
perfect game in American League history and the first perfect game thrown in
the majors since the distance between the mound and plate was changed from 45
feet to 60 feet, six inches in 1893. After Waddell flied out for the final
out, Young yells at him, "How do you like that, you hayseed!" Waddell had
earlier in the season challenged Young to pitch against him. For Waddell it is
one of his 18 losses this year, the most of his career, against 25 wins. He
will strike out 349, a record until Sandy Koufax fans 382 in 1965. Today,
he strikes out 6 while allowing 10 hits. Young stretches his hitless inning
skein to 18.

The Giants break a 5-5 tie with Boston by scoring 5 runs in the 9th to pin
the loss on Togie Pittinger. Mathewson is the recipient of the offense,
winning his 4th.

At New York, the Washington Nationals notch their first win of the year
beating the Highlanders, 9-4, to snap their 13-game losing streak. This is
an AL record to start the season.

1906
Christy Mathewson makes his first mound appearance of the year for the
Giants. The New York ace is still weak from a case of diphtheria contracted
before the season. Matty pitches 7 innings against Boston and allows 7 hits
before being relieved by Joe McGinnity, who allows 3 runs in the 9th to turn a
4-3 margin into a 6-4 defeat. The Giants (15-5) stay in first place in the NL.

1909
The Pirates move into first place to stay in the NL. The Tigers will lead
all the way in the AL, except for one week in May and 2 in mid-August.

In a 5-2 win over the Reds, the Cubs Harry Steinfeldt drives in 3 runs on
3 sac flies.

Highlanders pitcher Lew Brockett records 9 assists in his 2-0 win over the
Boston Americans.

1910
P Cy Morgan and 2B Eddie Collins of the Athletics and P Dixie Walker and C
Gabby Street of the Senators handle all the assists in the 10-1 Philadelphia
victory.

1912
Dick Hoblitzel is 5 for 5 to pace the Reds to an 11-9 win over the host
St. Louis Cardinals. His hitting is needed as the Cards answer with a single,
double and triple from Ed Konetchy and a triple and two HRs from Rube Ellis.

1913
Red Sox player-manager Jake Stahl undergoes an operation to remove a bone
spur in his foot. Stahl will skip the team's western swing. Though he had 326
at-bats last year, Jake will only hit twice this year, his last as a player.

1915
The Giants finally beat Alexander, nipping the Phillies ace, 4-2. It's his
1st loss of the year.

1916
Red Sox pitcher Carl Mays relieves Ruth with the score 4-2 in the 9th against
New York. New York ties the game on a 2-out error by 3B Larry Gardner,
and wins in 13 innings, 8-4. Mays makes his first appearance of the year
following a tonsil operation in the spring.

1917
Thanks to the St. Louis scorer's decision to turn Buck Weaver's first inning
questionable hit into an error, Browns' hurler Ernie Koob throws a no-hitter
at Sportsman's Park. The southpaw beats Ed Cicotte and the White Sox, 1-0. The
first-inning tainted hit is changed to an error after much discussion with
umpires and players. Tomorrow, the writers' association will take a mail
vote on a resolution that a scorer's decision can not be reversed. Today's
shutout is the last the 24-year-old Weaver will toss. George Sisler drives
in the Browns' run.

1918
Long-time minor league manager Ned Egan is found dead from a self-inflicted
wound in a Chicago Hotel. Egan, signed as Milwaukee's manager for 1918,
had been depressed after suffering a spinal injury while skating this
past winter. He was known for winning more minor league pennants than any
other manager.

1919
Hod Eller and the Reds blow a 6-0 lead as the Cubs score 6 in the 9th to
tie. Chicago pushes across a run in the 12th to win, 7-6. The loss drops
the Reds out of 1st place in the NL.

Washington pitcher Jim Shaw hits a grand slam off A's starter Bob Johnson
in the 2nd to pace the Nats to a 10-7 win and a sweep in Philadelphia. Sam
Rice also homers in a rain-interrupted game finally called in the 9th inning.

1920
The Yankees beat Walter Johnson and the Senators, 7-1, racking up 11
hits. Only one of the runs off Johnson is earned as Carl Mays is the easy
winner. The Babe is 2 for 2, both doubles, draws two walks and drives
home two.

Chicago's Red Faber outpitches Stan Coveleski, but loses to the Indians
ace, 3-2. Faber's error allows the 2nd run and Happy Felsch's 9th inning
error allows the winner. Ray Chapman and Larry Gardner swipe bases for
the Tribe. Gardner will nab his season total of 3 in the first half of the
season, but continue to run. He'll be caught stealing twenty times.

1922
The Giants evict their AL tenants as of the end of the year, so the Yankees
sign a contract to build their own $750,000 stadium on a site they had held
an option on since 1920.

Pitching against the Tigers, the Browns' Bill Bayne takes a no-hitter into the
8th inning. Detroit manager Ty Cobb then sends up 5 straight pinch hitters,
the first of whom in the 9th breaks up the no-hitter. One of the pinch hitters
Cobb inserts is Bob Fothergill, who bats for Cobb and strikes out, but becomes
the only man ever to pinch hit for the Georgia Peach. The Browns win, 6-1.

1925
Ty Cobb is 6 for 6, including 3 HRs, in Detroit's 14-8 win over the
Browns. All three homers are off different pitchers. Cobb's 16 total bases
tops Joe Hauser's 14 of August 2, 1924 and sets a new AL record.

Everett Scott is benched by New York manager Miller Huggins, ending his
record 1,307-game playing streak. Pee Wee Wanninger replaces him at SS in
the 6-2 loss to the A's. Scott will soon go to Washington on waivers. The
Yanks send lefty P Ray Francis to the Red Sox for OF Bobby Veach and P Alex
Ferguson. The 2 will be waived together in August.

1926
Detroit batters 5 White Sox pitchers enroute to a 14-7 score over Chicago. Red
Wingo puts the icing on the cake with a 9th inning grand slam.

1927
The Senators even the series at 2 apiece with the Yankees as Hod Lisenbee
wins, 6-1. The Yanks manage 6 hits - 3 by Meusel. The Nats are playing their
4th game without stars Rice and Goslin. Rice is out with sinus trouble and
Goose has pleurisy.

1929
In the first Sunday home game the Braves ever play, Milt Gaston, with his
brother Alex behind the plate, relieves Red Ruffing in the 7th inning to
become the second pair of siblings to be battery mates in American League
history. Tommy and Homer Thompson, who appeared in one game together for
the Yankees in 1912, were the first. The Braves lose to Pittsburgh, 7-2,
before 35,000. The winning pitcher is Burleigh Grimes, who helps his own
cause by starting a 3rd inning triple play (1-5-2-5-4-2) on a grounder
by Spohrer. Mueller is run down, Spohrer is caught trying to reach 2B and
Maranville is caught trying to score. The Bucs have 4 triples, one each by
the Waners.

1930
The Red Sox trade Red Ruffing to the Yankees for Cedric Durst. The deal
enables Boston to sell Tom Zachary to the Braves for the waiver price.

Making his first start, Lefty Gomez (1-1) goes all the way to beat the White
Sox, 4-1, on a 5-hitter. Red Faber takes the loss for Chicago. Lefty's one
other appearance, in relief, resulted in a loss on April 29th.

Reds SS Hod Ford smashes 4 extra base hits - 3 doubles and a triple - in his
first 4 at-bats to lead Cincinnati to a 10-6 win over the Braves. Burleigh
Grimes is the loser.

The Athletics say it with homers beating the Browns 4-3 in 12 innings and
scoring all their runs on solo four baggers. Al Simmons' leadoff homer in
the bottom of the 12th makes Lefty Grove a winner over General Crowder,
as both starters go all the way. Boley with 2 and Haas with one provide the
other A's scores, a record to date in the AL. The Giants will score 5 runs
on solo HRs 5 weeks from now.

1931
At Philadelphia, George Earnshaw strikes out 10 as he pitches the A's to
a 4-1 win over the Red Sox. The A's (9-9) tied for 4th, will reel off a
17-game win streak to vault into first place.

1932
Sacramento pitcher Tony Frietas pitches the first night no-hitter in PCL
history, beating Oakland, 2-0.

Jimmie Foxx has a homer, 2 singles and scores 5 times as the A's beat
Cleveland and Wes Ferrell, 15-3. Lefty Grove holds Cleveland scoreless till
the 7th when Willie Kamm hits a 2-run HR. The Mackmen retaliate with 7 runs
in the frame.

1933
Pepper Martin of the Cardinals hits for the cycle and adds a double in a
5-3 win against the Phillies.

1934
With the Red Sox leading 9-3 against the Browns, Lefty Grove makes his first
appearance in a Boston uniform, and bombs. He gives up 3 hits and 2 walks,
5 earned runs, without retiring a batter.

1935
Thirty thousand fans are on hand in Boston to watch two superstars face
each other - the Cardinals with young Dizzy Dean on the mound against the
Braves with 40-year-old Babe Ruth. Diz walks Ruth his first 2 times up,
then with 2 strikes on the Bambino, Dean, with a big grin on his face,
waves his outfielders back and pipes a fast ball down the middle that
Ruth misses. Dean wins the game, 7-0, and in his first at-bat, homers over
Ruth's head in right. Dean will face Ruth again on the 19th, holding the
Babe hitless again, and win that game as well.

1936
The Braves Danny MacFayden bests Paul Dean, 1-0, to knock the Cards out of
1st place. MacFayden allows 3 hits.

1938
Hal Kelleher of the Phillies faces 16 batters in the 8th inning, as the
Cubs score 12 runs. Both marks are NL records off one hurler in a single
inning. The Cubs win 21-2 with Joe Marty tallying 4 runs, 4 RBIs and 4 hits,
and Augie Galan adding a homer and triple and another 4 ribbies. The loss
goes to Wayne LeMaster who throws just 3 pitches to leadoff batter Stan Hack
before leaving the game with a pain in his throwing arm. Tommy Reis relieves
and allows 4 runs to score, but the first is charged to LeMaster. Al Epperly
wins the laugher.

1939
In a 10-5 A's win, the A's Sam Chapman hits for the cycle against the
Browns Harry Kimberlin. Tomorrow he'll homer in his first two at-bats
against Johnny Marcum.

1940
The visiting Dodgers use 22 players and the Cards use 17 for a ML record
39 players in a nine-inning game. The Dodgers score four runs in the 9th
to win, 9-6.

1941
Bobo Newsom and the Tigers trounce the Yankees, 10-1, in Detroit. Joe
DiMaggio is held hitless and has gone 7 for 43 in his last 12 games.

1943
In the nitecap 5-2 win against the Indians, Chicago's Wally Moses steals
home. It is Wally's second steal of home in extra innings, tying Tony
Lazzeri's mark. Cleveland wins the opener, 2-1.

7th inning for a 13-1 victory over the Phillies in the opener. Chicago
drops the nitecap, 7-1.

The Giants and Reds split a pair with New York taking the opener, 3-2. In the
7-4 Reds win, Cincinnati fans boo the substitution of Ray Mueller for C Ray
Lamanno, who had 3 hits in 4 trips to the plate. Sent in for the final inning
to preserve a NL record consecutive-game catching streak of 233 contests,
Mueller sits out the next day. Mueller missed only 81 innings during the
streak, which began July 31, 1943 and included Army service through 1945.

In a Bucs' doubleheader sweep at Pittsburgh, the Dodgers attract an overflow
crowd that spills onto the field and is held back by ropes. There are 9
"crowd doubles" as the Pirates win, 5-4, in 11 innings and 4-3. The double
loss drops the Bums out of a first place tie with the Cards. In game 2,
Preacher Roe relieves Nick Strincevich with 2 outs in the top of sixth
with the score tied 3-3. With a 6 p.m. curfew looming, pinch runner Bob
Ramazzotti tries to steal home on Roe's 1st pitch and is tagged out by C
Bill Salkeld. In the bottom of the 6th, Frankie Gustine drives in the winning
run with a crowd double, and the game is called, giving Roe a one-pitch win.

1948
Against the Tigers, Red Sox P Mel Parnell has 2 balks called on successive
pitches. He scatters 10 hits and gets no decision as reliever Ellis Kinder is
the 4-3 winner. SS Vern Stephens participates in 5 DPs with Boston getting
another going Williams to Tebbetts.

1949
Charlie Gehringer, star 2B of the Tigers between 1925-41, is picked for
the Hall of Fame. Two days later, the Old-Timers committee will select Kid
Nichols and Three-Finger Brown.

At the Polo Grounds, Johnny Mize pounds a 10th-inning homer and the Giants
beat the Pirates, 3-2, to sweep their three-game series. The homer, off
Murry Dickson, is Big John's 300th. Reliever Hank Behrman, in for Sheldon
Jones, pitches out of tight jams in the 9th and 10th to win. Wally Westlake
is stranded in the 10th after reaching Behrman for a leadoff triple.

Before the start of a series with the Yanks, the White Sox abandon
their trick LF fence. The 5-foot chicken wire fence, erected to cut the
distance by 20 feet, resulted in 11 HRs in 8 games, but opponents hit 7
of them. The AL will subsequently rule that fences cannot be moved more
than once a season. The Yanks still win today, 7-5, to go to 13-3. Tommy
Henrich has the only homer, while Johnny Lindell, Yankee left fielder,
twice makes catches that would've cleared the wire fence. Allie Reynolds,
with help from Joe Page, is the winner.

At Cleveland, Bob Feller, making his first start since pitching two innings
in the season opener and coming up with a sore shoulder, beats the Red
Sox, 7-3. The Tribe scores six in the 2nd inning, including Ken Keltner's
three-run homer off Jack Kramer. On the next pitch, Minnie Minoso, making
his second start, hits his first major-league homer. Ted Williams and Bobby
Doerr hit 8th-inning homers for Boston, while Joe Gordon adds a homer in
the 5th for Cleveland.

in 6 1/3 innings for the win.

grandfather died eight years earlier of the same disease.

1953
In the second game of a twin bill at Milwaukee's County Stadium, Braves'
hurler Max Surkont strikes out the hitter for the third out of the second
inning, and will continue to fan batters until there is one out in the
fifth inning enroute to a 10-3 victory over the Reds. The eight consecutive
strikeouts establishes a new major league record surpassing the mark of
seven straight strikeouts shared by Dazzy Vance (Robins aka Dodgers, 1924)
and Van Mungo (Dodgers, 1936).

Pitcher Bob Porterfield of the Senators hits his first ML homer, a 4th
inning grand slam off Bill Wight of Detroit, and the Nats add six more in

to roll to an 11-1 win over Bob Lemon. Winner Whitey Ford scores two runs
and is lifted in the 8th after Wally Westlake spoils his shutout with a
homer. The loss drops the Indians a half game behind the leading Yanks.

1-0. Bob Porterfield, who tossed 9 shutouts last year, beats Bob Keegan.

Walks do in the Browns Bob Turley, who gives up 2 hits in losing to the
Yankees, 4-2. It's Turley's 2nd 2-hit loss of the season - the Indians beat
him on April 21.

1955
The musical "Damn Yankees" based on Douglass Wallop's novel "The Year the
Yankees Lost the Pennant" opens on Broadway. The comedy, set in Washington,
D.C during the Bronx Bombers' dominance in baseball in the 1950s, tells the
tale of an aging Washington Senators fan bargaining with the devil to help
his hapless team.

In his first ML start, Dodger southpaw Tom Lasorda throws 3 wild pitches
in the first inning, to tie a record. He also receives a spike wound from
Wally Moon of the Cardinals in a play at the plate. Lasorda later blames
his wildness on his catcher, Roy Campanella, but the Dodgers go on to
win the game, 4-3. The future Dodgers' Hall of Fame skipper, who will
compile a lifetime record of 0-4, will not get a decision in his debut.
Before today's game, Don Newcombe refuses to pitch batting practice for
the 2nd time this week and Walt Alston tells him he's suspended. The two

to end the game. The Giants send up a (since tied) record 6 pinch hitters
in the inning, and 3 score, tying the ML mark.

1962
In just his fourth big league start, Angels rookie Bo Belinsky pitches
the first no-hitter in Angels history, and the first one ever tossed at
Dodger Stadium, against the Orioles, the organization from which the cocky
25-year-old lefty was drafted last year. Belinsky has 9 strikeouts and
beats Steve Barber 2-0. Bo is only the tenth major league rookie to ever
throw a no-hitter.

an emboldened Phillips tries to steal home and is out. When the Astros
score in the bottom of the 13th, Carpin is the victor without facing a batter.

Reds edge the Dodgers, 3-2.

1969
The Baseball Records Committee reverses its earlier decision and decides
to stay with the pre-1920 rules on sudden death homeruns. This rule stated
that a team batting last in the 9th or in extra innings could not win by
more than one run. Before 1920 if a player hit an outside-the-park homerun

verbatim to those she expressed in 1992, which resulted in a league fine
and a year's suspension.

1999
Beating the Cubs, 13-6, the Rockies become only the third team in the 1900's
