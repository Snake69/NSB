home, and Hal Chase has 2 steals.

1908

to drive in 6 runs.

winning his first 2 decisions in 1906 by shutouts.

1912
The Cards top the Giants, 5-1, stopping the Giants win streak at 14
straight. The Giants fast start of 43-11 is the best this century (tied by
Yankees of 1939).

1913
Accusing Hal Chase of playing below his capability, Yankees manager Frank
Chance sends him to the White Sox for light-hitting infielder Rollie Zeider
and 1B Babe Borton. Borton hit .371 last year. Despite his uncertain character
and questionable honesty, Chase will be on the scene another 6 years. Zeider,
who set the AL rookie record for stolen bases in 1910 with 49, is suffering
from foot problems. When Borton hits .133 in 39 games, writer Mark Roth
remarks, "Hal Chase was traded to the White Sox for an onion and a bunion."

New York beats the Phils, 3-2, to sweep the four-game series with the NL
leaders. With the win John McGraw joins Fred Clarke, Cap Anson, Frank Selee
and Connie Mack as managers who have won 1,000 games.

In the first of two, Brooklyn's Eddie "Smoke" Stack beats the Braves for
the 3rd time this season, shutting them out, 2-0. The two teams play to a
10-inning 3-3 tie in game 2.

1914
Joe Benz ("Blitzen"), who will be the AL's leading loser with 19, no-hits
Cleveland 6-1 at Comiskey Park. Three straight errors in the 4th inning
give the Naps their only run. The loser is Abe Bowman, who "is withdrawn
in favor of Blanding after three spasms (Chicago Tribune)." Cap Weaver
and Ray Demmitt each have three hits to pace the 7th place White Sox.
The game takes 1-hour 45-minutes.

1915
The Pirates score just one run in each game of a doubleheader, but it's
enough for an a.m.-p.m. sweep of the first-place Cubs. Wilbur Cooper and
Al Mamaux both toss 1-0 whitewashes. Jimmy Lavender loses the opener when
he walks 3 in the 3rd and hits the 4th batter to force in a run. In the
afternoon contest Larry Cheney allows 2 hits - both by Max Carey - but
loses when Hinchman walks, goes to 2nd on an out and scores on a wild pitch.

Reb Russell is 1-1 on the day for the White Sox. He is knocked out in the
a.m. game, a 4-3 loss to Detroit, but he comes back to win the afternoon
game, 3-1. The combined attendence is 32,000.

Chinese University of Hawaii loses, 5-4, to Columbia in an errorless game.

Duncan of Union College strikes out 18 against CCNY to tie the college mark

4-2, behind Jimmy Ring.

At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees outslug Washington, winning 7-6 in the
morning game and 10-7 in the afternoon match. New York wins the opener
with three runs in the 9th to pin the loss on reliever Al Schacht. George
Mogridge is the winner. New York scores 5 in the 6th when Duff Lewis and
Truck Hannah hit back-to-back homers, and the Yanks get a single and two
triples to knock out Shaw. In the afternoon game before 38,000 fans, Walter
Johnson pitches 4 2/3 innings of ineffective relief for the Nats and gives
up a tremendous HR to Ruth in the 8th that hits the facade on the upper deck
in right field. A bright spot for Washington is Braggo Roth, who swipes four
bases, including 2B and 3B in the 4th inning,, then swiping home on the front
end of a double steal. Braggo will swipe another 4 on June 12. Peckinpaugh
has four hits in game 2, including a pair of doubles and a triple.

The Dodgers capture both ends of the holiday twinbill against the Giants,
and climb into a first-place tie with the Cubs. Burleigh Grimes wins the

draws two walks in the 9th inning to tie a ML record.

1927
An unassisted triple play is made for the second consecutive day in the major
leagues. During the ninth inning of the Navin Field contest, first baseman
John Neun saves the Tigers' 1-0 victory when he completes the rare play by
catching a Homer Summa line drive, tagging Charlie Jamieson who was on first,
and beating Glenn Myatt to second base making it the first time the last three
outs of a game results from a solo triple killing. Rip Collins gets the win.

The Yankees slug the 3rd-place Athletics into submission, winning 10-3 and
18-5. Ruth homers in each game to run his string to 4 straight games. He
finishes the month with 12 homers, and 16 altogether. Rookie strongboy

unassisted double play by Chicago CF Adam Comorosky, Bob Smith shuts out
the Bucs, 5-0. Heine Meine is the loser.

At St. Louis, the Cards take the first game from the Reds, 7-5, then
drop the nitecap, 7-2, ending a streak of 25 straight home victories over
Cincinnati. The streak, which started in the 2nd game on April 27, 1929,
is an NL record.

1932
Tony Freitas, the pint-sized portsider, makes his major league debut for
the A's against Washington. He gives up a tying homer to Joe Cronin in the
9th but pitches impressively until leaving in the 11th. George Earnshaw
comes on and allows a run in the 12th to lose, 5-4.

sees the Dodgers end Carl Hubbell's consecutive-game winning streak at 24
over 2 seasons. Babe Phelps leads the way, going 5 for 6, as Brooklyn routs
King Carl in the 4th inning and wins 10-3. Although Hubbell loses the first
game of the doubleheader, he is honored in between games when Babe Ruth makes
the presentation of the NL's 1936 MVP Award. The Giants take the nitecap, 5-4.

In front of a crowd of 14,352 at Cincinnati, the Reds whip the Pirates,
8-3, in the opener before losing 5-4 in the second game. Peaches Davis
is the winner with 5+ innings while Gee Walker has 2 triples and scores
3. For the Reds it is their lone victory this year against Pittsburgh.

to one team, 17 of the losses this year to the Pirates.

1942
Against the Pirates, the Reds' Clyde Vollmer chops a homerun on the first
ML pitch he sees, the 5th major leaguer to do so. Pitcher Max Butcher is
the instant loser as the Reds go on to win, 3-0, in this 2nd game of a
doubleheader. The Reds win game 1, 8-2. Vollmer's next homer won't come
until 1947.

In game 1 of a twinbill sweep at Brooklyn, Dixie Walker of the Dodgers is
credited with an inside-the-park grand slam as the Braves' aging Paul Waner
searches for the ball under the bullpen bench. Walker follows Pee Wee Reese,
Pete Reiser and Arky Vaughan over the plate. The Dodgers win, 10-2. Brooklyn
wins the nitecap, 3-1, behind Whit Wyatt's 10th straight win over Boston.

Before 22,000 at Griffith Stadium, Satchel Paige pitches 5 innings to defeat
the Dizzy Dean All-Stars, 8-1. Dean pitches just the first inning, giving up
3 hits and 2 runs. Private Cecil Travis plays 3B. The game a week earlier, in
which Paige won 3-1 at Wrigley Field, drew 29,000. Judge Landis will prohibit
a scheduled July 4th matchup because the first 2 games outdrew ML games.

1943
Mort Cooper gives up a 7th inning hit to Billy Jurges in stopping the
Dodgers on a one-hitter, 7-0. Jurges' fly ball loops down the foul line.

perfect game, the first in league history.

to Elmer Riddle. Andy Pafko is the hitting star, pounding out five hits,
including a homer in each game.

4-3 and 7-0. In the nitecap, Ken Raffensberger tosses a one-hitter, allowing
just an 8th inning single by Nipsy Jones. Hank Sauer's homer in the opener
breaks a tie. The Reds' scoring in the nitecap is paced by homers from Augie
Galan and Ted Kluszewski. The twin loss drops the Cards to second place as
the Giants split a pair with the Dodgers.

The Senators, fresh from four wins over the Red Sox, drop a pair to the
host Yankees before 62,626. Spec Shea allows just two hits in coasting
in the opener, 10-0. The Yanks collect 16 hits, including homers by Tommy
Henrich and George McQuinn. The Yanks take the nitecap, 5-4, as Red Embree
makes a rare start. Bobby Brown makes 7 straight hits in the two games,
making outs his first and last at-bats.

The Indians drub the Browns, 8-3, then lose 6-0, to stay in 2nd place behind
the A's. In the opener, Lou Boudreau hits a grand slam and Jim Hegan homers
in the 5-run 6th inning. Gene Bearden is the winner. In the nitecap, Cliff
Fannin allows just 4 hits to win.

Grove. The Sox take the nitecap, 9-3, with veteran Ike Pearson picking up the
win. Ike will finish the year at 2-3 to close out hs career at 13-50. His .206
winning percentage is the worst in ML history for a pitcher with 50 losses.

Cleveland druggist Charley Lupica boldly climbs to a 20-foot platform atop
a flagpole after announcing that he was staying there until the Indians

will be rewarded for his loyalty with a new car by Bill Veeck.

1950
Washington sends 1B Eddie Robinson, P Ray Scarborough and Al Kozar to the
White Sox for P Bob Kuzava, 2B Cass Michaels and OF John Ostrowski. Robinson
will set a club record in 1951, since-broken, with 29 HR.

With their record 8-25 and in last place, the Browns fire Dr. David
Tracy. Tracy, a New York psychologist, had been hired to help the players

1952
Charlie Grimm succeeds Tommy Holmes as manager of the Boston Braves. Holmes
will sign on with the Dodgers as a pinch hitter, but hit just .111.

1954
The Dodgers send Joe Black, their 1952 relief ace and Rookie of the Year,
to their Montreal farm club. His ERA is 11.57 in 5 appearances.

20-10. Piersall and Bolling each collect 4. Bill Henry completes the sweep
with a 9-0 shutout in game 2. Harry Agganis drives in 4 runs with a HR and 2B.

1956
The Cubs and Braves keep banging on each other like rented mules, with

August 29, 1951.

1958

hit 23 HRs this season, but no more in the pinch. The Phils win the opener,
6-0, behind Robin Roberts.

homer. Mantle almost homers, but his 438-foot drive is caught by CF Bob
Allison.

1961
Mantle and Maris again homer as New York edges Boston, 7-6. Mantle's is #14,
two ahead of Roger. In the 8th inning, Carroll Hardy pinch hits for rookie
Carl Yastrzemski. On September 20, 1960 he pinch hit for Ted Williams,

Veteran pitcher Early Wynn signs with the Indians.

1964
At New York, the Mets and Giants square off in a Memorial Day doubleheader
that starts at 1 p.m. and doesn't conclude until 11:25 p.m. After Juan
Marichal's 5-3, first-game win, San Francisco holds a 6-1 lead in the
2nd until New York rallies for 5 to tie in the 7th. The big blow is
Joe Christopher's 3-run homer that bounces off Mays' glove over the
fence. Eventually, with 2 out in the 23rd, pinch hitter Del Crandall
delivers a run-scoring double off Galen Cisco, and the Giants prevail
8-6 after 7-hours 22-minutes - a record. Crandall ended the first post
midnight game ever played in the NL, while catching for the Boston Braves
in 1949. Gaylord Perry pitches 10 scoreless innings to get credit for the
win. Perry is reported to have thrown his first spitball in a major league
game. Thirty-two innings and an elapsed time of 9-hours 50-minutes are
doubleheader records, as are 47 strikeouts. New York's 22 K's in the 2nd
game are the most by one club in an overtime contest.

1965
For the first time in history, an all-switch-hitting infield starts a big
league game. In the nightcap of a twin bill, the Dodgers, with Wes Parker
at first base, Jim Lefebvre at second, Maury Wills at shortstop and Jim

pitch with the bases loaded and no outs in the 9th inning, but umpire Harry
Wendelstedt rules Dietz did not try to avoid the pitch. Coach Herman Franks
argues the call so long he is tossed by Wendelstedt. Dietz then pops out,
and the next two batters make outs. Los Angeles wins, 3-0, and Drysdale's
5th straight shutout ties the ML record set in 1904 by Doc White.

St. Louis P Larry Jaster retires the first 23 Mets before Greg Goosen
singles. The lefty settles for a 2-hitter, beating Tom Seaver, 2-0.

3rd inning grand slam.

1973
Against Houston, Cubs pitcher Fergie Jenkins gives up a HR to Jesus Alou,
but holds on as the Cubs win, 16-8. Dave Roberts takes the loss. The tally
of Alou family homers off Jenkins is as follows:  Jesus homered on July 7th

The Royals beat the Brewers 7-5 in a game bridging the generation gap. Home
run leaders Henry Aaron and Harmon Killebrew are in their 22nd ML seasons

in the majors before Brewers SS Robin Yount was born.

Don Gullett allows 4 hits as the Reds beat the Cards, 6-0.

1976

the Cardinals. For Carlton, it is his 10th win in a row over the Birds
going back to May of 1979.

1982
The Phils outbrawl the Reds to win, 5-4, in 13 innings. Mario Soto holds the
Phils to one hit, while hitting two himself - Bob Dernier and Mike Schmidt
- on successive pitches in the 6th. In the 7th, Ron Reed plunks Soto, who
starts for the mound with his bat. He is restrained, but Dave Concepcion
steps in landing punches to Reed. All three are tossed and Reds reliever

or be in his Yankee Stadium office during the suspension.

1984
Mario Soto is suspended for 5 days by NL president Chub Feeney for his role in
a 32-minute melee that marred the Reds-Cubs game on May 27th. After shoving
3B umpire Steve Ripley, who had signaled that Ron Cey's long fly ball was
a 3-run homerun (it was later ruled foul), a bat-wielding Soto then tried
