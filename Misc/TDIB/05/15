May 15

1901
The first shut out in American League history is recorded when the Washington
Senators blank the Boston Americans, 4-0. Watty Lee is the winner on
a 3-hitter.

Mathewson (6-0) tosses his 3rd straight shutout outpitching Jack Taylor to
beat the Colts, 4-0. The Giants move into 1st place with the win over Chicago.

1903
At Detroit, the Tigers pick on Boston American outfielder Pat Dougherty
and collect 5 triples and two homers in winning, 8-6. Dougherty misjudges
a number of fly balls.

1905
Joe McGinnity and the Giants edge the Chicago Colts (Cubs), 4-0. Three
Finger Brown is the loser.

1906
Hooks Wiltse of the Giants becomes the 2nd pitcher of the modern era to
fan 4 batters in a single inning [he is credited as the first; however,
Doc White fanned 4 batters on July 21, 1902], fanning the side after the
first Cincinnati batter, Jim Delahanty, in the 5th inning reaches base on
Roger Bresnahan's 3rd-strike error. Wiltse also fanned the side in the 4th
inning to total 7 batters punched out in just two innings, the first and
only time this happens in ML history. Hooks K's 12 Reds overall enroute to
a victory, 4-1. However, the Giants suffer a major loss when Turkey Mike
Donlin, after getting 3 hits, breaks his leg sliding into 2B.

1911
With the score tied in the 10th inning, Boston's Smoky Joe Wood intentionally
walks Ty Cobb, issuing one of two intentional free passes the star will
receive all season. Two batters later Jim Delahanty drives in Cobb for
Detroit's 5-4 win. With two safeties today, Cobb starts a 40-game hit streak.

In Philadelphia, the Phils tally 43 total bases and paste the Reds, 21-5.

Ring Lardner writes, "They are using a new ball this year. It's livelier and
that means more hitting, and more hitting means longer games, and that's the
devil. It appears to be impossible to finish a game in less than two hours."

The Giants beat the Cardinals 10-6 in a game that takes 2 hours 20 minutes to
play. The New York Times headlines "Giants Win Long, Uninteresting Game". The
Times writer seems to think the new cork-centered ball is partly at fault
(according to R.J. Lesch).

1912
At Hilltop Park, Ty Cobb, after listening to days of heckling by Yankee
fans, jumps into the stands near the Tigers dugout and pummels a handicapped
fan. The man, identified pseudonymously as Otto Blotz (real name, Claude
Lueker), cannot defend himself against the "Georgia Peach" as he only
has one hand. Other fans and Tigers mix it up before order is restored,
and Ban Johnson suspends Cobb indefinitely for the incident. The Tigers
win the contest, 8-4.

1913
At Boston, outfielder Beals Becker has 5 hits and scores 5 runs to lead
the Reds to an 11-5 win. Becker is subbing for the injured Bob Bescher.

Joe Evers, brother of Johnny Evers, is released by the Giants. Evers had
been with the squad since its departure for Texas in February (as noted by
Norman Macht).

1914
At Forbes Field, Mathewson outpitches George McQuillan to give the Giants
a 5-3 win over the Pirates.

1915
Claude Hendrix pitches a 10-0 no-hitter for Chicago (FL) over Pittsburgh.

1916
The Nationals top the A's, 6-5, in 11 innings. Reliever Walter Johnson fans
6 of the 14 batters he faces.

1917
In Cleveland, P Babe Ruth is lifted with one out in the 6th and the Red
Sox leading 6-5. Dutch Leonard then shuts down the Indians to preserve the
victory, and he is awarded the win by the official scorer. The decision is
eventually reversed, giving Ruth his 8th straight win. The White Sox will
stop his streak on the 18th.

1918
Former player-manager Patsy Tebeau commits suicide in St. Louis.

In a game that features no substitutions and no errors, White Sox pitcher
Lefty Williams and the Senators' Walter Johnson hook up for an 18-inning
shutout marathon. The Nats finally push across a run in the 18th when Williams
gives up two singles and then, with runners on the corners, heaves a wild
pitch. Johnson scatters 10 hits in the win while Lefty allows 8. Johnson's
gem is the longest shutout ever, but will be tied by Hubbell in 1933.

1919
After a scoreless twelve-inning duel at Ebbets Field between Hod Eller and Al
Mamaux, the Reds bomb Mamaux for 10 runs in the 13th, six after two are out,
to beat first-place Brooklyn, 10-0. A walk, infield error and infield single
load the bases for Edd Roush, who triples. A strikeout and sac fly follow to
clean the sacks. Mamaux then issues his 10th walk and Ivy Wingo follows with
a triple. The scoring ends when Roush drives in his 4th run of the inning,
and Daubert flies out for the 3rd out. Reds RF Alfred "Greasy" Neale has a
record 10 putouts as the Reds outfield trio makes 22 putouts. Winning P Hod
Eller, who tossed a no-hitter in his last outing, will have his scoreless
string end at 22 innings, but he will go on to win 10 in a row.

Ump George Moriarty ejects Boston P Joe Bush in the top of the 2nd inning,
and reliever Babe Ruth pitches 11 innings allowing 13 hits, to beat the
White Sox, 6-5.

1920
At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees beat Cleveland, handing Stan Coveleski (7-1)
his first loss of the year. Pitcher Jack Quinn hits a homer off Coveleski
with a man on in the 8th to win, 2-0. Quinn allows just 4 hits with only
one runner getting past 1B. Ruth is 0 for 1, though the official scorecard
has him at 0 for 2, a discrepancy that will not be corrected till 2005.

1921
Walter Johnson starts for Washington but Detroit batters light him up. Harry
Heilmann drives in 2 runs on a single and Johnson departs. Detroit wins
the slugfest, 13-10, though Walter is not the loser.

1922
In a 4-1 win at New York, Ty Cobb beats out a grounder to SS Everett
Scott. Veteran writer Fred Lieb scores it a hit in the boxscore he files
with the Associated Press. But official scorer John Kieran of the New
York Tribune gives an error to Scott. At the season's end, the AL official
records, based on AP boxscores, list Cobb at .401. New York writers complain
unsuccessfully, claiming it should be .399, based on the official scorer's
stats. Lieb will reverse himself at the end of the year, but Ban Johnson
goes with the hit call.

1923
At Boston, the Cards trim the Braves 10-5. The Birds are led by Jim
Bottomley's three triples.

1926
Behind Pete Donohue, the Reds whip the Giants, 11-6, and move into first
place. Led by the NL's 2 top hitters - C Bubbles Hargrave at .353 and OF
Cuckoo Christensen at .350 - and the pitching of Pete Donohue, Carl Mays
and Eppa Rixey, they'll stay in 1st until mid-July.

1927
In St. Louis, Bing Miller has his 2nd 4-hit day in a row, and Wally Schang
is 3 for 3 with a grand slam to lead the Browns to an 8-6 win over the
A's. Collins and Simmons homer for Philley.

1928
The Giants make 6 double plays against the Cubs at Wrigley, but lose 10-7.

1932
In a 9-2 win at Boston, White Sox 3B Carey Selph strikes out for the 9th
time this season. It won't happen again. Selph will go another 89 games,
a ML-record, without a K, hitting .283 (396 AB) in his 2nd and last season.

1933
The major leagues advance the cut-down date a month, limiting rosters to
23 players on May 15 instead of June 15.

The Red Sox pick up ex-Yankee Dusty Cooke from Newark (IL) for OF Johnny
Watwood and 2B Marv Olson.

1934
Buffalo (IL) hits a record 5 HRs in one inning against Albany, 4 of them
in a row, to win 8-2. After the 5th HR, rookie Jake Plummer is beaned by
the Albany pitcher, Jones, and a promising career is ruined.

In St. Louis, the Stengel-led Dodgers steal a win in the 8th to top the
Cardinals, 6-5. Lonnie Frey, on the front end of a successful double steal,
scores the tie-breaking run. Jack Rothrock is 5 for 5 with a HR for the
Birds. Rothrock has only made one out in the last 2 games.

The Cubs pick up pitcher Jim Weaver (2-0), waived by the Browns to Newark
as St. Louis cut their roster down to 23 men. He'll win 11 games for Chicago
this year.

Thomas Turner, owner of Portland (PCL), announces that he is disgusted with
his team's play and has traded outfielder, Hawaiian-born Henry "Prince"
Oana, to Atlanta and put his entire team on waivers. The Prince had a cup
of coffee this year as an outfielder with the Phillies and will resurface
in 1943 as a pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, going 3-2.

1935
Lou Gehrig steals home in a 4-0 Yankee win over the Tigers. It is his 15th
and last steal of home, all of which were double steals.

The Pirates swamp the Phillies, 20-5, as Lloyd Waner scores 5 runs.

The Giants make Dolf Luque a coach, the Browns buy Russ Van Atta from the
Yankees, and the Dodgers obtain George Earnshaw on waivers from the White Sox.

1936
Washington's Bobo Newsom strikes out 11 former teammates to hand the Browns
their 23rd loss in their last 27 games. The Nats win, 10-5, behind a 17-hit
attack. Les Tietja is the loser without retiring a batter.

1937
Walter Johnson Jr makes his professional debut pitching for Des Moines.

1940
1B Art Mahan and 2B Herman Schulte establish themselves as regulars at
their positions with the Phillies. Fewer than a dozen players have been
120-or-more-game regulars in their only season in the ML, and the Phillies,
again locked in last place, have 2 of them in one season. Neither Phillie
will hit .250, but Schulte will top 2B in fielding.

In the Pirates 5-2 loss to the Giants, only 3 Bucs bat in the 2nd, but all
reach base. Maurice Van Roblys singles and is picked off, Vince DiMaggio
walks and is forced at 2B by Frankie Gustine, who is caught stealing.

1941
Joe DiMaggio begins his 56-game hitting streak getting a single in four
at-bats against White Sox pitcher Edgar Smith. The Yankee outfielder will
collect at least one hit in every game until July 17 when his unrivaled
accomplishment, which captures the attention of a nation, is stopped in
Cleveland with the help of outstanding defensive plays by third baseman
Ken Keltner. Today the Yankees lose, 13-1. Taffy Wright homers and drives
in 4 White Sox runs, the 8th straight game he's driven in a run.

A single by Jimmie Bloodworth in the 7th is the only hit for the Senators
as they lose to the Browns' Denny Galehouse, 7-0.

Rip Radcliff, one of the top AL batters in 1940 for the Browns, is waived
to the Tigers as a result of a sudden batting decline.

The Browns trade P Vern Kennedy to the Senators for vet Rick Ferrell. The
Senators release vet P Danny MacFayden.

1944
A day after the Reds pitch a one-hitter, Reds reliever Clyde Shoun, making
his first start of the season, throws a no-hitter to nip the Boston Braves
1-0. Only 1,014 see the 32-year-old lefty top Jim Tobin, who had thrown
one in April. Reds reserve 3B Chuck Aleno accounts for the sole run with
his only 1944 HR.

Frankie Hayes hits a grand slam in the 9th inning off the Tigers Rufe Gentry,
as the Athletics win 6-2.

1946
Fireworks occur as Brooklyn starter Les Webber brushes back Slaughter in
the first inning, but the Cardinal outfielder retaliates by bunting up
the 1B line and flattening Webber as he tries to field the bunt. Slaught
then silences the fans with two catches in the first inning and a throw to
double off Furillo. The Cards move into first place by edging the Dodgers,
1-0, behind Howie Pollet.

Mel Harder and Steve Gromek fire back to back shutouts over the A's as
Cleveland wins two, 3-0 and 5-0.

1947
Behind Ralph Kiner's two homeruns, the Pirates beat the Dodgers, 7-3, handing
Brooklyn its 8th loss in 9 games. Billy Cox also homers for the Pirates.

1948
At Brooklyn, Russell's first inning HR is the only score as Boston's Warren
Spahn beats Rex Barney, 1-0. It's the 3rd shutout in a row for Brave hurlers.

The Pirates score 2 runs in the 6th inning to snap Harry Brecheen's
consecutive scoreless innings pitched at 32 2/3 from the start of the
year. The lefty still wins his 4th without a loss, 8-3.

In a PCL game, Seattle's Dick Barrett stops Sacramento, 2-0 with a 7-inning
perfect game.

1949
White Sox hurler Bill Wight coasts to a 10-0 win over the Indians, and Al
Gettel follows with a 2-0 whitewash of the Tribe.

Boston's Vern Bickford stops the Dodgers, 4-0, allowing just four singles. One
is by Gil Hodges extending his hitting streak to 17 games. Jim Russell switch
hits a homer and double to pin the loss on Morrie Martin. The Braves start Al
Lakeman at 1B in place of Earl Torgeson, who separated his shoulder yesterday
when he attempted to block Jackie Robinson on a double play. Torgeson will
be operated on tomorrow and will be sidelined several months.

1950
The Yankees sell veteran OF Johnny Lindell to the Cardinals and P Clarence
"Cuddles" Marshall to the Browns.

1951
At Fenway Park, the Red Sox celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first AL
game in Boston. On hand are 29 old-timers who played, managed, or umpired
in the AL in that first year including Connie Mack, Dummy Hoy, Cy Young,
Hugh Duffy, Clark Griffith, Tom Connolly, Billy Sullivan Sr, Wid Conroy,
Bill Bradley and Ollie Pickering. Eight of the 29 participated in the first
AL game, played in Chicago on April 24, 1901. The game that followed the
ceremony featured dramatic homeruns as Ted Williams hits the 300th of his
career in the 4th inning against Chicago's Howie Judson. With Williams up
in the 8th inning, White Sox manager Paul Richards moves reliever Harry
Dorish to 3B and brings in Billy Pierce to pitch to Ted. Williams pops
up against the lefty, and Dorish then returns to the mound. Boston ties
the game against Dorish at 7-7, but little Nellie Fox, playing in his 6th
season, cracks his first major league homer in the 11th to give Dorish a 9-7
victory. Ray Scarborough is the loser. The Sox will win their next 13 games.

At Crosley Field, Braves P Vern Bickford pitches a 2-hitter, but Ewell
Blackwell bests him by allowing one hit, as the Reds win, 1-0. Connie
Ryan's 6th inning hit is the 1st off Bickford, and Johnny Pramesa's homer
in the 7th is the other. The only Boston hit is a 5th inning double by Bob
Elliott. The Reds tie the NL record (set in 1911) for 9 innings by going
to bat just 24 times.

In a fine trade for Chicago, the White Sox send lefty Bob Cain to the Tigers
for hurler Saul Rogovin.

1952
Virgil Trucks throws the first of his two-hitters this season blanking
the Senators, 1-0. In August, the Tigers' right-hander will also keep the
Yankees hitless in another 1-0 game that becomes controversial when Phil
Rizzuto's third inning at-bat is first ruled an error then a hit, only to
be changed back into an error three frames later.

After pitching four no-hitters in the minors, 33-year-old Virgil "Fire"
Trucks of Detroit pitches his first in the ML, a 1-0 blanking of the
Senators. Vic Wertz' dramatic two-out HR in the 9th off Bob Porterfield
wins the game at Briggs Stadium.

1953
At St. Louis, the Cardinals pound Preacher Row for 6 runs in the 2nd enroute
to a 9-3 win over the Dodgers. It is the Cards first win against Roe after
10 straight losses. They last beat him August 28, 1950. Last night they
beat Erskine after losing 7 straight to the lefty.

1954
With a pin in his shoulder, Ted Williams returns to action after breaking
his collarbone in spring training and is hitless in two at-bats against
Baltimore. The O's win, 2-1, behind Coleman.

1955
New York's Irv Noren hits an inside-the-park grand slam in an 8-4 victory
over the A's. New York wins the nitecap to sweep the A's. Mantle is 4 for
9 for the afternoon and is hitting .311.

Chicago's Dick Donovan tosses his 3rd shut out of the season, beating the
Senators, 3-0.

After the Braves win the lidlifter with the Phils, 6-5, Philadelphia comes
back in the nitecap to win, 9-1, and break their 13-game losing streak. Robin
Roberts is the victor. Bruton's leadoff HR is the only run off Roberts.

1956
Sal Maglie, obtained on waivers by Cleveland last season from the Giants,
is shipped to the Dodgers for a hundred dollars after impressing Brooklyn in
an exhibition game. The 'Barber' will post a 13-5 record along with a 2.89
ERA for the eventual NL Champs, finishing second to teammate Don Newcombe
in the balloting for both the Cy Young and MVP awards.

The White Sox send infielder Jim Brideweser and 3B Bob Kennedy to Detroit
for infielder Fred Hatfield and outfielder Jim Delsing.

1959
Massachusetts marks the 100th anniversary of the first college baseball game,
between Amherst and Williams. Teams reenact the original contest.

1960
Two days after being traded from the Phillies to the Cubs, Don Cardwell
pitches a no-hitter. Thanks to three outstanding defensive catches, one a
brilliant, leaping catch of Carl Sawatski's drive by RF George Altman in
the 8th inning saves Cardwell's gem. Another is Walt Moryn's game-ending
grab. Ernie Banks' HR paces the 4-0 win, the first no-hitter against the Cards
since May 11, 1919. Caldwell, a Winston-Salem, NC native becomes the first
pitcher to keep the opponents hitless in a first start after being traded.

At Cincinnati, the Reds are down 9-1 when P Raul Sanchez starts a brawl
by plunking 3 of 4 Phils batters in the 8th inning, the last batter being
P Gene Conley. Phils manager Gene Mauch then charges the mound to tackle
Sanchez. Both dugouts empty with fights all around. The most cinematic is 2B
Billy Martin, 5'11", taking on the 6'11" Conley, though future Hall of Famers
Frank Robinson and Robin Roberts is a close second. It takes 12 minutes to
restore order. The Phils romp 14-3, then lose 5-1 in the doubleheader.

1961
The Alou brothers and Cepeda lead an 18-hit attack as San Francisco overpowers
the Cubs, 14-1. Dick Ellsworth gives up 6 runs in the 1st without retiring
a batter. Cepeda hits 2 homers and a double and drives in 5 runs, while
Felipe hits his 1st grand slam and brother Matty his first ML homer. Matty
will combine with Jesus in 1965 to homer in the same game. Mike McCormick
is the easy winner.

1962
Cubs P Barney Schultz ties Roy Face's ML record by relieving in his 9th
consecutive game for Chicago. Today's effort doesn't help as the Cubs lose,
6-5, in 13 innings against the Mets. Roger Craig, enroute to a 10-24 year,
is the winner, while Tony Balsamo loses to notch his only career decision.

1963

to put the Yankees on the board. Mantle later scores the winning run as
New York wins, 4-3.

1965
Haywood Sullivan replaces Mel McGaha as skipper of the A's.

but it's not enough. The Reds win, 8-7.

1968

Sox play the first of nine games in Milwaukee. A crowd of 23,403 fans watches
the Pale Hose lose to the Angels, 4-2, in the first American League contest
to take place in Milwaukee since 1901. Rain shortens the game to five innings.

1969
Willie Horton leaves the Detroit bench during a 2-1 win against Chicago
and goes AWOL for 4 days.

With one out in the 9th, Cesar Tovar lines a single to stop the no-hit bid

over the Twins.

1970
After going 0-4 on Opening Day, Rico Carty proceeds to get a hit in 31
straight games. This season's batting champ's sixth-inning RBI single at
Crosley Field sets the record for the longest hitting streak for the Braves
since the franchise relocated to Atlanta.

After the Mets have a day off, ace Tom Seaver matches Gentry by allowing
one hit in beating the Phillies and Woodie Fryman, 4-0. The two consecutive
one-hitters tie a ML record.

1971

and hurls his first career no-hitter in beating Kansas City 3-0. For C Jeff
Torborg, it is his 3rd no-hitter. SS Rudy Meoli preserves the no-no with a
spectacular over the shoulder catch in the 8th. It is the first of a record
seven no-hitters the 'Ryan Express' will throw during his career including
another one in two months.

1976
In his first major league start, rookie right-hander Mark Fidrych throws a
complete game two-hitter in the Tigers' 2-1 victory over Cleveland. 'The
Bird', who holds the Tribe hitless for the first six innings, amuses his
teammates and delights the Detroit fans with his unorthodox antics, which
includes talking to the ball, and he tamps down the mound before toeing
the rubber each inning.

At Cincinnati, the Mets' Tom Seaver loses, 2-0, to the Reds as Santo Alcala
pitches a 4-hitter.

At Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, the Indians' Len Barker pitches a perfect
game defeating the Blue Jays, 3-0, before just 7,290 fans on a rainy
night. Last year's AL strikeout leader, Barker fans 11. It is the 11th time
in major league history the feat has been accomplished (and the 9th time
in the 20th century), and the first time in 13 years since it's been done
(Catfish Hunter - 1968).

1982
Pirate pitcher Rick Rhoden makes his 12-9 win over the Reds a little easier
when he doubles and homers in the Bucs' 9-run 3rd inning. Johnny Ray drives
in 5 runs in the big inning. The Reds make it close with 8 runs in the 8th
and 9th.

1984
It's a day for hitting pitchers. Good hitting Tim Lollar leads the way by
collecting all 4 RBIs, but his Padres lose 6-4. The Cards win 9-1 over the
Braves as Joaquin Andujar, a poor hitter, hits a grand slam. Just before his
blast, Andujar looked into the Cards' dugout, then gestured to the RF stands.

1989

one by Worthington.

1992

4-1 win over the Dodgers.

1993
The Expos retire Rusty Staub's uniform prior to the game with the Mets.

1996

hits, and Edgar Martinez drives in 4 runs. A wild Key takes his 5th straight
loss, while Yankee reliever Mariano Rivera records four outs to stretch
his runless innings to 21 2/3. The Yanks will place Key on the 15 day DL.

Denny Neagle, allowing 4 hits in 7 innings, wins his 5th straight game to
give Pittsburgh a 3-0 win over the Braves. The Braves have now been shut
out 5 times, one more than all of last year. The Braves lose more than the
game when OF David Justice dislocates his right shoulder swinging at a pitch
in the 2nd inning. The shoulder has never healed from an injury last year,
and Justice will undergo surgery that will sideline him for the year.

After a 2-hour delay in Milwaukee because of fog, Frank Thomas leads the way
with 6 RBI as the White Sox bang the Brewers, 20-8. This ties a 1975 mark
for the most runs given up by Milwaukee in a game. The Sox, with 21 hits,
score 6 runs in the 2nd and another 6 in the 6th.

of the first 7 innings, to clip the Angels, 17-6. Mike Stanley matches Mo's

unless he was traded to a U.S. team.

plate appearance in yesterday's game.
