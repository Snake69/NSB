1901
The Colts (aka the Remnants - the Chicago Tribune) lose to New York, 6-3,
to run their current road trip record to 2-13. Both wins occurred in a DH
against Brooklyn.

1903
Seeing that George Davis is playing for the Giants, Ed Delahanty decides
to jump to New York too. Leaving the Nationals in Detroit, he boards an
eastbound train. He is put off the train for rowdy, and possibly drunken,
behavior at Niagara Falls. When he tries to walk across the railroad bridge
over the Niagara River, he falls to his death. He had a 16-year .346 batting
average and once hit four homers in one game.

Pitcher Jack Doscher, making his debut with the Chicago Cubs, is the
first son of a former ML player to also play in the ML. Father Herm was
a third baseman with Troy, Chicago and Cleveland before the turn of the
century. Jack loses today at Philadelphia, 7-2, and will end the season
with the Brooklyn Superbas.

1904
Highly touted rookie Walter Clarkson, the top college (Harvard) pitcher and
brother of 2 major leaguers, makes his ML debut. He limits the Senators to
8 hits, but the Highlanders manage just 4 hits and lose, 3-2, in the 1st of 2.

The Boston Americans send infielder Bill O'Neill and cash to Washington for
11-year vet Kip Selbach. Selbach almost went to the Highlanders in early May,
but the deal was nixed by then-new Washington manager Patsy Donovan.

1906
In a battle of the tailenders, Boston beats Washington, 4-3, behind Cy Young
in game 1, and Washington then whips them, 17-3, in game 2 in a game called
after 7 innings so the Americans can catch a train. Dave Altizer scores 5
runs for the Senators in game 2 and Jones has a triple and double.

In a pair of 1-0 games, the Reds' Chick Fraser beats the Cubs, while
Boston beats the Phillies on rookie Johnny Bates' homerun in the 9th off
Togie Pittinger.

At Philadelphia, the Highlanders and Athletics split a pair. The A's take
the opener, 5-4, with a bases loaded walk in the 9th. In game 2, the New
Yorkers are leading 5-1 in the 9th with 2 outs in the bottom of the frame
when a forfeit is declared when fans surge onto the field.

Reds president Hermann, furious at the charge of Barney Dreyfuss of the
Pirates, declares that the Pirates can have Ed Phelps for nothing. Dreyfuss
had charged that Phelps was awarded to the Reds because of Hermann's $6000
wager against the Pirates as a pennant winner. Phelps is now the property
of the Boston Americans, but Hermann will pay the $1500 to get his release.

1908
The Giants rally for two runs in the 7th off Phillies starter Bill Foxen,
and win, 4-3. Mathewson wins his 14th.

Well, they didn't get him to beat Chicago. Pittsburgh's Irv Young, acquired
two weeks ago from Boston, loses his 11th straight to Chicago, 3-0, in game
1. His streak dates back to August 6, 1905. The Pirates claw back in game 2,
winning 9-4, to stay a half game behind first-place Chicago.

1909
The White Sox steal 12 bases in the course of a 15-3 win over St. Louis. Three
are steals of home, including one by P Ed Walsh in the 6th inning, for a
modern ML record.

After the Phils take game 1 over Boston, 5-4, Boston pitcher Al Mattern
pitches a 2-hit 4-0 win over the Quakers. Mattern will allow a league-high
322 hits in 316 1/3 innings this year.

1911
Detroit pounds out a 14-6 victory over Cleveland as Ty Cobb, hitting in
his 40th straight game, has 3 hits and 3 runs.

1912
At New York, Boston's Larry Gardner legs out two inside-the-park homers
but the Red Sox still lose, 9-7, to New York.

1913
Christy Mathewson allows 13 hits but the Giants continue to pummel the
slipping Phils, winning 8-4. Matty gives up no walks to run his streak to
34 innings.

1915
The last place A's continue to dismantle, selling Jack Barry, part of the
"$100,000 infield," for $8,000 to Boston.

For the first time since the 1911 World Series, Jack Coombs pitches against
Christy Mathewson. Now with the Dodgers, Coombs wins the duel, shutting
out the Giants, 3-0. Two singles and a Zack Wheat triple in the 8th is
the difference.

1918
In Washington, Red Sox star Babe Ruth quits the team after arguing with
manager Ed Barrow. This follows a 3-0 loss to Washington's Harry Harper
in which the Babe, playing CF, goes hitless in two at-bats and makes an
error. Harry Harper cops his 2nd win in the series and his 7th in a row,
beating Guy Bush.

The first-place Yankees are "dipped in the whitewash vat" by the A's young
Bob Geary, who allows just 3 singles in the 5-0 victory. The host Mackmen,
led by Merlin Kopp, rattle 3 Yankee pitchers for 10 hits, handing the loss
to Slim Love. Kopp is 4 for 4 with 4 runs and a stolen base. The Yanks
maintain their two-game lead over the Red Sox and Cleveland.

At the Polo Grounds, Long Cy Williams clouts a three-run homer in the 7th,
off Slim Sallee, to lead the Phillies to 5-2 win over the Giants. But
several bright spots for the Giants include the appearances of Laughing
Larry Doyle and Ferdie Schupp, both out of the lineup for months. Doyle
was hitting .420 when he was hit by a pitch on May 4th and has been in the
hospital for much of the interim. Before the game, each of the 20 Philley
players was presented with a new wrist watch because Bob Meusel hit the
Ingersoll watch sign on the outfield fence the other day.

In Boston, proceedings started to determine the status of professional
baseball players under the new work or fight rules. Summons were sent to 14
Boston Braves - all the players except Wally Rehg, Ray Powell and Joe Kelly,
who will enter the U.S. Navy Reserve this week. Three other players - Buck
Herzog, Ed Konetchy and Tom Hughes - are beyond the draft age. Meanwhile,
the Braves host the Dodgers. Burleigh Grimes allows just three hits and
tallies three himself as he spins a 4-0 win.

1920
With the Dodgers winning, the Reds maintain their two game lead with a 6-5
extra-inning win over the Cubs. Jimmy Ring goes all the way for the win,
helped by Kopf's three runs scored.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants pound out six homers to earn a split with
the Braves. Boston takes the opener, 9-7 in 11 innings, but the Giants
cop the 2nd game, 13-4. In the first game, Boston scores two in the 9th to
take the lead, New York uses homers by Larry Doyle and George Burns to tie,
but reliever Phil Douglas gives it back in the 11th. Douglas starts game
2 and is more effective, taking the victory to end the day at 1-1. Larry
Doyle is 4 for 4 in game 2, including another homer. Benny Kauff also
homers in game 2, but it does him no good ... after the game, the Giants
trade Kauff, along with Wilbur Hubbell and cash, to Toronto for OF Vernon
Spencer. Kauff, a .300 hitter, never lived up to his reputation. Kauff will
later be accused of receiving stolen goods in New York and newly appointed
commissioner Landis will bar him for life. The Giants also waive utility
infielder Edward Sicking to the Reds.

The Yankees are outhit by the A's 10 to 7, but Philadelphia errors give
New York a 7-4 win. Starter Slim Harriss, with 6 innings, takes the loss
for the Mackman, the first of his ML record tying 14 straight losses to
the Yankees. The Yankees maintain a slim .004 lead over the Indians.

1922
A's OF Tilly Walker hits 2 HRs, giving him 4 in 2 days, as the A's lose to
New York, 9-3. He will finish with 37 for the year, 2 ahead of Ruth. The
Athletics, with the AL's winningest pitcher in Eddie Rommel (27-13) and
losingest in Slim Harriss (9-20) will lead the AL with 114 HRs and climb
out of the cellar.

1927
The Senators complete a sweep of 4 games over the A's, winning 4-2, and
climb into 2nd place on a 9-game winning streak. The Mackmen have now lost
7 in a row. Bob Burke, starting his first game for the Nats, is the winner
over Rube Walberg.

The Yanks run their win streak to 7 by beating the Red Sox, 3-2. Bob Meusel's
double in the 6th scores Gehrig with the winning tally. Boston has now lost
14 in a row.

At Boston, the Giants play their 3rd successive doubleheader with the Braves,
splitting again. Joe Bush, staging a comeback with his 7th major league
team, wins the opener for New York, 4-1. The Braves take the nitecap, 2-1,
in 10 innings when Eddie Moore's squeeze play brings home the winning run.

The Cubs move into 2nd place by beating the Cardinals, 7-4. A 4-run 7th
drives Cubs starter Sheriff Blake from the mound, but Guy Bush wins in relief.

At Pittsburgh, Clyde Barnhart's 2-run homer off Art Nehf in the 9th wins
for the Pirates, 7-6 over the Reds. Mike Cvengros is the winning hurler. The
crippled Pirates lose another starter when 2B Larry Grantham retires in the
4th inning with an injured leg; Heinie Groh, making his first appearance
for Pittsburgh, replaces him and collects two hits.

1930
Carl Reynolds of the White Sox hits 3 consecutive HRs in three consecutive
innings (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd) - just the 2nd player to do so - and drives
home 8 runs in the 2nd game of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. The Sox win,
15-4. Two of the HRs are hit inside-the-park, in the 1st and 3rd innings. The
feat is second-billed, as headlines tell of Ruth tearing a nail off his
finger on the OF screen trying for Reynolds' 2nd homer. In the opener,
Ruth has 2 hits, including his 31st homer in the Yanks 5-1 win. Roy Sherid
allows just 3 Sox hits.

1931
Babe Ruth homers - his 19th - to drive in a run for the 11th consecutive
game as the Yankees drub Detroit, 13-1. Ben Chapman follows Ruth with another
HR. Ruth has 18 RBIs in the string, but will be collared in his next game.

1933
Carl Hubbell pitches an entire 18-inning shutout for the Giants over the
Cardinals to tie Walter Johnson's ML record for the longest 1-0 victory. He
strikes out 12 and walks none, allowing only 6 hits in a duel with Tex
Carleton, who goes the first 16 innings. Jess Haines relieves in the
17th and in the 18th gives up a single to Joe Moore, a sacrifice bunt
to Gus Mancuso, and an intentional pass to Travis Jackson. Hubbell then
forces at 2nd, and a single by Hughey Critz ends it. In game 2, played in
semi-darkness, Roy Parmelee matches Hubbell and wins 1-0 on a Johnny Vergez
HR. The notoriously wild Giants' pitcher does not issue a walk and strikes
out 13 to beat Dizzy Dean, who is pitching on a day's rest. The Cards go
a record 27 innings in the two games with no walks. Not until 1950, will
the Cards be shut out again in a twin bill, and again it'll be NY.

The Brooklyn Dodgers sweep a pair from the Chicago Cubs, winning 7-3 and
4-3. Dodgers catcher Al Lopez homers in the first game. In game two, Lopez
steals home with two outs in the 9th and Cubs ace Charlie Root on the mound
in relief.

The A's Jimmie Foxx is the second American leaguer in history - and the
2nd in 5 weeks - to collect 6 long hits in a DH, though one game is 10
innings. Double X hits 4 homers, a triple and a double in the 2 games,
a twinbill split with the host Browns. The A's take the opener, 6-5, and
then lose, 11-6.

1934
At Wrigley Field, the Cardinals protest a game with the Cubs in a dispute
over a delayed call on a bases loaded infield fly by veteran umpire Bill
Klem. Scoring 4 runs the Cubs drive Paul Dean from the mound in a riotous
7th that sees Klem toss manager Frankie Frisch, coach Mike Gonzales and
Dizzy Dean. The game is suspended with two out in the bottom of the seventh
inning with the Cubs ahead 5-1. The Cubs win 7-4, but the end of the game
will be replayed July 31st.

1935
After 7 straight hits, the Cubs' Gabby Hartnett lines out in the 6th against
the Reds to end his hit streak. The Cubs win, 9-3.

1936
Cleveland's Roy Hughes scores 5 runs and OF Bruce Campbell, recently returning
from a bout with spinal meningitis, goes 6 for 6 in the first game of a
doubleheader. Campbell singles in his first AB in the nightcap. The Indians
sweep two, winning 14-6 and 4-2.

1937
At Wrigley, Gabby Hartnett clouts the 200th homer of his career, a 2-run
four-bagger coming in the 8th inning off Pittsburgh's Red Lucas. Augie Galan
follows suit with a 2-run shot in the 9th inning to give the Cubs an 8-7 win.

Rollie Hemsley is suspended by the Browns for violation of training rules. It
is not the first time the fun-loving catcher has been suspended.

1939
In a doubleheader with the Dodgers before 51,435 at the Polo Grounds, the
fireworks start 2 days early. The Dodgers take an uneventful opener 3-2, but
in the 4th inning of the nitecap, Dodger player-manager Leo Durocher ends
the inning by grounding into a DP and spikes 1B Zeke Bonura as he crosses
the bag. Bonura takes off after Durocher, chases him down the RF line,
and throws his mitt at him. He finally wrestles him to the ground. Both
players are ejected, and the Giants go on to win 6-4. To Bonura's charge
of intentional spiking, the Lip retorts, "If that big clown hadn't got his
foot in my way, I wouldn't have been close to him."

1940
Detroit takes over 1st place by beating the White Sox, 10-9, taking advantage
of 10 walks handed out. Meanwhile, the Indians lose their 2nd straight to
the Browns, 5-3.

At Boston, the Red Sox split a pair with the A's, losing 4-3 before winning
15-9. The Sox score in 6 of the 8 innings in the nitecap getting homers
from Foxx and Cronin. Al Simmons hits his 1st homer of the year for the A's.

1941
At Yankee Stadium, Joe DiMaggio extends his consecutive-game hitting streak
to 45 by hitting a HR, his only hit of the game, off Boston's Dick Newsome,
surpassing Willie Keeler's all-time record (1897 with the Orioles). Newsome
started in place of Lefty Grove, who asked for the day off because of the
95 degree heat. New York wins, 8-4.

1943
In a 3-2 loss to Washington, White Sox 30-year-old rookie Guy Curtwright has
his 26-game hitting streak stopped. It's an AL rookie record but Curtwright
falls one game short of the club record set by Luke Appling. He will hit
.291 in this, his only season, and his rookie hitting streak will last
until Garciaparra, in 1997.

The Indians score in just one inning - the 3rd - against the Yankees,
but they tally 12 runs, and Allie Reynolds gives up just 3 hits to win, 12-0.

1946
The Yankees nip the Red Sox 2-1 before a Stadium crowd of 69,107. Spud
Chandler walks 9 in the first 4 innings but takes a no-hitter into the 9th
before Bobby Doerr hits a one-out single.

The Dodgers win their 7th straight, beating the Phils, 3-2, at Ebbets Field,

Pirates, 8-6.

1948

3 hits and goes all the way for the win. Tom McBride makes 12 putouts to
set the AL record for POs in LF in extra innings. The Yanks drop 2 games
behind 1st-place Cleveland and 1 1/2 games behind the A's.

1949
Whoops. Cubs Andy Pafko is tagged out in the dugout after his line drive had
been dropped. Andy thought the ball was caught and headed for a seat. It's
no wonder the Pirates win, 8-3, as Tiny Bonham outpitches Monk Dubiel.

Monte Kennedy of the New York Giants shuts out the Brooklyn Dodgers,
16-0. Kennedy contributes a seventh-inning grand slam to his cause. The 16-run
margin sets a club record for biggest shutout win which will stand until 2000.

1950
Indian great Bob Feller wins his 200th ML game, 5-3, over Detroit in the
2nd game of a doubleheader split. Detroit wins the opener, 8-5, for their

ML at-bat. Del Ennis hits a 3-run HR off starter Clem Labine in the 8th
for the win.

1956
Ted Williams is 4 for 5 raising his average to .372 as the Red Sox come
from behind to beat the Senators, 3-2.

Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1957
At Wrigley Field, Cubs OF Lee Walls hits for the cycle, but the Reds win

The Women's Christian Temperance Union charges that baseball has become
"beerball," since so many broadcasts are sponsored by breweries.

1958
The Dodgers split a doubleheader with St. Louis, winning 3-2 before dropping

Vern Law, making his 1st start in more than 3 weeks, is lifted in the
6th and Haddix wins in relief. Bobby Shantz pitches a 5-hitter to win the
nitecap as the Bucs score 6 unearned runs off Marichal. The Giants, 2 1/2
games back yesterday, will be 9 out on the evening of July 8.

Pitcher Glen Hobbie and Tony Taylor each hit a pair of homers for the Cubs,
and pinch hitter Richie Ashburn's bases-loaded single in the 8th brings
home the deciding run. The Cubs edge the Cardinals, 10-9.

1962
In the first game of a doubleheader, P Johnny Podres of the Dodgers ties the
modern NL record with 8 consecutive strikeouts in a 5-1 win. Stan Williams

the 9th to beat the Cubs, 4-3.

1963
Nipping Curt Simmons and St. Louis 1-0, Don Drysdale puts the Dodgers into
first place for good.

In a classic pitching matchup in San Francisco between 2 Hall of Famers, the
Braves' Warren Spahn gives up 9 hits in 15 1/3 innings, while Juan Marichal
allows 8 hits in 16 innings while striking out 10. With the score tied at
the end of 15. When asked by his manager at the end of 15 if he could go
another inning Juan Marichal said, "If that old guy in the Braves dugout
can do it, so can I." Willie Mays' round-tripper off Spahn at 12:31 A.M. in
the bottom of the 16th gives Marichal a 1-0 win, the NL's longest win ended
by a HR. Both pitchers go the distance in one of the greatest matchups ever.

1966
Frank Howard, Don Lock and Ken McMullen hit consecutive HRs with 2 outs in
the 6th inning, and Mike McCormick pitches a complete game, as Washington

in the 9th.

1967
In front of a crowd of 40,464 at Wrigley Field, Ferguson Jenkins (11-5)
pitches the Cubs into a first-place tie with St. Louis by defeating Cincinnati
4-1. The Cubs have won 17 of 19 games. After Chicago's victory, many of the
40,464 patrons stay in the ballpark awaiting the outcome of the Cards/Mets
game. When the results are posted with a New York win, which puts the Cubs
in first place by half a game, the enthusiastic fans refuse to leave the
'Friendly Confines' until the flags above the scoreboard are changed,
a task usually done the next day, to reflect the home team's position at
the top of the standings.

1969
Reds hurler Jerry Arrigo ties a NL record by hitting 3 Braves in the 2nd
inning of a 9-4 Atlanta win. Reds hurlers plunk two more and the Braves

Higgins is the winning pitcher.

Detroit's Joe Niekro no-hits the Yankees until Horace Clarke singles in
the 9th inning. The Tigers win 5-0. This is the 3rd time in the month that

(June 4th) and Boston's Sonny Siebert (June 19th).

for Chris Short. The opener is the 6,000th game played at the ancient stadium.

1972
Minnesota's Jim Kaat, sporting a 10-2 record and a 2.07 ERA, breaks his
pitching hand while sliding. He will miss the remainder of the season. Katt

2 are out in the 9th. George Scott then clouts a 2-run homer, and Danny
Darwin follows with another dinger.

1976
The Astros outslug the Reds at Riverfront Stadium, 10-9, in 14 innings,

rout of Atlanta). Pete Rose has 5 hits for the Reds.

1977
The White Sox Jim Spencer clubs 2 HRs - one a grand slam - against the

14th. Chicago wins, 13-8.

1978
Ron Guidry wins his 13th consecutive game, the best start in Yankee
history, in beating Detroit, 3-2. With the Yankees down 2-0, Mickey Rivers'
long drive to right is caught by a fan reaching down to take it away from
Detroit's Mickey Stanley. The fan drops the ball and Stanley, waiting for an
interference call, fails to retrieve. Rivers motors for an inside-the-park
homer and New York ties the game 2-2, eventually winning it.

1979
Don Kessinger (46-60) is fired mid-season as the player-manager of the
White Sox, and will be replaced by rookie skipper Tony La Russa, who

of the season. In three weeks he will be fired and replaced by Dave Garcia.

and Phil Niekro join Jim and Gaylord Perry as the only pitching brother
combinations to win at least 200 games per pitcher.

P Zane Smith to Montreal for 3 minor leaguers. The Braves will move Dale
Murphy back to RF.

1990

record of 21 with Don Sutton.

1991
After grounding out in a 4-1 loss to the Dodgers, Padres C Benito Santiago
throws his batting helmet in disgust. The helmet bounces into the dugout,

over to bean coach Greg Riddoch, giving him a concussion. Santiago is
fined $300.

1993
At Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, the latest game in major league history
ends at 4:40 am as relief pitcher Mitch Williams, in his first at-bat of
the season, singles home the winning run in the tenth inning giving the
Phillies a 6-5 victory over the Padres. The game, which started at 1:26 am
due to three rain delays in game 1 of the twin bill, eclipses the 3:35 mark
established in Atlanta on July 4, 1985 in a game which ended with fireworks
after the Mets beat the Braves in 19 innings, 16-13.

In a pre-game ceremony at the ballpark, Royals Stadium is officially renamed

Ruth's uniform".

1996

Seattle 11-6. 1B Jason Giambi leads the way with 5 hits.

The Reds put P Pete Schourek on the 15-day DL, but he'll undergo elbow
surgery on July 17th and miss the rest of the season. The Reds' other ace,
Jose Rijo, recovering from surgery last August, has yet to pitch off the
mound for Birmingham.

The Marlins sign Domingo Aramboles, 16-year-old Dominican pitcher, to a
contract, giving him a $5,500 signing bonus. Aramboles produces a birth
certificate showing he's 16, but later it is discovered that he is only 14,
and the Commissioner's office will nullify the contract. His 1.71 minor league
ERA will earn him a big bonus when he signs in 1998. Josephang Bernhardt,
another Latin ball player who will produce a phony birth certificate,
will be taken away from Tampa Bay and sign with Toronto for $750,000.

An MRI on Tony Gwynn shows fraying of the tendon in his right heel. The

Sanders hit back to back homers in the 1st inning and Phil Nevin and Carlos
Baerga hit back-to-back pinch homers in the 9th inning, tying the mark
for most pinch HRs (2) in a game by a team, as San Diego defeats Colorado,
15-3. Jeffy Barry hits a pinch HR in the 8th for the Rockies to tie the mark
(3) of pinch homers by 2 teams.

Hey Mom! Texas righty pitcher Jeff Zimmerman defeats his brother Jordan,
a lefty for Seattle, 7-6.

In the Cards' 9-5 loss to the Diamondbacks, Mark McGwire belts a pair of
homers, his 56th multi-homer game, which moves him into 4th place on this
list ahead of Foxx.

Umpire Tom Hallion is suspended for 3 games for his actions during an
argument with Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May on June
26th. The dispute began when Rockies pitcher Mike DeJean, while walking to
his dugout complained to third base umpire Terry Tata about a check-swing
call, and home plate ump Hallion told DeJean to get in the dugout. National
League President Len Coleman suspends Tom Hallion without pay for bumping
Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May during the ensuing
argument. Officials couldn't recall another suspension of an umpire for an
on-field dispute. In 1990, NL president Bill White was prepared to suspend
umpire Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the field,
but commissioner Fay Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed.

At Shea Stadium, Mets fan Gregory Sweeney is arrested and charged with
reckless endangerment after he throws a ball back onto the field which
Braves reliever John Rocker had tossed into the stands. A few days later,

nothing more than following a baseball tradition of returning an unsolicited
and unwanted souvenir.

At the SkyDome, Manny Ramirez belts a 3-run homer in the 1st and the Red Sox
roll to a 16-4 clipping of the Blue Jays. Manny's blast travels 491 feet,
the longest homer in Dome history - it is his 7th of the year against the
Jays, the most an opponent has hit in a season - and his 5th at the Dome,
which also ties an opponents record. Stynes has 3 hits, 3 runs and 3 errors
in the hitfest. Nomo is the winner.

2002
A record-tying dozen HRs are hit at Chicago's Comiskey Park by the White
Sox and the Tigers, the same two teams which set the major league record
for homers in a game with 12 (6 apiece) at Tiger Stadium on May 28, 1995.
Dmitri Young and Magglio Ordonez connect for a deuce with Magglio's 2nd a
grand slam. Todd Richie gives up 5 runs in 7 innings for the win. The White
Sox batter the Tigers, 17-9.

At Coors Field every Giant starter gets at least one hit with the #8 hitter,
OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, going 5 for 6 with a pair of homeruns including a
first-inning grand slam. The former Japanese big leaguer will finish the
season hitting just two more homers and driving in nine more runs. The
Giants score 8 runs in the 1st inning on their way to an 18-5 rout of the
Rockies. Damon Minor, Shinjo and Reggie Sanders each homer twice to tie a
ML record. The Giants become the 16th team to have 3 players with multiple
HRs in the same game.

At Cincinnati, the Astros and Reds play the first inning with non-regulation
baseballs, the result of a mix-up by an attendant in the umpires' locker
room. The attendant did not notice the word "practice" stenciled on the
144 balls he rubbed up for the game; the practice balls generally have
defects such as irregular stitching or weight deviations. Astros pitcher
Wade Miller notices the practice ball when warming up and informs ump Mark
Hirschback, who rules that the practice balls must be used in the bottom
of the 1st before switching. Reds starter Wade Miller served up a homer
in the 1st to Lance Berkman, who hits another in his next at-bat, good
for 5 RBIs. He leads the NL with 74 ribbies. The Astros win in the 10th,
6-5. Austin Kerns has 4 hits and Adam Dunn a homer for the Reds.

A combined total of 62 HRs are hit in today's games, breaking the old ML
mark of 57 set on April 7, 2000. A record 9 players have multiple HR games,
breaking the previous mark of 8.

becomes the second Venezuelan to manage in the big leagues.

The Pirates take two games from the Brewers, winning by scores of 8-1 and
13-2. OF Jason Bay drives home 8 runs in the 2nd game, the 2nd time he has
done so in less than a year. He has only 48 career RBIs.

The Baltimore Orioles beat Philadelphia, 7-6, in 16 innings. The Orioles'
pitching staff registers 19 Philly strikeouts and issues 18 walks.

2005
In one of the most severe penalties ever imposed by the commissioner's
office for on-field behavior, Kenny Rogers is suspended for 20 games and
fined $50,000 for actions which sends a cameraman to the hospital and
launches a police investigation. The veteran southpaw, who will appeal the
MLB decision, is selected by his peers to be a member of the American League
All-Star squad scheduled to be played next week in Detroit.

2006
The Red Sox edge the Marlins, 4-3. The win gives Boston a 16-2 mark
against the NL this season, tying the highest victory total in interleague
history. The Twins match that mark with an 8-0 win over the Brewers.

holds the all-time mark at 84 games in a row.

At Wrigley Field, the Cubs outslug the White Sox to win, 15-11, in a game
featuring nine homeruns. Winning pitcher Carlos Zambrano hits his 3rd of
the year, off loser Mark Buehrle. In a birthday present to Angel Pagan,
Sox reliever Cliff Politte serves up two gopher balls. Juan Uribe has 4
RBIs for the Sox, including a 3-run homer.

At Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Bombers belt the Mets, 16-7. Carlos Beltran
has four hits and a pair of homers for the Mets, while Alex Rodriguez hits
a pair, including a grand slam, for the Yanks to drive in 7 runs.

AL's player, pitcher and rookie of the month for June. It is the 1st time
that all 3 players have come from the same team.

The Republicans defeat the Democrats, 12-1, in the annual Roll Call
Congressional Baseball Game at RFK Stadium. The Republican victory is
their sixth straight and their eighth out of the last 10 contests. Illinois
Congressman John Shimkus, pitches a seven-hit complete game for the Grand
Old Party. Roll Call, the congressional newspaper, began sponsoring the
game annually in 1962 and, since then, the Republicans have dominated the
Democrats going 31-13 with one tie. The game was originally organized in
1909 by former major-leaguer John Tener, a Republican Congressman from
Pennsylvania, but was played only intermittently until Roll Call stepped in.

2013
Homer Bailey becomes the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan to throw two
no-hitters before another major league hurler accomplishes the feat when
he gives up just a walk in the Reds' 3-0 victory over the Giants at Great
American Ballpark, beating Tim Lincecum, who will throw a no-no eleven
days later. Last September, the 27-year-old Cincinnati right-hander,
the youngest pitcher to have pitched two no-hitters in his career, hurled
the first no-hitter in PNC Park history, a dramatic 1-0 victory over the
hometown Pirates.

2017
Mookie Betts of the Red Sox tied a Major League record by recording eight
RBIs from the lead-off spot against the Toronto Blue Jays. The others
to achieve this mark were Ronnie Belliard (Colorado Rockies, 2003), Jim
Northrup (Detroit Tigers, 1973), Bill Glynn (Cleveland Indians, 1954)
and Augie Bergamo (St. Louis Cardinals, 1945).
