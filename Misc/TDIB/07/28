1903
Boston's Vic Willis outpitches Mathewson to beat the Giants, 5-3. Third
sacker Ed Gremminger solves Matty, banging out a single, double, homer and
sacrifice to lead Boston.

In Cleveland's 10-2 win over St. Louis, Bill Bradley laces three triples
to tie the AL mark set by teammate Elmer Flick last year, a record that
will be tied many times, but never broken.

1906
At Galveston, the Sand Crabs win the opener from Austin, 4-1 (South Texas
League). In the 2nd game, Galveston, down 2-0 in the 8th, forfeits the game
when management has umpire Wright arrested for using foul language. "The
language said to have been used was such as to offend even the blase old
rounder, to say nothing of the many ladies in the audience. The action
of the management in having Wright arrested, even at the expense of the
forfeiture of the game, was commended by all present when the reason of it
all became known." (Galveston Chronicle)

1907
The Reds make it three straight from the Giants, winning 8-3 and 3-1. In
game 1, winning pitcher Jake Weimer adds insult to injury with a swipe of
home. An incensed John McGraw gets into a fight with a park security man
and belts him. Police break it up and no arrests are made.

1908
Hooks Wiltse and Vic Willis lock horns and the Giants and Pirates duel for
16 innings before the game is called, 2-2, because of darkness. Wagner is
0 for 6 but drives home a run with a "sacrifice fly."

Walter Johnson's (1-5) recuperation from his operation seems complete as he
pitches 15 innings against the Browns with neither team scoring. Washington
pulls out a 2-1 victory in the 16th as Johnson K's 15, Big Train's highest
strikeout total for his career. He will win 11 of his next 13 decisions.

In a 4-2 win at Boston, Bob Ewing of the Reds hits a homer that travels
3 miles (as noted by Rhodes & Snyder). The ball goes over the LF fence at
South Street Grounds and lands in a passing mail car railroad train. The
train travels 3 miles before reaching its destination.

1909
Brooklyn's Jim Pastorius no-hits the Phillies until pinch hitter Marty
Martel laces a one-out triple in the 9th inning. Pastorius wins 4-0.

1910
Philadelphia's George McQuillan allows 8 hits but the Giants score only in
the 9th to lose, 3-1. Mathewson takes the loss, despite allowing just 4 hits.

1911
Charley "Victory" Faust shows up at the Giants' hotel in St. Louis asking
for a tryout. Manager John McGraw observes the "pitcher," who obviously is no
player, and carries him on the team as an unofficial "mascot," and good luck
charm. But the Giants lose to the Cards today, 5-2, with the help of 5 errors.

1913
At Robison Field, Chisty Mathewson outpitches Bob Harmon for a 4-0 Giants
win. Matty allows 4 hits and walks 2.

1914
The Red Sox acquire lefty Vean Gregg (9-3), a 20-game winner the past three
years, from Cleveland for (Adam) Rankin Johnson, Fritz Coumbe and catcher
Ben Egan.

1917
In a doubleheader at St. Louis, the Red Sox sweep, winning both games
by 3-2 scores, the 2nd in 11 innings. In the 20 innings, not one Red Sox
batter strikes out. Another oddity is in game 2, as Ernie Shore is called
out twice when hit with a batted ball, once in the 3rd inning when running
from 1st to 2nd base and once in the 5th when he bunts and "he caressed the
pill on the way to first." Ernie sets an AL record and is the only player
to do it since 1890.

1918
In a match billed as the first major league game ever played in Montreal
- though an exhibition - the Boston Braves edge the Cubs, 3-2, before a
packed crowd at Atwater Park. To the delight of the fans, Cubs twirler Roy
Walker walks Red Smith, a former Royal, with the bases loaded in the 9th,
then passes Bull Henry to force home the winner. The teams chipped in to
pay the umpires' train fare from Boston, where the teams played yesterday
and will play tomorrow.

Reb Russell is in fine form, shutting out the Red Sox, 8-0, and beating
Carl Mays, handing the submariner his 2nd loss in the series. Eddie Collins
has two hits and 3 stolen bases to help the White Sox' 10-hit attack, while
Russell slams 2 doubles. His 2nd, misplayed by Ruth, drives in 3 runs in the
6th. The Babe recovers to throw out Rebel trying to stretch the hit into a
triple. Former Cub Wilbur Good, just signed, started in CF for the White Sox.

Sisler's triple and score on a wild throw by 2B Hank Shanks proves to be the
decisive run as the Browns top the Washington Senators, 4-3. Rasty Wright,
with relief from Byron Houck, earns the win over Hick Hovlik.

In an exhibition game in Connecticut, the Bridgeports top the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 2-1, in 10 innings. Carmen Hill takes the loss for the Bucs,
while Ferguson is the winner.

1919
Pirates manager Hugo Bezdek is found to have a heart murmur and he is sent
on vacation. Carey and Cutshaw will co-manage in his place.

1922
The AL announces plans to erect a $100,000 monument to baseball in East
Potomac Park, Washington. It never gets built.

The Yanks move back into first when Sad Sam Jones beats Ray Kolp, 7-3. Kolp
lasts just 2 innings before Bill Bayne takes over for the final 7 and allows
2 runs. Ken Williams hits his 23rd but Whitey Witt counters with a 3-run HR.

1924
The Yankees take a pair from the White Sox, winning the opener, 8-3 behind
Bush. They score 10 runs in the first inning in the nitecap, then hang on
for a 12-10 win. After the Yanks bat around, Babe Ruth greets reliever Mike
Cvengros with a 3-run HR, his 31st.

1925
Cincy's Dolf Luque tosses his 4th shutout of the year, topping the Phillies,
3-0.

In a Chicago sweep of the Senators, 10-5 and 6-2, White Sox Spencer Harris
hits his first ML HR, a grand slam off Washington's Curly Ogden. He'll hit
just 2 more homers in the majors, but he will end up as the career minor
league leader in runs, hits (3,617), doubles (743) and TB (5434). Incomplete
records give him the high in walks as well. Ted Lyons is the winner over
Walter Johnson in game 1 and Sarge Connally wins game 2.

1927
The Senators route the White Sox, 12-2, and give Johnson his 5th win of
the year. It is the 417th and last victory of his career, as the Senators
go with younger pitchers for the remainder of the season.

1928
The front-running Cardinals take 2 from Philadelphia, winning 7-6 and 12-2,
to move 4 1/2 games in front of Cincinnati. The Birds, now 62-35, are paced
by Chick Hafey's 4 doubles and 2 HRs, the first major leaguer to hit 6 long
hits in a DH.

1930
At the Polo Grounds, it again is Bill Terry leading the Giants to a 5-4 win,
this time over the last-place Phils. Terry has 4 hits, including two homers,
and his bases-loaded sac fly in the 9th drives home the winner. Jim Chaplin
is the winner over Earl Collard.

With the official temperature at 107 degrees in St. Louis, Ted Lyons and
the White Sox beat the Browns, 6-5. A run behind going into the 9th, the
Sox tie it on Bill Cissell's single and Bennie Tate's double, then score
the winner on Lyon's double. Goose Goslin hits his 22nd homer for St. Louis,
and his 4th in two days.

At Cleveland, the Indians also come from behind to win in the 9th, 7-6,
over the Tigers. Tiger pitcher Elon Hogsett breaks a 5-5 tie by hitting
a solo shot in the 9th, then gives up two runs on a double by Twitchie
Porter. Pete Jablonowski (after 1933, he plays as Pete Appleton) scores
the 7th run to pick up the win.

The Cubs sweep the Reds, 3-2 and 5-3, behind Charlie Root and Guy Bush. Benny
Frey and Jakie May take the losses. In game two, Hack Wilson drives home
Kiki Cuyler in the 4-run 3rd inning, but Charley Grimm gets credited on
the official scorecard with the RBI. This "lost RBI" would give Wilson
191 ribbies for the year, and will finally be corrected by ML baseball
in 1999. As James Braswell will first note in 1977, the lost ribbie gives
Wilson 11 straight games (July 24 - August 5) with at least one RBI, a ML
mark that Wilson will share with Mel Ott.

1931
The White Sox record an AL-record 12 hits in the 8th inning against the
Yankees. They score 11 runs in the frame, led by Bob Fothergill who homers
and triples, to win 14-12. Fats adds a pair of doubles for 4 long hits in
the game.

1932
The mighty Pirates sweep another pair from the Giants, winning 10-7 and
9-1. Pitt's Tony Piet has 2 hits in game 1 but then explodes with 7 RBIs
in 2 innings in the nitecap. Piet homers with 2 on in the 2nd inning,
then connects with the sacks full in the 3rd. He adds a pair of singles
and another run scored.

At Cleveland, Babe Ruth has 3 hits, including his 27th and 28th homers,
and drives in 7 tallies to personally account for the Yankees' 10-4 win
over the Tribe. Ruth is still suffering from an injured leg but is needed
today because Ben Chapman is ill. Ruffing fans 10 in the victory.

1934
The veteran Waite Hoyt stops Card Dizzy Dean's win streak at 10 with a 5-4
win in Pittsburgh.

Chuck Dressen, who will win pennants in Brooklyn and manage 16 seasons in
the ML, begins by replacing Bob O'Farrell at the helm for the Cincinnati Reds.

The Yankees' Jimmy DeShong allows just one hit - a homerun by Jimmie Foxx, his
34th of the year - in downing the Athletics, 2-1, and give the Yankees a split
with the A's. Philadelphia wins the opener over the Ruppert Riflemen, 4-3.

Schoolboy Rowe gives the visiting Tigers an 11-1 win over the White Sox. Rowe
scatters 3 hits in 9 innings.

1935
Chicago pitcher Ted Lyons ties a ML record with 2 doubles in the 2nd inning
while beating the Browns, 14-6, in game 1. The Sox tally 10 runs in the
2nd. In game 2, the Browns win, 4-3.

The Giants shut out the Dodgers twice today, winning 6-0 and 1-0. Carl
Hubbell defeats Dutch Leonard in game 1 and Clyde Castleman tops George
Earnshaw in the nitecap. Mel Ott's homer is the only score.

1936
In the 6th inning of a 16-6 Yankee win in Detroit, Tiger Goose Goslin drives
a ball in the gap in right center. Right fielder DiMaggio and CF Myril Hoag,
in for a slumping Powell, sprint for the ball and collide, the ball bounding
by for an inside-the-park homer. Both players are knocked unconscious but
appear unhurt ... Dimag stays in though Hoag is replaced. He'll play tomorrow
and collect a single, then collapse in his hotel room on the 30th with a
brain clot. Hoag will be operated on successfully at Harper Hospital and
will be out for the rest of the season, but he'll return to play six more
years. New York wins the game on 20 hits, scoring 4 runs in each of the
first two innings, and three apiece in the 4th and 5th. Lou Gehrig scores
5 runs and has two doubles, a single and homer number 31 with two aboard
to pace the visitors. Tommy Bridges is the loser while Johnny Murphy, who
relieves Monte Pearson in the 4th, is credited with the win. Selkirk adds
a homer for the Yankees, who have now hit 122.

Earl Averill raps his 18th and 19th homers of the year, off Earl Whitehill,
as Cleveland beats the Senators, 6-4. Lloyd Brown is the winner, allowing 11
hits. Hal Trosky extends his hitting streak to 22 games, while Cleveland's Roy
Weatherly sets an AL rookie record by hitting in his 20th consecutive game.

Dolph Camilli's 9th-inning homer, his second of the game, caps a 4-run
rally as the Phillies top the visiting Cubs, 5-3. Reliever Larry French,
who replaces Roy Henshaw in the 9th, loses after he gives up a single to
Johnny Moore off the RF wall to tie, K's Chuck Klein and serves up the
dinger to Dolph.

Bill Dietrich makes his 1st start for the White Sox since being picked up on
waivers and Chicago makes it easy with a 19-6 win over Philadelphia. Dietrich
helps with 4 singles.

1938
After taking the first 3 games in St. Louis, the Yankees are stopped by
Browns P Oral Hildebrand, who tops New York 4-3. All three Yankee scores
come on solo homeruns by DiMaggio, Selkirk and Gehrig. New York now leads

1940
King Kong Keller clouts 3 HRs and DiMaggio adds 2 HRs - each hitting
back-to-back homers twice - for the New York Yankees in a 10-9 win over
Chicago in the first game of a doubleheader. Webb is 5 for 6 with a homer
for the Sox. The Sox rebound for an 8-4 win in the nitecap.

1943
The Phillies threaten to strike rather than take the field for a game with
the Cardinals, the proceeds of which are earmarked for the War effort. The
players are upset because they learn about Harris' firing by reading about
it in the newspaper. Cox averts the strike by telling the players in the
locker room that the firing had "nothing to do with Bucky's abilities." The
Phils then agree to play, and snap the Cardinals' 11-game win streak. A
few days later, Cox and Harris get into a public name-calling fight, and
Harris deals the final blow by telling reporters that Cox bet on games,
a charge that will culminate in Cox being forced to sell the team.

In a charity game for the Red Cross at Yankee Stadium, Babe Ruth heads a team
of former Yankees against Ted Williams' team, which consists of the University

fireworks against the Indians. He singles in the tying run in the 15th and
then in the 16th hits a grand slam off reliever Bob Feller for an 8-4 Red
Sox win. The grand slam is the latest hit in a game in ML history. Mickey
McDermott pitches all 16 innings for the Sox, striking out 15 and walking
one. Vollmer has 13 homers, including 2 slams, in 24 games since July 4.

behind pitcher Billy Pierce. Al Smith, with a 2-run HR in the 8th, provides
the winning margin. The Sox will go 13-9 against the Yankees this year,
the first time since 1925 that Chicago is over .500 for the season against
the Bombers.

yesterday against Chicago, suffers a collapsed lung and is out for the rest
of the season.

tying a ML mark. The Reds lead 15-14 near the finish, but Dave Rosello's
RBI single off Jack Billingham wins the game. Going deep are Buckner (2),
Murcer, Mitterwald (2, including one in the 12th inning) and Morales for
