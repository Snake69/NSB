century before another Johnson breaks it, in 2001.

which players take batting practice and participate in a homerun derby.
On hand are 5,000 fans, each of whom paid $100 to attend.

1990
After having a commanding 9-0 lead and still ahead 10-3 entering the bottom
of the ninth inning, the Mets barely hold on to beat the Phillies at the Vet,
10-9. The nail biter causes the usually even mannered Bob Murphy to use a
mild obscenity in his call of the final out, "they win the damn thing by
a score of 10 to 9!".

For the 2nd time in his career, George Brett hits for the cycle, as Kansas
City beats Toronto, 6-1.

6-4, with a three-run homerun off Jim Deshaies at Philadephia's Veteran

outfielder, but only his first on the road.

Yankees 2B Randy Velarde strokes 5 hits in New York's 8-1 win over the
Royals. Velarde's hits include 4 singles and a HR.

Yankees on 4 hits at Yankee Stadium.

the Colorado shortstop goes deep in the seventh inning off Matt Morris to
complete the accomplishment.

The Padres top Houston, 6-5, as Mark Langston gets the win with 5+ innings
of work. Trevor Hoffman picks up his 41st consecutive save - 33rd this year
- tying a ML record. He'll blow his next save opportunity tomorrow in San
Diego's 5-4 win, ending his streak.

Former Yankee P Jim Bouton makes his 1st appearance at Yankee Stadium since
1970 at Oldtimers Day and is greeted with cheers all around. Bouton had
been persona non grata in New York since writing "Ball Four," which broke

and revealing players' extracurricular escapades. The Yanks invited the
Bulldog back after his son wrote a Father's Day article in the New York

who appeared in the most games of any Hall of Fame pitcher (1,071 games)
are inducted into the Hall of Fame. Long time Bay Area (A's and Giants)

Pimental to the Royals for P Elmer Dessens.

Jorge De La Rosa.

Ryan Madson ties a ML record with 4 wild pitches in the 4th inning. He
also hits two batters and allows 5 earned runs, though he doesn't figure
in the decision.

2010
The Angels acquire right-hander Dan Haren from the last-place Diamondbacks
in exchange for southpaws Joe Saunders and Patrick Corbin, RHP Rafael

miss the remainder of the season.

2011
Michael Cuddyer becomes the first Twins position player to pitch since
outfielder John Moses hurled against California in 1990. Moving from right
field to the mound in the eighth inning, the starting first baseman gives
up a double to Mike Napoli, a single to Mitch Moreland, and after Eric
Chavez grounds out, the right-hander walks Ian Kinsler to load the bases,
but then gets Elvis Andrus to fly out and David Murphy to pop-up for a
scoreless frame in the 20-6 loss in Texas.

With the bases loaded and two outs, rookie Jason Kipnis delivers his first
career hit giving the Indians a 3-2 walk-off ninth-inning victory over Los

three days ago.

With their 4-0 victory of Houston combined with St. Louis' 6-5 loss to

in sole possession of first place. This is the latest point in the season
