Ossee Schreckengost, 39, peripatetic catcher (7 teams) best known as battery

who is leading the AL in hitting, will go hitless tomorrow.

1929

10 ties the NL record. The Cards win 7-4 in 10 innings.

1930
Milt Gaston of the Red Sox beats the Senators to stop a 10-game winning
streak by the league-leading Senators beating the Nats, 5-1, in the nitecap
of 2. The Senators win the opener, 5-2. In 1929 he halted an 11-game string

and Earl Averill also homer.

1937
Joe DiMaggio is 5 for 5 and hits for the first of his two cycles (2nd in
1948) with 2 homers, triple, double and single to lead New York to a 16-2
win over the Senators. Gehrig also homers for New York. The game is marked
by a free-for-all between the two squads, and Joe Kuhel and Jake Powell are
ejected for fighting. The trouble between the 2 goes back to last week when
Powell knocked the ball out of Kuhel's glove. When Powell took his place
in LF after that incident he was showered with pop bottles.

PCL homerun champion Art Hunt marries Charlotte Axelson on the pitcher's
mound of Seattle's Civic Field. The ceremony is viewed by 9,272. The best
man is former big league pitcher Clarence Pickerel, who homers in the game

is walked down the aisle by Washington governor Clarence Martin and following
the ceremony the bride and groom walk under crossed bats held by both teams.

grounds into his ML-record 5th double play in two consecutive games. He
grounded into 3 in yesterday's nitecap.

Kirby Higbe beats the Bees, 3-1, on a 6-hitter to give the Phils their 1st
win after 11 straight losses.

1940
At Sportsman's Park, five National League hurlers combine to throw the

with the help of Max West's three-run homer.

1941

winning 1-0 and 9-0.

1945
With tomorrow's All-Star Game at Fenway Park canceled because of travel
restrictions, seven interleague games are played on July 9 and 10
for war charity during the schedule break. All the games are arranged
geographically. Plans for a USO-sponsored all-star game in Europe do
not materialize, although the war in Germany is over and fighting in the
Pacific will be over in 6 weeks. Today's games raise a total of $244,778
for charity. The Boston game, though it has the third-lowest attendance of
the games, contributes the most: $73,000. The reason: 44 box seats were sold
at the price of $1,000 each. The New York and Chicago games each net $50,000+.

At Comiskey Park, the White Sox edge the Cubs, 5-4, in ten innings, before
Chicago's biggest crowd (47,144) since 1941. At Cleveland, the Reds blank
the Indians, 6-0. At New York's Polo Grounds, Hershel Martin's grand slam
help the Yankees trounce the Giants, 7-1, in a rain-shortened game. At
Philadelphia, slugger Jimmie Foxx is the starting pitcher for the Phillies
(or Blue Jays) as they defeat the Athletics, 7-6.

At St. Louis, the Browns avenge their 1944 World Series loss to the
Cardinals with a 3-0 triumph. The Browns use nine different pitchers with
each hurling one inning, while the Cards have four pitchers work two innings
apiece. Despite the 11 pitching changes, the game takes only one hour 31
minutes to play!

At Fenway Park, the Red Sox top the Braves, 8-1, in the only day-game of
the series. Boo Ferriss discards plans to pitch both right and left-handed
in the game, and stays with his right in subduing the Braves. The Sox'
Jack Tobin singles off his brother, Jim, while Tommy Holmes has a hit for
the Braves. Holmes reaches the All-Star break with a .401 average and a
NL-record 37-game hitting streak, but the skein was snapped the day the
regular schedule resumes.

At Washington, the Senators defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-3, in a game marred
by the career-ending knee injury suffered by Brooklyn's rookie pitcher, Lee
Pfund. Ironically, the game's winning pitcher is Bert Shepard, who had lost
a leg in military service. Shepard pitches 4 innings and gives up two runs.

1946
With 7 Red Sox teammates on the AL squad, Ted Williams stages a power show
with 2 HRs, 2 singles, a walk, 4 runs scored, and a record 5 RBI to lead
the AL to a 12-0 laugher over the NL at Fenway Park (the most one-sided
game in All-Star history). The highlight of the All-Star Game is Williams'
3-run HR off a Rip Sewell blooper pitch in the 8th. The Red Sox came into
today's contest with a 7 1/2 game lead in the AL.

1948
At Boston, Johnny Sain becomes the NL's 1st 11-game winner, beating Robin
Roberts and the Phils, 13-2. Alvin Dark has 3 hits running his hit streak

up 2 runs in the 8th inning to Brooklyn, the first time in 29 games he has
failed to go the distance. Bob Miller relieves Roberts and picks up a win,
6-5, for the Phils. Roberts completed his last 8 starts in 1952 and his
first 20 in 1953. Reliever Jim Hughes is the loser.

1955
Chicago newspaperman Arch Ward, the originator of the All-Star Game, dies
at age 58 as he is leaving to cover his 22nd mid-season classic.

Giants P Jim Hearn does it all, hitting 2 HRs and a single, and drives in
4 runs in whipping the Dodgers 10-2 at the Polo Grounds. For Hearn, it is
his 3rd and 4th HRs of the year.

1956
The BBWAA, by a narrow margin of 14-12, vote to establish the Cy Young
Award to honor the major leagues' most outstanding pitcher. Commissioner
Ford Frick initiated the idea because he felt hurlers were not recognized
in the MVP voting, but ironically the first recipient of the Cy Young Award,
Dodger Don Newcombe, also won the Most Valuable Player Award.

1957
At Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the AL nips the NL 6-5 in the 24th
All-Star Game. Both teams score 3 in the 9th inning, but Minnie Minoso's
running catch with the bases loaded chokes off the NL's last-half rally.

1958
In front of the Subcommittee on Anti-Trust and Monopoly, U.S. Senators are
treated to a long (45 minutes), rambling, barely comprehensible discourse
on baseball and America by New York Yankees manager Casey Stengel. When
Stengel finishes, the Senators ask Mickey Mantle about his feelings, and
the Yankee centerfielder deadpans, "My views are just about the same as
Casey's." The manager and player return to New York in time to help thrash
the Cleveland Indians, 13-2.

1959
ML baseball announces that the 1960 season will open one week later than

of the year as the Phils top the Cards, 11-0, at home.

loss drops the Braves from 1st place to 3rd, as Brooklyn takes over 2nd place.

The Red Sox club the Yankees, 14-3, before 30,253, the largest crowd at
Fenway so far this year. Frank Sullivan is the winner. Wertz, Williams and

1960
Jim Coates suffers his first loss after 9 straight wins, and 14 straight
over two seasons, as the Red Sox beat the Yankees 6-5. The Sox are lead by

ML record is 17-2.

1961
Sherm Lollar's 9th-inning pinch-hit grand slam, off Frank Funk, for the
White Sox crushes Cleveland 7-5. It is the 5th pinch slam in the AL this
season - two by the Sox - and ties the ML record. The Sox also win a 2nd
game, 9-8. Over the afternoon 8 HRs are hit.

The Tigers take over 1st place with a doubleheader sweep of the Angels. Frank
Lary's 13th victory in the opener, a 1-0 three-hitter, is followed by Jim
Bunning's 6-3 win in the nitecap.

request a reduced schedule for the 1963 season. They also vote unanimously
to continue playing 2 All-Star Games each year.

1963
The Indians hosts their third Mid-Summer Classic in front of a disappointing
crowd of 44,160 fans at Cleveland Stadium. The 5-3 loss to the National
League does not feature any players from the Tribe.

Willie Mays is held to a single, but dominates a 5-3 NL win in the All-Star
Game. He also walks, steals twice, scores twice, bats in a pair and makes a
great catch. It is Stan Musial's 24th All-Star appearance, a record. Musial's
teammates comprise the starting infield for the NL:  1B Bill White, 2B
Julian Javier, SS Dick Groat and 3B Ken Boyer. Javier was chosen as the
replacement for Pittsburgh's injured 2B Bill Mazeroski. During Musial's
career in All-Star games he had a .317 batting average (20 for 63) and an
All-Star Game record of six homeruns.

1965
Senators LF Frank Howard ties a ML record with 7 strikeouts in Washington's
twin-bill split with the Red Sox.

In the bottom of the 9th inning, Willie Stargell breaks a 1-1 tie by
slamming a Jim Maloney pitch over the RF roof at Forbes Field. The Bucs
top the Reds, 2-1.

1968
Appropriately, pitching dominates the All-Star Game. Willie Mays, playing
in place of injured Pete Rose, tallies an unearned run in the first
inning against AL starter Luis Tiant to complete the scoring for the day -
the first All-Star effort to end 1-0. Don Drysdale, Juan Marichal, Steve
Carlton, Tom Seaver, Ron Reed and Jerry Koosman hold the AL to 3 hits.
This is the first All-Star game played indoors (Astrodome).

1969
With one out in the 9th, Chicago's Jimmy Qualls bloops a single to left-CF,
the only blemish on Tom Seaver's 4-0 near-perfect win before a record crowd
(59,083) at Shea Stadium.

With the Twins hosting Kansas City, the Royals' Bob Oliver attempts to steal
2B with Ellie Rodriguez at-bat. Catcher John Roseboro pushes Rodriguez' bat
out of the way and his throw to 2B nails Oliver. After huddling 8 minutes
with his umpire crew, home plate ump John Rice declares Rodriguez out for
interference and orders Oliver back to 1B, though (as author Rich Marazzi
points out) the rule states that an out nullifies an interference call. The
Royals win, 4-3. Killebrew accounts for all the Twins' scoring with a homer.

President Nixon watches the Senators for the 4th time this season, and they
finally win one for him, beating the Indians, 3-0, behind Joe Coleman's
4-hitter.

1970
At Tiger Stadium against his former team, Dalton Jones of the Tigers loses a
grand slam against the Red Sox when he passes teammate Don Wert on the base
paths. Jones pinch hits for Jim Price and belts a 2-2 pitch from Vincente
Romo into the RF upper deck for a grand slam. However, he passes Don Wert
between first and second and is called out, ending up with a 3-RBI single.

In Atlanta, Chief-No-ka-homa is joined by his cousin Chief Round-the-Horn,
but the duo fails to inspire the Braves, 7-6 losers to the Giants. Bernie
Carbo's 8th inning HR breaks a 6-6 tie.

1971
Royals Fred Patek hits for the cycle off of Jim Perry. The 5'5" Kansas City
shortstop's efforts help defeat the Twins, 6-3.

The A's beat the Angels 1-0 in the longest shutout in AL history - 20
innings. Vida Blue strikes out 17 batters in the first 11 innings for the
A's, while the Angels Billy Cowan ties a ML record by fanning 6 times. Both
teams combine for 43 strikeouts, a new ML record for incompetence.

Braves SS Leo Foster makes a memorable debut. Against the Pirates, he errs
on his first chance, hits into a double play in the 5th, and a triple play
in the 7th. Pittsburgh rolls by Atlanta, 11-2.

In the Royals, 6-3 win over the Twins, Freddie Patek hits for the cycle.

1972
The Angels' Nolan Ryan strikes out 16 batters, including an AL-record 8 in
a row and three on 9 pitches in the 2nd inning, as he stops the Red Sox
on one hit. Yastrzemski's one-out single in the 1st is only hit ... Ryan
then racks up his 8 K's and retires the last 26 consecutive batters. Sonny
Siebert loses the 3-0 battle. For Ryan, he is the 3rd pitcher to twice fan
the side on 9 pitches. The Angels fireballer, who first did it with the Mets
in 1968, joins Lefty Grove (twice in 1938) and Sandy Koufax (1962 and 1964)
as the other hurlers who have accomplished the feat.

The Twins lose to the Yankees, 9-6, despite Rich Reese's pinch grand slam. For
Reese, it is his 3rd pinch grand slam, tying Ron Northey's ML record.

1973
In a record-setting walkathon between the Reds and Expos, 25 base on
balls are handed out as Montreal strolls to an 11-6 win. Well off the AL's
two-team mark of 30, this tops the NL record of 23, last reached on July 7,
1911. Six Montreal pitchers walk 16, one short of the record for an NL team,
while Reds pitchers Clay Carroll and Tom Hall walk 9. Hal King pinch hits
a grand slam for the Reds in the 6th inning, his 2nd pinch dinger in 9 days.

1976
In Montreal, the Astros Larry Dierker no-hits the Expos 6-0 and evens
his record at 8-8. The future team broadcaster and manager had previously
thrown 2 one-hitters. Dierker strikes out 8, including the 1st 2 in the
9th. Houston is 4th in the West while Montreal is last in the East.

Before 53,328 in Cincinnati, the Pirates score 2 runs in the 10th on a Richie
Zisk homer and take an 11-9 lead, only to lose to the Reds, 12-11. George

April 16th.

1979
The fans elect three Red Sox to start in the AL outfield for the All-Star
game:  Yaz, Rice and Lynn.

1985
Catcher Buck Martinez makes two outs on the same play. In the bottom of the
third inning in a game between the Blue Jays and the Mariners, Phil Bradley is
on second with one out when Gorman Thomas singles to right. Jesse Barfield's
throw home to Buck Martinez nails Bradley, though Martinez breaks his ankle
in the collision. When Thomas tries to take 3B on the play, Martinez' throw
sails into LF. Thomas tries to score but George Bell's throw to Martinez
beats him. Buck makes the catch and tag while sitting on the ground. Whitt
takes over catching and the Jays win in 13 innings, 9-4. The big blow is a
grand slam homer by George Bell in the 13th - the first extra inning slam
in club history - to break a 4-4 tie and give Toronto a 9-4 win.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

who joins his 5th club in the last 3 seasons.

1986

ending his consecutive-game streak at 740. Murphy hadn't missed a game
since September of 1981.

The Padres trade P Tim Stoddard to the Yankees for P Ed Whitson, who had
become the target of such fan abuse in New York that manager Lou Piniella
would no longer pitch him in Yankee Stadium.

1987
Mike Schmidt hits his 513th career homerun off Atlanta's Zane Smith to move
past Eddie Mathews and Ernie Banks into 10th place on the all-time list,

1988
Chris Speier hits for the cycle and Ernest Riles hits the 10,000th homerun
in Giants history to lead San Francisco to a 21-2 rout of the Cardinals. The
21 runs are a San Francisco record. Speier also cycled as an Expo in 1978,
just the 4th major leaguer to do so for two teams. He joins Joe Cronin
(Washington, 1929; Red Sox, 1940), Babe Herman (Dodgers, 1931; Cubs, 1933)
and Bob Watson (Astros, 1977; Boston, 1979).

Nolan Ryan wins his 100th game as an Astro, 6-3, over the Mets, and becomes
the 7th pitcher in ML history to win 100 for 2 different clubs. Ryan won
138 games for the Angels in the 1970s.

1991
Cal Ripken Jr's 3-run HR lifts the AL to a 4-2 win over the NL in the
annual All-Star Game. Andre Dawson homers for the NLers who lose for the 4th
straight year. Ripken, who also won the pre-All-Star Game Home Run Derby,
is named the game's MVP. Tony LaRussa becomes the first manager with three
straight All-Star victories.

Valentine on an interim basis.

1993
By homering twice in Montreal's 6-1 win over San Diego, Expo OF Moises

1994
