1901
At Detroit, Bill "Doc" Nance has 6 hits - 5 singles and a double - off 4
Cleveland pitchers to pace Detroit to a 19-12 win. Giving up the hits are
Gus Weyhing (soon on his way to the Reds), Pete Dowling, manager Jimmy
McAleer in his only pitching appearance (0.1 IP, 2 H, 3 BB) and 3B Bill
Bradley in his only pitching appearance (1 IP, 4 H).

1904

rolls past the Highlanders, 16-3. For the second time in his career, Bill
Bradley scores 5 runs.

1905
The Philadelphia A's "sell" catcher Mike "Doc" Powers to the New York
Highlanders. Powers will be sold back to the A's on August 7. As noted by
Lyle Spatz, Powers was needed to replace back up C Red Kleinow, injured
yesterday in a game with Detroit. Powers will catch tomorrow but play mainly
at 1B, replacing Hal Chase whose nose was broken in the Detroit game. The
New York Times (July 22) will note that New York needed Powers to replace

1907
The Reds manage 11 hits off Christy Mathewson, but no runs, and the Giants
win 4-0.

1908
New York sweeps the Pirates, beating Lefty Leifeld, 7-0, on a 3-hitter by

by Wagner, Chief Wilson and Alan Storke - but to no avail. McGinnity wins
the nitecap with relief help from Hooks Wiltse.

1909
At Nicollet Park in Minneapolis, Irv Young puts on "the greatest single-day
mound performance in the history of the Millers" (historian Stew Thornley). In
the first game of a doubleheader with the Milwaukee Brewers (AA), Young
holds the Brewers to 4 hits to win, 1-0. Young homers in the fifth for
the game's only run. So impressive is Young that he pitches the nightcap,
holding the Brewers hitless until the 9th and finishing with a one-hit
5-0 victory. The double shutout puts the Millers two games in front of
Milwaukee. The 2 teams will fight for the AA lead for the next 2 months,
before fading in the final week, allowing Louisville to sneak into first.

1911
In the 9th against the A's, Cobb breaks a 7-7 tie by scoring from first on
a Jim Delahanty's single. Cobb runs through coach Hughie Jennings' frantic
signal to hold up and using a fadeaway slide eludes the tag of catcher Ira
Thomas. Detroit wins 8-7 to stay in first place.

The Giants get inside-the-park homers from their first two batters, Josh
Devore and Larry Doyle, to take a 2-0 lead over the Pirates. Chief Meyers
also hits an IPHR in the 4-run 5th, when McGraw is ejected for arguing when
Merkle is called out at 3B trying to steal. New York wins, 9-4.

1912

July 28th in Montreal, the first ML game to ever be played in Canada.

The Tigers edge the Senators, 1-0, scoring their only run in the first on
Harry Heilmann's Texas Leaguer. The loss is starter Harry Harper's first
following 7 straight wins. Ty Cobb announces that he will join the military
after the season. The statement by the AL's leading hitter comes after he
and his family drop in at the White House following the game.

The Reds sweep two from the Dodgers, winning 3-1 and 4-2. Heinie Groh, the
NL's leading hitter (.355 through July 11 to runner-up Benny Kauff's .324)
is 4 for 8 in the 2 games.

1916
Detroit's Bill James strikes out 7 straight batters in the Tigers' 3-1 win
over Washington.

1919
In Chicago, the Red Sox lead 4-0 over the first-place White Sox when C
Wally Schang's throw to 2nd hits P Carl Mays in the head. Mays quits the
mound after 2 innings at Chicago, blaming his teammates for lack of support
afield, and refuses to come back and pitch. Reliever George Dumont comes in
and is roughed up for 7 runs as Chicago wins 14-9. Afterwards, Mays deserts
the team and takes the train to Boston. The Sox will put Mays on the block
prompting a showdown between dissident owners and AL President Ban Johnson.

Cleveland infielder Ray Chapman returns to the lineup after a month's
absence due to lumbago, a rheumatism in his lower back. He has a single
in 3 at-bats as the Indians top Washington, 5-4. In Chapman's absence the

and an assist. The Phils' Casey Stengel will match the mark on July 30th.

1921
Jim Thorpe hits 3 homeruns for Toledo (AA) as the Mud Hens defeat Milwaukee,
17-4.

1922
Cardinal P Bill Doak misses a no-hitter when he neglects to cover 1B on an
infield single by Phillie OF Curt Walker in the 7th. Jack Fournier, playing
1B, fields the ball but Doak fails to cover the bag. Doak still wins the game
1-0. This is the 2nd time Doak has lost a no-hitter by failing to cover 1B,
and his 2nd one-hitter this year. Rookie John Singleton is the loser.

At Chicago, Heinie Groh of the Giants gets a three-run homer when the ball
rolls under the fence. But the Cubs win, 5-4, in 12 innings.

The Boston Red Sox defeat the St Louis Browns, 2-0, in front of only 68
spectators, which is the smallest crowd in the history of Fenway Park.

1923
In Philadelphia, the Reds score in bunches to beat the Phils, 21-7. Cincy
scores 5 in the 1st, 5 in the 3rd, 4 in the 5th, one in the 6th and 6 in
the 9th.

1926
Brooklyn 1B Jack Fournier subs for Babe Herman, the rookie who took his job,
and makes the most of it, banging 5 hits and 3 homers - the first Brooklyn
player to hit 3 roundtrippers in a game. Jack also totals 5 RBIs, but it is
not enough as the Cardinals win, 12-10, in St. Louis. Cards Taylor Douthit
reaches 1B twice in the 5th inning and each time steals 2B.

1925
In Boston, RF Elmer Smith pulls off an unassisted DP to help the Reds beat
the Braves, 4-1. With the runner on 1B, Dave Harris, running with the pitch,
Smith snags Jess Barnes short fly and easily beats Harris to the bag for
the DP. It is the 4th time in Smith's career he's had an unassisted DP;
only Tris Speaker has more.

1927
Ruth is 4 for 4 to lead New York to a 5-3 victory over the Indians. Babe
comments after the game, "Three singles and a double and they call that a
perfect day. That's just bunting." Willis Hudlin takes the loss, the 8th
in a row for the Tribe.

Before the game in Chicago, admirers present Eddie Collins, now with the
A's, with a new automobile. The A's then bunch hits in 3 innings to defeat
Ted Lyons, 7-5. Mickey Cochrane leads the attack with 4 hits.

The Tigers sweep two from the Senators, 7-3 and 13-9. Sam Gibson wins the
opener, despite walking 12 batters before being lifted in the 9th. Harry

straight 4 for 4 day. Bing Miller also collects 4 hits and winning pitcher
Milt Gaston adds 2 doubles and a single.

1930
Detroit's Vic Sorrell stops the Senators, 5-4, to drop Washington out of
first place. Sorrell's single off Bobby Burke drives home Mark Koenig with
the winning run. Every batter in Detroit's lineup collects a hit, as the
Tigers amass eleven safeties.

The defending champs, the Philadelphia A's, move into first place by again
beating the Browns, 12-1, and will remain in the lead the rest of the season.

With a little help from the Massachusetts Sunday baseball law, the Braves
sweep a pair from the Cubs. Socks Seybold scatters 7 hits in the opener
to beat Sheriff Blake, 2-1. In the nitecap, the Braves are ahead, 3-0,
at the end of eight innings with the clock at 5:34 PM. The Cubs then score
4 in the 9th to take the lead, 4-3. The Braves have runners on 2B and 3B
with one out in the bottom of the 9th when the police inform the umpire
that the game must stop because it is 6 PM. The score reverts to 3-0 and
Bob Smith has a win. Guy Bush is the loser.

The Robins stay 2 1/2 games ahead of the Cubs, despite losing to Pittsburgh,
1-0. Larry French scatters 9 hits, and the Robins strand 12 runners,
to hand a tough loss to Jumbo Elliot. Paul Waner's 7th inning ground out
scores Joe Engle from 3B with the lone run.

streak continues.

12 innings.

1934
Babe Ruth hits his 700th HR, a two-run shot in the 3rd off Timmy Bridges on
3-2 pitch, to lead the Yankees to a 4-2 win at Detroit's Navin Field. As he
is circling the bases, Ruth shouts to his teammates, "I want that ball." As
with his 500th and 600th homers, the Babe pays $20 to a youngster for the
ball. The victory puts New York back in first place. Lou Gehrig singles in
his first at-bat and then has a lumbago seizure and has to be helped off
the field. Jack Saltgaver takes his place. Red Ruffing scatters six hits
for the win.

With the Cubs losing to the Braves, 7-6, the Giants' 7-6 victory over
Pittsburgh puts them two games ahead of Chicago in the NL. Joe Moore's two
homers, single and double pace New York. Fitzsimmons wins his 12th.

and winning, 7-3. Ferrell hits a pair of homers good for 4 runs.

1935

to Boston.

1936
Bill Lee wins a 1-0 duel from Carl Hubbell, who allows just two hits, as the

1937
Before 12,249 in St. Louis, the first-place Yankees and Browns slugged it
out, New York taking the opener, 16-9, while the nitecap is called after 11
innings with the score tied, 8-8. The Yankees collect 20 hits in the opener,
while the Browns add 14. DiMaggio contributes 3 homers in the nightcap,

a doubleheader. Ted Lyons wins the opener, 5-0, and Jack Knott ties up the
Red Sox in the nitecap, 7-0.

It's lucky 13 for Bobo Newsom as the Detroit ace wins his 13th straight. Bobo

a point of 1st place.

The Cardinals edge the visiting Giants in a brace of games, 7-6 and
4-3. Johnny Mize hits for the cycle in the opener for the Birds.

1941
In Chicago, the Yankees sweep two, winning 8-1 and 1-0 in 11 innings, to
run their win streak to 14. Joe DiMaggio continues his streak with three

Derringer with 2 runs in the 9th to win, 6-5.

Former ML player Eddie Mayo, playing for Los Angeles (Pacific Coast
League), is accused of spitting in the face of umpire Ray Snyder during an
argument. PCL President W. C. Tuttle suspends Mayo for one year. Mayo protests
that he never spat and, after a series of hearings with minor-league czar
Judge Brabham, he will be reinstated on September 5 and finish the season
with the Angels. Burleigh Grimes, managing Grand Rapids in the Michigan
State League last year, was banned for a year for a similar offense.

1943
The AL edges the NL, 5-3, at Shibe Park in the first All-Star Game played
under the lights. Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox is the hitting hero with a
3-run HR off Mort Cooper in the 2nd inning. Cooper loses his 2nd straight
All-Star game, the only pitcher to ever do so. Vince DiMaggio of the Pirates
has a single, a triple and a HR in 3 trips. Doerr also handles 6 fielding
chances. At the All-Star break he had handled 307 errorless chances, dating
back to May 20th. His AL streak will end at 349 chances, a record he will
break in 1948.

1944
A .300 hitter as a rookie for the Tigers in 1943, Dick Wakefield finishes
Navy air training and then is released from the service pending assignment. He
rejoins the Tigers and will hit .355 the rest of the season, pushing Detroit

first week after the All-Star Game, Wakefield homers twice, and goes 9 for 24.

1945
At Yankee Stadium, Cleveland outfielder Pat Seerey slugs three HRs, the 2nd
a grand slam, and a triple for 15 bases total as the Indians go on a batting
spree to win, 16-4. Seerey hits his homers off starter Atley Donald, Monk
Dubiel and Steve Roser. Fat Pat will top his total in 1948, the only player
to ever have two games with 15 or more total bases. Heath adds a pair of
homers and pitcher Steve Gromek collects 4 hits to win his 10th game and 4th
straight over New York. The Yanks' Donald is going in the other direction,
and this will be his last career start. His hex over the Indians is broken as
well; after going 13-1 against Cleveland, he's lost to them twice in 10 days.

The Philadelphia Phillies are skippered by two managers as they beat the
Pirates, 11-9. With Fat Freddie Fitzsimmons managing, the game was started
on June 3, but suspended after 6 innings because of Pennsylvania's Blue
Law. The Phils were in the lead, 11-9. Under the leadership of Ben Chapman,
who took over for Fitzsimmons on June 29, Andy Karl shuts out the Pirates
today for the last 3 innings and the Phils win, 11-9. For Karl it is one
of his 15 saves on the year, high in the NL. In later years, most record
books will credit the win to manager Fitzsimmons, though Neft & Cohen will
give it to Chapman.

1946
Al Zarilla of the St. Louis Browns legs out 2 triples, tying the ML record,
in the 4th inning as the Browns beat the A's, 11-4, at Shibe Park. Zarilla's

1947
Making his 14th ML uniform switch, Bobo Newsom joins the Yanks. His 7-5

season Newsom will join the Giants. To make room for Newsom, the Yanks sell
P Mel Queen to the Pirates.

1948
Vic Raschi of the Yankees drives in the winning runs with a bases-loaded
single in the 4th inning and is the winning pitcher (pitching 3 scoreless
innings) as the AL again tops the NL, 5-2, in the All-Star Game at Sportsman's
Park. Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, George Kell and Hal Newhouser miss places
in the lineup due to injuries. The AL wins for the 11th time in the last
15 All-Star contests.

1950
Doctors remove 7 bone fragments from Ted Williams' elbow in a 75-minute
operation. He will be sidelined until mid-September. But he will go on to

including .388 and .328 to lead the AL in 1957 and 1958 respectively.

1951

innings for Boston, as Chicago wins this marathon, 5-4. Clyde Vollmer hits
a homer and two singles for the Bosox. Third baseman Vern Stephens plays
the entire game (18 1/3 innings) without a putout. Boston scores twice
in the top of the 19th, but the White Sox strike back with three runs,
two on a pinch single by Ed Stewart. For the second night in a row, the
two teams set a record for the longest night game and the 36 innings in
two successive games establishes an AL mark.

Chuck Dressen is quoted in the Washington Post as saying his Dodgers are
"the greatest in team history" and better than the '41 team. Da Bums prove
it today with 8 runs in the 1st two innings against Chicago enroute to
an 8-6 win. Chicago has 5 homers, 2 by Ransom Jackson. Brooklyn gets a
leadoff homer - his 2nd in two days - by Carl Furillo on the first pitch,
and a first inning homer from Dick Williams, his ML first.

Both Wes Westrum and Davey Williams of the Giants hit grand slams, as the

1954
In the All-Star Game, the AL breaks the NL's 4-game winning streak with an
11-9 win. Larry Doby's pinch HR in the 8th, followed by Nellie Fox' 2-run
single, ends the highest scoring All-Star Game in history. The 2 teams
combine for 31 hits, with the AL amassing 17. The Indians' Al Rosen has 2
HRs and 5 RBIs; a homer by Ray Boone follows his 3rd inning homer. Cincy
stars Ted Kluszewski and Gus Bell also hit homers for the NL. Dean Stone
is the winner, despite throwing just 2 pitches and retiring no batters. He
relieves Bob Keegan in the 8th, with Red Schoendienst on third and Alvin
Dark on first. With a 1-1 count on Snider, Schoendienst tries to steal
home and Dean's throw is in time to get Red. Schoendienst argues it's a
balk. The AL scores 3 runs in the bottom of the inning and Virgil Trucks
throws a scoreless 9th to make Stone a cold winner. Gene Conley is the loser.

Bob Purkey (14-3).

1963

1976
The NL emerges victorious in the annual All-Star Game by a score of 7-1
at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium. George Foster, one of 7 Reds position
players on the squad, homers, drives in 3 runs, and is named the game's
MVP. Rookie Mark Fidrych gives up 2 runs and takes the loss. It is the NL's
13th win in the last 14 games.

1977
With New York third baseman Lenny Randle at the plate in the sixth
inning, Shea Stadium goes dark when the Big Apple suddenly experiences a
blackout. Before the game against the Cubs is suspended due to the power
shortage, the Mets players drive their cars onto the field and amuse
the crowd by performing a variety of antics in front of the headlights.

1978
Nolan Ryan of the California Angels and Steve Renko of the Boston Red Sox
take no-hitters into the ninth inning of their respective games before both

1979
California's Nolan Ryan and Boston's Steve Renko (with one-out help from Bill
Campbell) each lose no-hitters in the 9th inning, and each settle for one-hit
victories:  6-1 over New York and 2-0 over Oakland respectively. Rickey
Henderson has the one-out hit off Renko while Reggie Jackson has the one-out
hit off Ryan. The Yanks score in the 8th after Spencer hits a line drive that
is called an error by scorer Dick Miller. Rick Miller misses a shoestring
catch on the ball. LP Tiant had a one hitter in his last outing on July 8.

1982
In the first All-Star game played outside the United States, the National
League cruises to its 11th straight win beating the American League at
Montreal's Olympic Stadium, 4-1. Dave Concepcion's second-inning two-run
homer off Red Sox starter Dennis Eckersley is the turning point of the
game. The NL has now won 19 of the last 20 contests.

1984
The Yankees retire Roger Maris' (#9) and Elston Howard's (#32) uniform
numbers. The team also erects plaques in their honor to pay tribute to
their achievements as Bronx Bombers.

At Minnesota, Detroit tops the Twins, 5-3, when Lou Whitaker bloops an
inside-the-park homer to win it. Detroit sends it to extra innings when RF
Kirk Gibson throws out Tim Teufel at home with two out in the 9th. Willie
Hernandez (5-0) is the winner.

1985
The Angels get three pinch hits in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Blue
Jays, 4-3. Miller, Brown and Boone all deliver singles to give Witt the
CG win.

The White Sox take a 9-0 lead over the Orioles and hang on for a 10-8

Herm Winningham and Randy St. Claire.

1991
At Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, the Orioles defeat the A's 2-0 on a
combined no-hitter by pitchers Bob Milacki, Mike Flanagan, Mark Williamson
and Gregg Olson. It is only the second time in history that 4 pitchers have
combined to throw a no-hitter. On September 28, 1975, Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott,
Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers turned the trick for Oakland against the
California Angels. Starter Bob Milacki is lifted in the 6th after Willie
Wilson smashes a ball off the pitcher's index finger. The other 3 pitchers
throw 1 inning each.

The only rainout in Astrodome history is caused by major flooding in
Houston. The seven inches of rain prevents players and no more than 20 fans
from getting to the ball park.

1993
In a game which will be best remembered for John Kruk's non at-bat against
fireballer Randy Johnson, the AL All-Stars beat the NL rivals at Baltimore's
Camden Yards, 9-3. As the Phillies' first baseman flails at the Big Unit's
fastballs in a comical manner, Kirby Puckett's double and homerun earns
the Twins outfielder the Midsummer Classic's MVP Award.

Players Association chief Donald Fehr says that if serious negotiations
between the players and the owners don't begin soon, the players could go
out on strike in September, threatening the postseason.

A class action suit by two season ticket holders against the Padres is
settled out of court. The suit argued that a preseason form letter from
Padres president Dick Freeman stated that the team would be contenders
because of its group of young stars, which the Padres then traded away. The
Padres agreed to loosen their refund policy and the plaintiffs withdraw their
demand that the team not trade Fred McGriff. McGriff goes within the week.

1995

without issuing a walk is ended when he gives up a free pass to opposing
pitcher Joey Hamilton, a career .041 hitter.

The Blue Jays top the Mariners, 4-1, behind a solid 8 innings from David
Cone, who allows a solo HR by Jay Buhner. The score might've been higher

9th by Angel Martinez and turns it into a 1-6-3 triple play.

1996
The Indians score 4 runs in the 4th, 5 runs in the 5th and 6 runs in the
6th as they defeat the Twins, 19-11. The Tribe counts 12 doubles and 3 HRs
among its 22 hits. The 12 doubles ties an AL record set in 1990, and the
two teams combine for 18 doubles, a new AL record (the NL mark is 23). OF

6 runs for Minnesota.

the Tigers, 10-5.

win. The Giants win, 7-0.

1997
Casey Candaele flies out to left field in his last major league at-bat ending
his nine-year career with the Expos, Astros and Indians with a .250 batting
average. The utilityman is outhit by his mom, Helen Callaghan, a former
star in the All-American Girls Baseball League, who finished her big league
career with a .257 lifetime average playing in Minneapolis and Fort Wayne.

Dennis Reyes, the first lefty in nearly five years to start a game for the
Dodgers, throws 6 strong innings in beating the Giants, 9-3. The last lefty
starter for L.A. was Bob Ojeda, on September 24th, 1992, in a no-decision
at Cincinnati.

The Marlins use an 8-run 4th inning to wallop the Phillies, 9-3. Gary
Sheffield is the main man with two homers in the inning, hitting a solo
shot and a 3-run homer, before leaving with a pulled hamstring.

The Cardinals shrug off pinch homers by Hernandez and Orie to down the host
Cubs, 11-5. The Cardinals swat 20 hits, including 4 homers.

With the temperature at 100 degrees, Pedro Martinez fires a one-hit shutout
to beat the Reds, 2-0. The Expos ace gives up a single to Bret Boone in
the 5th for the only hit. Mike Lansing triples twice for the Expos before
leaving in the 5th inning with exhaustion.

Seattle and Texas combine for a record 31 strikeouts in the Rangers' 4-2
victory. Randy Johnson racks up 14 K's in 7 innings, and reliever Bobby
Ayala adds 4, but gives up 2 runs in the 9th. The previous mark was 30 set
by the Mariners and Athletics on April 30, 1986.

1999
In the 70th Midsummer Classic, the AL defeats the NL, 4-1, at Fenway Park
in Boston. Red Sox P Pedro Martinez is named the game's MVP as he strikes
out the 1st 4 hitters to bat against him, and 5 of the 6 he faces in his 2
innings of work. The two All-Star pitching squads combine for a record 22
strikeouts. The game begins 15 minutes late as Hall of Fame OF Ted Williams
rides out in a cart for the first-pitch ceremony. Players from both teams
surround the former Red Sox star in a spontaneous display of homage.

2000
The Dodgers edge the Angels, 4-3, in 10 innings but not before California
executes an unusual play. After the Dodgers' Adrian Beltre triples off
the newly-renovated RF fence in the bottom of the 10th, the Angels move LF
Darin Erstad to the infield to try to prevent the run from scoring. Erstad,
playing at about 2B, throws out Kevin Elster for an OF assist. Jim Leyritz
then singles in the run.

2001
Pittsburgh P Todd Ritchie has a no-hitter against the Royals, until Luis

perfect innings at the Astrodome in 1986, the 41-year-old Roger Clemens
gives up six runs in the first inning in the 75th Midsummer Classic played
at Houston's Minute Maid Park. MVP Alfonso Soriano and Manny Ramirez both
hit homers in the first inning. The eventual 9-4 American League victory
is halted in the top of the fifth inning as the much chagrined 'Rocket'

the Rockies for OF Preston Wilson and cash.

2006
The Reds and Nationals complete a controversial (to Reds fans) eight-player
trade that sends OF Austin Kearns, SS Felipe Lopez and P Ryan Wagner
to Washington in exchange for Ps Gary Majewski, Bill Bray and Daryl
Thompson, SS Royce Clayton and INF Brendan Harris. It will be revealed that
Majewski had taken a cortisone shot days before the trade and had been on
anti-inflammatories since March. The Reds will feel that the Nationals GM
Jim Bowden, formerly with the Reds, withheld information, which the Nats
deny. Majewski will struggle before going on the DL on August 7.

skipper of the 26-61 club.

At Busch Stadium, Prince Fielder outslugs Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz in
the final round, 6-5, to win the All-Star Home Run Derby. The Brewer first
baseman's power surge includes a stunning shot estimated to have traveled
over 500 feet.

2010
The National League wins its first All-Star Game since 1996, beating their AL
rivals at Angels Stadium, 3-1. Braves catcher Brian McCann, the Mid-summer
Classic's MVP, hits a three-run double with two outs in the seventh inning
to break the Senior Circuit's 14-year drought.

2012
Zack Greinke becomes the first pitcher to start three consecutive games in
the same season since Red Faber turned the hat trick with the White Sox
in 1917. The Brewers' right-hander, who was the starting pitcher in the
team's final game before the All-Star break because he was ejected from
the previous contest the day before for arguing a close call at first base
after throwing just four pitches, makes it three straight starts when he
takes the mound to begin the second half of the season for the Brew Crew.

2013
Giants' right-hander Tim Lincecum hurls the 15th no-hitter in franchise
history, the seventh since the team shifted to San Francisco in 1958, when
he blanks the Padres, 9-0, in front of a very enthusiastic crowd at Petco
Park. The 'Freak' threw 148 pitches enroute to his historic performance,
the second-most ever needed to accomplish the task.
