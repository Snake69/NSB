1902
Bid McPhee is released as Reds manager and is replaced by interim manager
Frank Bancroft.

In a 6-3 win against the Giants, the Pirates' Lefty Davis, 26, in stealing
second "broke his leg in the same manner Van Haltren did two months ago on
the same spot," according to The Sporting Life. Davis, a .287 hitter with 45
steals in 171 big league games so far, is out for the season. He'll return,
but bat only .234 with 20 thefts in 177 more games.

1903
In Cincinnati, the 2nd place Giants edge the Reds, 8-6, although the Reds pile
on McGinnity for five runs in the 7th. Mathewson then relieves and a pickoff
by C Jack Warner of a napping Harry Steinfeldt at 3B prevents further scoring.

At Boston, Jimmy Collins collects 5 hits, including a triple and a homer,
to pace the Americans to a 8-5 win over Chicago. It is Boston's 45th win
of the year.

1904
The Highlanders salvage the last game of the series with the Americans,
10-1, but Boston leaves New York with a 2 1/2 game lead in the AL. Patsy
Dougherty has 4 of New York's 17 hits.

1908
The White Sox play their 2nd 16-inning game in 2 days, beating Philadelphia,
5-4.

Vic Willis gives the Pirates their 2nd win in a row over the Giants, winning,
6-2. Mike Donlin's triple is the only New York hit.

1910
The Phillies' George McQuillan coasts to an easy 18-0 laugher over the
Pirates. Kitty Bransfield makes it easy with 8 RBIs, to set a 20th century
ML record, topped in 1911. It is still a club record, though tied, for
largest margin in a shutout. Lefty Leifield takes the loss.

1911
The Federal Express of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, carrying
the St. Louis Cardinals to Boston, plunges down an 18-foot embankment outside
Bridgeport, CT, killing 14 passengers. The team's Pullmans were originally
just behind the baggage coaches near the front. When noise prevented the
players from sleeping, manager Bresnahan requested the car be changed. The
day coach that replaced the players' car was crushed and splintered. The
players help remove bodies and rescue the injured, then board a special
train to Boston, where the day's game is postponed. The railroad pays each
player $25 for his rescue work and for lost belongings.

1914
Babe Ruth breaks in with Boston, striking out in his first at-bat, but gets
a win in a 4-3 victory over Cleveland. With the score 3-3 in the 7th, Duffy
Lewis pinch hits for Ruth, singles, and later scores the winning run. Dutch
Leonard strikes out 4 of the 6 batters he faces in relief.

At St. Louis, the Browns win the 1st of 2 with the A's, 4-3, as Tilly
Walker hits a pair of homeruns. The A's win game 2, 6-4, with the help of
a triple steal. Walks to Strunk, Barry and Amherst College pitcher Chick
Davies, who is making his ML debut, load the bases in the 8th and set up
the triple steal. Davies also has two hits and a complete game victory in
his only appearance this year.

The Giants outhit the Cardinals, 18-16, and win 13-9 in St. Louis. Mathewson
goes all the way in the win, walking none but allowing 3 homeruns. Bill
Steele takes the Redbird defeat.

Only 26 people are on hand to see Newark (IL) fade, 2-0, at Baltimore.

1916
The Red Sox sweep the White Sox, winning 5-3 and 3-1. Babe Ruth starts
both games, lasting a third of an inning in the opener, but pitching a
3-1 complete-game win in the nitecap. Ruth started the opener to give Rube
Foster more time to warm up, and left after retiring the first batter.

The Robins turn a 4-3 deficit into a 5-4 win over the Cardinals when Casey
Stengel hits a 2-run homer in the 7th.

1917
In Detroit, Boston's Babe Ruth tops the Tigers, 1-0, allowing just Donie
Bush's scratch single in the 8th. Ruth deflects the ball but the throw
by the shortstop is too late. Ruth has a single and triple, but a pinch
triple by Chick Shorten in the 9th drives home the only run. Ruth strikes
out Veach, Crawford and Cobb in the 9th. For the last he shakes off catcher
and player/manager Carrigan. In early 1942, in a speech in Los Angeles, Ruth
will call this game his greatest thrill. (The Babe also relates to writer
John Carmichael that his greatest game was the called shot in the WS of 1932.)

1918
Cubs pitcher Phil Douglas picks up two wins over the Braves today, relieving
in the 9th of the opener and beating Art Nehf, 4-3, in 10 innings. Shufflin'
Phil starts the nitecap and tops veteran Pat Ragan, 3-2.

At Washington, the Tigers overcome a 6-run deficit to beat Walter Johnson,
8-6. Detroit scores 5 runs in the 7th and 3 in the 9th for the win. Cobb
is 2 for 3 with a sac fly and 2 runs scored.

The first-place Red Sox top Chicago, 4-0, with Carl Mays outpitching Ed
Cicotte. Cicotte gives up 9 hits, including 3 opposite field doubles to
Babe Ruth. Playing 1B, the Babe records 20 putouts.

1919
At Boston, Cincinnati defeats the Braves, 4-2, in 13 innings when Heinie
Groh belts a 2-run homer. The Reds start the scoring in the first inning
when Bill Rariden bounces a hit through an opening in the scoreboard for
a homerun. The boy operating the scoreboard neglects to close one of the
openings for the innings' scores and it was through this that the Reds
catcher lines his only homer of the year. (As noted by historian Rich
Marazzi) The rules will later be changed so that it would only qualify as
a double. The Reds also win game 2, 6-2.

1920
Guy Morton provides the Indians with another starter when he wins his second
straight game, a 4-0 win over the Senators.

With the Reds and Braves tied at 3-3 in Cincinnati, Jake Daubert hits
a 2-out 3-run homer in the bottom of the 9th to win it for the Reds,
6-3. Daubert's homer is the first to take advantage of the new rule giving a
batter a walkoff homerun instead of crediting him with the number of bases
(in his case, a double) needed to score the winning run (as noted by David
Vincent). Daubert's hit is a bounce homer.

1921
At Chicago, Dickie Kerr gives up a pair of 2-run homers to Meusel and Ruth
in losing to the Yankees' Collins, 4-0. For Ruth it is his 32nd homer of
the season and he has now homered in every AL park this year. Later at
Comiskey Park, robbers blow off the door of the safe and make off with
$3,000, mostly receipts from the game. Tomorrow, the New York Times says,
"Owner Charles Comiskey denied reports that the safe contained papers
pertaining to the former White Sox players now on trial."

1922
In the first of 4 games at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees edge the first-place
Browns, 2-1, as the Browns hand New York two "home runs." Aaron Ward hits
a liner that bounces off the glove of a leaping Ken Williams and goes into
the LF stands for a homerun. In the 6th Tobin makes 2 errors on one play as
he drops a Babe Ruth fly ball near the RF foul line allowing Babe to take
second. Babe continues to 3B and a surprised Tobin then bounces his throw
into the stands behind third allowing Ruth to score the tie breaker. Urban
Shocker is the loser as the Browns lead is cut to a half game.

1923
Harry Frazee, owner of the Red Sox since 1916, sells out for over $1 million
to a group of Ohio businessmen, who bring in veteran front office man Bob
Quinn from St. Louis to run the club. Frazee's departure is welcomed by Boston
fans who are fed up with the sale of Frazee's best players over the years.

1924
Cubs 1B Lee Cotter equals a ML record when he makes 21 putouts and one
assist in a game against Brooklyn, but Chicago loses, 9-1.

1925
George Sisler drives in 7 runs in 2 innings, tripling with the bases full
in the 3rd and hitting a grand slam in the 4th, in a Browns' 10-5 win
over Washington. Sisler sets the AL record with his 2 hits in consecutive
innings. Nats reliever Spencer Pumpelly gives up a homer to the first ML
batter he faces.

Twenty Red Sox batters go to the plate in the 4th and 5th against Cleveland,
scoring 5 runs each inning. Boston wins, 14-7.

1927
The White Sox tie a ML record with 8 sacrifices, all bunts, against the Red
Sox, and win 7-6. The White Sox win it in the 9th on daring base running
by Bill Barrett. After stroking a 2-out single, Barrett steals 2B, and when
Fred Hofmann's throw is wide, Bill reaches 3B, and continues home when Ira
Flagstead fumbles the ball in CF.

Fellas, this is how you do it. The Senators make it 6 straight wins over
the Indians when manager Bucky Harris swipes home with two outs in the 10th,
and the Senators win, 3-2. With Harris on 3B, and Tris Speaker on 1st, Tris
takes off for 2B. On the throw down, Harris steals home. Firpo Marberry
picks up the win in relief.

Pete Alexander allows just 4 hits in beating the Phils, 7-0. No Phillie
runner goes past 1B. The Cards make 15 hits against Hub Pruett, while
Frankie Frisch swipes 2 bases to run his total to 25, the NL high.

Ty Cobb and Al Simmons each have three hits to lead the A's to a 7-6 win
over the Browns. One of Cobb's safeties is a 2-run homer.

The Yankees beat Detroit, 8-5, as Lou Gehrig busts his 29th homer of the year,
tying him with Ruth for the lead. Waite Hoyt picks up the win over Lil Stoner.

1929
Down 6-4 to Detroit after 5 innings, the Red Sox plate 10 runs in the 6th
inning to win 15-8. The Tigers stanch the scoring in the 7th with a triple
play. Hot-hitting Marty McManus has 5 hits, including 2 homers, for Detroit.

In a PCL game at Oaks Park, Oakland's Roy Carlisle takes SF's Curt Davis
downtown with a homerun that lands on top of a house 618 feet away, one of
the longest documented homers ever.

1931
At the Baker Bowl, the Giants bang out 28 hits in beating the Phils 23-5
in the opener of a doubleheader. Twenty two of the hits come off reliever
Dutch Schesler, a Phils record, but he does not get the loss. Freddy Leach,
with 5 hits and a homer, and Bill Terry, Mel Ott and Sam Leslie bang one
apiece as the Giants pile on with seven doubles. Nine players have 2 or more
hits. Spitballer Clarence Mitchell is the beneficiary. Despite another Ott
homer in the nitecap, the Phils come back to win, 6-5.

1932
Back in Philadelphia, Cleveland sweeps a pair from the tired A's, winning
9-8 and 12-7. Erl Averill is 6 for 10 in the 2 games, with 3 homers.

1933
Dizzy Dean whips New York, 2-1, as the Giants' losing streak reaches 7
games. Following the game, the Giants receive a telegram from Blondy Ryan,
the Giants' injured SS, that states "They cannot beat us. Am enroute." The
telegram will remain posted on the team bulletin board for the remainder
of the season.

1935
At Washington, the Tigers take 10 innings to beat the Senators,
7-6. Detroit leadoff hitter Pete Fox has his hitting streak stopped after
29 games. Gehringer has a homer and a triple and Goose Goslin has 3 hits
including a homer for the winners.

1936
The Giants lose 5-4 in Pittsburgh as Carl Hubbell, in relief, walks in the
winning run. The loss leaves New York eleven games behind the front-running
Cubs. New York wins the 2nd game, 14-4, as Bill Terry, hobbled with a knee
injury, bangs out a single, double and triple. The win sparks a Giants'
surge that will see them win 39 of their next 47 games.

1937
Peaches Davis and Al Hollingsworth each pitch shutouts over the Cardinals as
the Reds win, 6-0 and 7-0. Davis allows 9 hits in the opener and Hollingsworth
surrenders 6. St. Louis had not been shut out before today.

Feller allows just 2 hits, but 6 walks and a wild pitch gives the Tigers
a 3-2 win over the Indians. Hal Trosky and Moose Solters hit HRs off Boots
Poffenberger for the Tribe.

The Bees' Lou Fette edges the Phils' Sy Johnson, 1-0, in a 13-inning game.

win over the Cards.

The Dodgers buy former ML hurler Whitlow Wyatt from Milwaukee (American
Association).

1939
With another Yankee-dominated lineup, the AL defeats the NL 3-1 in the 7th
All-Star Game, at Yankee Stadium. Joe DiMaggio excites the partisan crowd
with a 5th-inning homer. Cincinnati OF Ival Goodman fractures his shoulder
diving for a ball. Yankees drive in all the AL runs. Indians fireballer
Bob Feller steals the show at Yankee Stadium as the 20-year-old hurls 3 2/3
scoreless innings. This is the first of three times that the All-Star game
is held at Yankee Stadium.

Archie Templeton of the Albuquerque Cardinals (AZ-Texas League) strikes out
19 El Paso batters but fails to get credit as he is lifted in the 8th. A
steal of home by El Paso's Mel Berman ties the score in the 9th and when
an argument ensues over the pitch, umpire Jack Rice is forced to call in
the police as he tosses 3 Cardinals. Albuquerque wins in the 10th, 8-5.

1941
Lefty Grove allows just 6 hits in 8 innings, but the Tigers beat the Red
Sox veteran, 2-0.

1944
At Forbes Field, Phil Cavarretta of the Cubs sets an All-Star Game record
by reaching base 5 successive times on a triple, single and 3 walks as
the NL romps, 7-1. Ken Raffensberger is the winner over Tex Hughson, who
gives up four runs in the 5th. The AL manages just six hits - all singles -
and five come off Bucky Walters in the first three innings.

At Albany, the Philadelphia A's top the Albany club, 13-5, in a rain
delayed game that finally starts at 9:50 p.m. Because of the rain, the
entire infield is covered with sawdust to soak up the water. Connie Mack
is given a pen and pencil set by the Elks before the game.

The major leagues approve an unlimited number of night games for any clubs,
with the exception of Sunday when they need the approval of the visiting
club. Only Washington, at present, plays all its weekday games under
the lights.

1945
Aaron Robinson, Yankees C, returns from the military. Red Ruffing is back
too, and so are Hugh Mulcahy and Buddy Lewis. Charlie Keller will follow,
and a couple of dozen former ML players will be in uniform before the season
is over.

1946
The Giants jump on newly activated pitcher Johnny Grodzicki and the
oft-injured Howie Krist to beat the host Cardinals, 13-3. Grodzicki was
the Cards' best minor league hurler in 1941, winning 31 games for Houston
(Texas League), but was severely injured by shrapnel in WW2 and never
regained his effectiveness.

The Yankees sell INF Oscar Grimes to the A's. Grimes was New York's regular
3B in 1944-45, but lost his job when the vets returned.

1948
The Reds' Ken Raffensberger allows just one hit - a single by Marty Marion
in the 4th - in shutting out the Cardinals, 1-0, in St. Louis. It's his
2nd one-hitter against St. Louis this year.

1950
The Midsummer Classic returns to Comiskey Park, the site of the first game,
and is won by the National League, 4-3. Making a leaping, off-the-wall
catch of a Ralph Kiner drive in the first inning, Ted Williams fractures
his left elbow. Remaining in the game, he puts the AL ahead, 3-2, with a
RBI single. Kiner's 9th-inning HR ties the game, and Red Schoendienst's
blast in the 14th wins it. Williams later states he was never the same
after this injury. It's a game of firsts - first extra-inning All-Star game,
first time the NL wins at an AL park and the first All-Star game ever shown
on national television.

1952
CF Richie Ashburn picks up 3 assists throwing out Cardinal runners at the
plate, as the Phils win 4-3. The loss stops the Cards' win streak of ten
games. Robin Roberts scatters 14 hits - 4 by Hemus and 3 each by the 2
Rices - to win.

1953
In his 2nd ML start, Al Worthington shuts out Brooklyn, 6-0, for his 2nd
shutout. Worthington stops the Dodgers' consecutive-game HR streak. With the
two whitewashes in the first two games, Al ties a ML record, last accomplished
by Boo Ferriss of the Red Sox in 1945. It is the first time this century it's
been done in the NL, but Karl Spooner of the Dodgers will match it next year.

1954
Phillies rookie Jim Command's first major league hit is a grand slam off
Brooklyn's Carl Erskine. The 25-year-old third baseman's blow in the six-run
eighth isn't enough as Brooklyn hangs on to win the Ebbets Field contest,
8-7. It is Command's only ML HR. Brooklyn counters with 2 homers by Gil
Hodges and one by Carl Furillo. Herm Wehmeier, with help from Robin Roberts,
wins the nitecap, 3-1.

In the opener of a doubleheader, Giants OF Don Mueller hits for the cycle,
getting his hits off 4 different pitchers in a 13-7 rout of the Pirates. Five
other HRs are added, 3 in the 3rd as Monte Irvin, Whitey Lockman and Alvin
Dark connect.

The Red Sox whip the lowly Athletics, 18-0, for one of the worst shutouts in
AL history. Frank Sullivan is the victor over Bob Trice. In the nitecap, the
Sox lighten up to win, 11-1. Not a good day as A's slugger Gus Zernial breaks
his collarbone diving for a ball and is out of the lineup until late August.

1956
The White Sox purchase Cardinal relief P Ellis Kinder.

1957
In Pittsburgh, Braves IF Felix Mantilla and OF Billy Bruton collide while
chasing a pop fly. Mantilla will miss 19 games while Bruton will suffer
knee damage and be out almost a year. Logan replaces Mantilla and knocks
in 3 runs in Milwaukee's 7-2 win.

At Kansas City, Mantle scores the tying run in the 9th, then wins it in the
11th with an opposite field homer off righty Tom Morgan. Mantle now has 23
homers, and is hitting .370 for the first-place Yanks. Chicago trails by 3 1/2
games. The Yankees will lose tomorrow, 4-2, with Mantle hitting another homer.

In a 5-4 Dodger win at Ebbets Field, a brawl takes place in the 7th when Jim
Gilliam is decked by a pitch from Reds pitcher Raul Sanchez. The 2 start
trading punches and when Reds 3B Don Hoak rushes over, he is felled by
Brooklyn's Charlie Neal. The 4 get tossed and Acker, who replaces Sanchez,
then walks Roseboro, batting for Gilliam. Snider follows with his 2nd
homer of the game. With Gilliam out of the game, Gil Hodges plays 2B for
the first time in 13 years.

Red Sox lefty Mel Parnell retires on the day he becomes a 10-year man.

1958
In New York, Mantle and Larry Doby both propel shots in the 500-foot range
to the RF upper deck, as New York tops Cleveland 11-3.

1959
Boston SS Don Buddin cracks a 10th-inning grand slam, off reliever Bob Turley,
to give the Red Sox an 8-4 win over New York. Turley replaced Bronstad,
who took over when Ryne Duren and Yogi Berra are tossed by ump Summers.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1960
One-hit shutout pitching by Bob Friend and HRs by Ernie Banks and Del
Crandall pace the NL to a 5-4 win over the AL at Kansas City's Municipal
Stadium in the first of 2 All-Star Games. Friend has notched 2 of the NL's
last 3 All-Star wins.

1961
In the first of two All-Star games played this season, the NL beats
the American League, 5-4, before a capacity crowd on a very windy day
at Candlestick Park. The contest features a record seven errors and the
memorable sight of a 165-pound pitcher Stu Miller balking after being blown
off the mound by a gust of wind in the 9th inning, a fact the right-hander
says has been exaggerated over the years. The balk enables the AL to forge
a 3-3 tie before losing in the 10th inning.

1963
Jim Maloney strikes out 13 in pitching the Reds to a 7-3 second-game win
over the visiting Cubs. In the opener, the Cubs win 7-0, scoring 7 runs in
the 11th inning.

1964

on ump Jim Honochick after a close play during a doubleheader loss to the
White Sox, 7-4 and 6-1, the previous day.

At Anaheim Stadium, Tony Perez' homer off Catfish Hunter in the 15th inning
gives the Senior Circuit a 2-1 All-Star victory over the AL. It is the
longest Midsummer Classic contest ever played.

1968
In Kansas City, ground is broken for the $43 million Harry S. Truman Sports
Complex which will include separate side-by-side stadiums built specifically
for baseball and football. Arrowhead Stadium, home of the NFL's Chiefs,
will open in 1972 followed by the debut a year later of Royals Stadium, the
new home ballpark of the American League's franchise in the City of Fountains.

Earl Weaver, who never played in the majors, replaces Hank Bauer as manager
of the Orioles. The O's will win 11 of the first 15 games under Weaver.

Minnesota rookie Rick Renick is the 16th AL player to hit a HR in his first
ML at-bat. The Twins beat the Tigers, 5-4.

Chicago Cubs P Bill Hands strikes out for the 14th straight at-bat in the
2-0 Cubs win in the nightcap at New York. The 14 strikeouts in consecutive
at-bats (as opposed to plate appearances) are a ML record.

1969
The Red Sox swat the Orioles twice, winning 7-4 and 12-3. Reggie Smith is
7 for 9 and stretches his hit streak to 19 games. Yastrzemski has a homer
in each game as the Red Sox total 22 hits in the nitecap, including 5 by
Mike Andrews. Boston's outfield has 12 hits in game 2 to match the AL record.

Harmon Killebrew hits a pair of homers and a double to boost his RBI total
to an AL-high 90. The Twins beat the Pilots, 9-2.

4th 1-0 loss this year.

1971
Tony Conigliaro, who had gone 0 for 8 with 5 strikeouts for the Angels
during their 20-inning loss 2 days earlier, calls a 5 A.M. press conference
to announce his retirement. Later tests will show that the sight in his
left eye, injured in a 1967 beaning, has deteriorated.

Deron Johnson hits 3 HRs, giving him 4 straight over 2 games, helping the
Phils beat the Expos 11-5.

The Reds win game 1 against the Mets, 5-2, then complete the sweep as Tony
Perez drives in all 5 runs to defeat the Mets, 5-3. Perez puts the Reds
ahead with a 3-run homer off Tom Seaver in the 8th. Jim McGlothlin strikes
out 12 in the game-2 win.

1972
Cub Billy Williams goes 8 for 8 in a doubleheader split with the Astros. The
Astros win the opener, 6-5, and the Cubs take the nightcap, 9-5. Williams
is 5 for 5 in the 2nd game to raise his average to .328. He'll go 3 for 5
and 4 for 5 in his next two games as he will go on a 22 for 38 tear.

At Oakland, Boston's Marty Pattin has his no-hit bid foiled when Reggie
Jackson hits a one-out single in the 9th. Boston wins, 4-0.

1973

the Rangers, 14-2. The 3 for 4 performance by the Tiger's leadoff hitter
helps him record the 500th run and RBI of his career.

Jim Northrup, batting leadoff for Detroit, drives in 8 runs in a 14-2 win
over Texas.

in ML baseball, playing for the A's.

1976
Hank Aaron's 10th-inning homer, his 9th, in game 2 gives the Brewers

Bill Castro.

In a pre-game promotion at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, 34 couples
are married at home plate. The nuptials are then followed by Championship

At Fenway, the Red Sox win over the Twins, 6-4, when the Twins CF drops a
long fly ball for a double after a bucket of popcorn falls in his eyes.

1977

MVP in All-Star history. Vida Blue starts for the NL, the first pitcher to
start for both leagues. Blue also started in 1971 and 1975 for the AL.

1980
The Dodgers sell knuckleballer Charlie Hough to the Rangers for an undisclosed
sum. Hough played every year of the 70's with the Dodgers, and will play every
year of the 80's with the Rangers. He is the only player in history to play
back to back decades with two teams. The 32-year-old knuckleballer will spend
11 seasons with Texas posting a 139-123 record along with an ERA of 3.68.

1982
As noted by Floyd Connor and John Snyder, the Cincinnati Enquirer features a

and Fred Patek.

1994
Handling four chances in the 8-1 defeat to the Rockies, Cardinal infielder
