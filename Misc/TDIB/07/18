4th-place Sox.

1908
The Cubs win by a run, beating the Giants, 5-4, behind Orval Overall. Hooks

ML record won't be topped until Bill Fischer, in 1962.

In Detroit, Boston pitcher Smoky Joe Wood slips and breaks his thumb while
fielding a grounder off the bat of Bobby Veach. Except for one inning of

will enter the service and die of influenza in November.

1919
In a Friday game in Cleveland, the Indians' one-eyed starter Hi Jasper
gives up an early 2-run homer to Boston's Babe Ruth, but leaves the game
in the 8th with the score tied 3-3. Joe Harris then cracks a pinch triple
to drive home 3 runs as the Tribe takes a 7-3 lead. When the Sox score a
run and Elmer Myers loads the bases on walks, manager Lee Fohl signals for
another reliever. Tribe CF Speaker protests that it should be a righty,
but Fohl goes with lefthander Fritz Coumbe, who had not pitched since May,
to pitch to Ruth. The Babe pounds a high curve for a grand slam - his 3rd
of the year - and an 8-7 Boston win. After the game, owner Jim Dunn fires
Fohl replacing him with Tris Speaker, who will stay on for 7 years. The
first thing Speaker does is ticket Coumbe to the minors.

and has to be carried from the field. The Senators' Al Schacht is the easy
winner. Three Senators - Rice, Harris and Gharrity - each make three hits
and score twice. Rice swipes another base on his way to a league high 63
... he'll also lead the AL in being caught with 30.

1921
At Navin Field in Detroit, Babe Ruth becomes the all-time homerun leader
when he hits his 139th career blast as a major leaguer. The Yankee slugger's

18 years in the National League.

The Black Sox trial begins in Chicago.

1923
In a 4-1 win at Detroit, Yankee RF Elmer Smith snags a hit-and-run line drive
by Del Pratt and jogs to 1B to get Harry Heilmann, who had been running. The
unassisted DP by an outfielder is the only one in Yankee history, but
for Smith it is his 3rd, putting him behind Tris Speaker on the all-time
list. He'll add a 4th in 1925 when patrolling the outfield for the Reds.

Cleveland's Guy Morton allows 2 hits in beating Washington, 4-1.

1925

At the Polo Grounds, 18-year-old Mel Ott hits his first ML homer in a
6-4 10-inning win over the Cubs. Ott hits a line drive on which CF Hack
Wilson attempts a shoe string catch. The ball bounds all the way to the CF
club house and Ott easily circles the bases. He's the youngest player in
the 20 century to hit an inside-the-park homer ... Pat Callahan, in 1884,
was not 18 when he hit his. Ott will hit one more IPHR in his career, in
1929. Freddie Fitzsimmons gets the decision over Charlie Root, dropping
the Cubs into 2nd place.

In the second game of a DH in Philadelphia, the Phillies use four pitchers
as pinch hitters and pinch runners against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jack

1928
Ruth delivers his 36th homer, off Ted Lyons with 2 on and 2 out in the 9th

closes the scoring with another single.

The first-place Robins drop a 6-2 decision to Sheriff Blake and the visiting
Cubs. Del Bissonette's 6th-inning homer accounts for all the Robins scoring,

lead to 17 percentage points.

At the Baker Bowl, the Reds top the Phils, 13-6, as Bob Meusel scores 5 runs.

leading average at .390.

league-leading 24th.

In a twinbill at St. Louis, the A's lose 2B Wayne Ambler who fractures

exhibition game. The Browns win 10-6, then lose 7-6.

1939
The Dodgers acquire infielder Pee Wee Reese from the Red Sox in exchange for
a player to be named later (Red Evans), three minor leaguers and $35000. The

inning, to lead the Chicago White Sox to a 12-11 victory over the Athletics
in Philadelphia. Seerey is the 5th ML player to accomplish the feat and
is the only player in ML history to twice reach 15 or more total bases
in a game, having totaled 15 bases in 1945. Three of the homers are in
successive innings, just the 3rd to do that. Fat Pat's first shot is over
the LF bleacher roof off Carl Scheib, the next two - off Scheib and Bob
Savage - are on the roof, and the last, off Lou Brissie, into the upper LF
stands. Brissie, the 5th pitcher, is the loser against Howie Judson. The A's

Seerey will become the first player to strike out 7 times in a doubleheader.

The NL awards a forfeit victory over the Cards to the Phils for a stall that
follows a brawl featuring Phils manager Terry Moore and 1B Earl Torgeson,
and Cards C Sal Yvars. The Cardinals are under the impression that local
ordinances prevent lights from being turned on to continue a game. Down 8-1
in the 5th inning of game 2, St. Louis begins stalling by changing pitchers
twice in the inning. Stanky calls for a 3rd pitcher and Ump Babe Pinelli
calls the forfeit. Phils P Greenwood loses his first ML win and will not
notch his first victory - his only one - till July 31. Cards manager Stanky
gets slapped with a five-day suspension and a fine, while Yvars and Torgeson
each get a two-day suspension. Game 1 is a 10-inning Phillies victory, 11-10.

New York.

Dodger slugger Gil Hodges hits his 12th career grand slam to tie the NL

others. O's catchers Ginsberg and Triandos will set the modern ML record
for passed balls this season with 49.

1972
San Diego's Steve Arlin takes a no-hitter against Philadelphia into the
9th inning before settling for a 2nd straight 2-hitter. The first hit comes
when Denny Doyle hits a 2-out bloop single over the head of 3B Dave Roberts,
playing in for a possible bunt. The Philadelphia second baseman advances to
second on a balk by the right-hander and scoring on Tim Hutton's single,
but the 26-year-old gets Greg Luzinski to fly out to center, preserving
the Padres' 5-1 victory at Jack Murphy Stadium. During the season, Arlin

yet compile a 10-21 record.

just the 6th player to accomplish this feat. Owner Tom Yawkey calls it the
longest shot he's ever seen at Fenway. The others:  Detroit's Hank Greenberg,
May 22, 1937; Boston's Jimmie Foxx, August 12, 1937; Yankees Bill Skowron,
April 20, 1957; Boston's Carl Yastrzemski, May 16, 1970; and Brewers Bob

10th with a game-ending homer. It is Boston's Dave Stapleton's turn today as
he homers off Minnesota's Roger Erickson to give starter Mike Torrez the win.

1983
Despite being in first place in the NL East (at 43-42), the Phillies
fire manager Pat Corrales because the team is "not playing up to its
potential." GM Paul Owens will manage the club instead, and will go 47-30
to win the pennant. Managing his first game, the Phils drop a 9-2 decision
as the Astros shell Steve Carlton. It's his 11th loss of the year and drops
the Phils into a tie for 2nd place with the Pirates.

At Toronto, George Brett is robbed of an apparent triple by his teammate
Mike Armstrong. Brett hits a liner down the RF line that Armstrong, sitting
in the bullpen, thinks is foul and retrieves. Ump Bill Kunkel decides to
send U.L. Washington, who scored on the play, back the 3B, and Brett is
sent to 2B. Brett has a homer off Jim Clancy but KC eventually loses, 8-2.

1986
The Royals announce that 50-year-old manager Dick Howser, who led the club
to a World Championship last season, will miss the rest of the season to

will attempt a comeback during spring training, will lose his courageous
battle against cancer in June.

tomorrow when he goes 2 for 4 but no homers.

1988
In 2 1/3 innings, Mariners hurler Gene Walter balks four times in a 12-3
loss to Detroit. The southpaw becomes the third American League pitcher to
tie the major league record this season.

Seattle's Gene Walter balks 4 times in 2 1/3 innings in a 12-3 loss to
Detroit. He is the 3rd AL pitcher to tie the ML record this season.

1989
Donnie Moore, 36, shoots himself to death at his home in Anaheim, CA after
shooting and critically wounding his estranged wife Tonya. Friends said
Moore was haunted by the 2-run homerun he surrendered to Dave Henderson in
game 5 of the 1986 ALCS, costing the Angels a trip to the World Series,
and that he had been even more depressed since his release last month by
minor league Omaha.

The Dodgers trade P Tim Leary and SS Mariano Duncan to the Reds for OF Kal
Daniels and IF Lenny Harris.

1990
A day after setting a ML record for triple plays, the Twins and Red Sox set
one for DPs. The Red Sox hit into 6 double plays, while the Twins ground
into 4 to set the ML record, as the Red Sox win again, 5-4. The previous
mark of 9 DPs in regulation was last accomplished on May 1, 1966 by Boston
and California.

Arbitrator George Nicolau rules in favor of the players association saying
that the 26 ML owners colluded and were aware of a databank that detailed
1987 salary offers. In September he will decide the damage amounted to
$102.5 million.

1993
Atlanta's Steve Avery and 2 relievers shut out the Pirates, 2-0, despite

The Major League Baseball Players Association rejects the owners' salary
cap proposal as baseball moves a step closer to a strike.

1995
Lee Smith becomes the third hurler in major league history to give up
two game-ending grand slams in the same season when Albert Belle goes
yard giving the Indians a dramatic 7-5 victory over the Angels at Jacobs
Field. At the end of last month, the 37-year-old closer yielded a walk-off
four-run round-tripper to A's slugger Mark McGwire.

The White Sox blast Yankee P Jack McDowell for 13 hits and 9 runs in 4 2/3
innings in their 11-4 win in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. McDowell makes
an obscene gesture to the fans as he is booed walking off the field.

The Marlins score a wild 12-10 14-inning victory over the Giants. Florida is
led by 1B Greg Colbrunn, who drives in 7 runs on 2 HRs, offsetting a pair of
homers by Barry Bonds. Colbrun hits a grand slam in the 5-run 14th inning,
while Glenallen Hill hits a 3-run homer in the same frame.

Dave Andrews, public address announcer for the Abilene Prairie Dogs of the
Texas-Louisiana League, is ejected from a game after Abilene manager Charlie

but is still fined $50.

1997
The Mariners, seeking pitching help, trade Scott Sanders (3-6) and two minor
leaguers (pitcher Dean Crow and 3B Carlos Villalobos) to the Detroit Tigers on
Friday for righthanders Omar Olivares (5-6) and Felipe Lira (5-7). Piniella
practically begged for a trade after the M's lost to Minnesota 9-7 in 12
innings, cutting Seattle's lead over Anaheim in the AL West to one-half game.

1998
The late Ted Kluszewski, a four-time All-Star and a member of the Reds
Hall of Fame since 1962, has his #18 retired by the club. The left-handed
slugger's nine-foot replica jersey, unlike the others on the Cinergy Field
wall, is depicted sleeveless because the first baseman would need to cut
off the sleeves to make his massive upper arms fit into tight flannel shirts
the team wore.

The Red Sox set an AL record by hitting 4 two-out homers in one inning
as they beat host Detroit, 9-4. They hit the 4 dingers in the 7-run 4th
inning. Mo Vaughn, Donnie Sadler, Darren Lewis and Nomar Garciaparra all
homer in the stanza.

1999
On Yogi Berra Day at Yankee Stadium, David Cone becomes the 16th pitcher

Rockies, 3-2. A's vet Tim Raines is 0 for 1 before leaving the game for the
hospital because of dizziness. He first felt a pain 2 days ago and tests
will show he has Lupus. Raines will sit out a year and make a remarkable
comeback in 2001 with the Expos.

2000
Hitting four doubles in a game, which has only occurred 37 times in the
last century, is accomplished twice today. In a 12-4 drubbing of the Cubs,
Royals lead-off hitter Johnny Damon (5 hits total) accomplishes the rare feat
as does Shannon Stewart of the Blue Jays in an 11-7 loss to the Mets at the
Skydome. It is Stewart's second game this year with four extra base hits, also
tying a ML record. Mets C Mike Piazza hits his 3rd grand slam of the season.

The Tigers purchase vet 1B Hal Morris from the Reds.

2001
The game between the Diamondbacks and Padres is halted at the end of the

at Comerica Park.

A train carrying toxic substances derails in Baltimore, causing the

the Rangers. Texas takes the first game, 6-4, behind Frank Catalanatto's
4 for 4, battering Sean Douglass (0-1) in his ML debut.

Perez ejected for arguing a call. It is his 1st ejection in 31 seasons and
more than 3,800 games as a player and manager.

Houston batters St. Louis, 17-11, as 3B Jeff Bagwell hits for the cycle. He
is the 212th major-league player since 1901 to cycle, 106 in the NL. The
Cardinals score 6 runs in the 5th inning, but the Astros answer with 8 in
their next at-bat. Batting notables include Moises Alou, who has a 3-run HR
to stretch his hit streak to 23 games, and Bobby Bonilla, with his 2,000th
career hit. McGwire, with his 564th, and Pujols also homer for the Birds.

Jeremy Giambi is 4 for 4 with 6 RBIs to lead the A's to a 7-2 win over the
Twins. It is their 15th win in 19 games.

2005

to put an end to his 29-game hitting streak, the longest in the majors this
season. Only three Sox have reached 30 consecutive games. The Sox lose
2B Mark Bellhorn to a thumb injury and will initially put him on the DL,
then cut him. Bellhorn is hitting .216 with 109 strikeouts in 283 AB.

At Americaquest Field, the Yankees edge the Rangers, 11-10, getting homers
from Posada, Matsui and Sheffield. Texas is paced by Alfonso Soriano who

as the only 2B in major league history to have 4 straight 20-homer seasons.

The Indians send OF Jody Gerut to the Cubs. In return, Cleveland gets
bluechipper Jason Dubois.

Papelbon getting the save), Jason Varitek establishes a new team record
catching his 991st game with the Red Sox. The Boston captain surpasses the

Teahen's 2nd inning single is KC's only safety in Lester's 8 innings.

With a 14-5 victory over the Cardinals, the Braves become the first team
since the 1930 Yankees to score ten or more runs in five consecutive

Atlanta has tallied 65 runs.

After signing a one-day contract with the Kansas City T-Bones and being
'traded' during the game to the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, 94-year-old Buck
O'Neil walks twice, once for each team, in the Northern League All-Star Game
to become the oldest man ever to make a plate appearance in a professional
baseball game. The former Negro League star surpasses 83-year-old Jim Eriotes,
who struck out playing for the Sioux Falls Canaries earlier in the month,
but doesn't break Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe's mark, who threw one pitch
in 1999 for the Schaumburg Flyers at the age of 96.

The Mets defeat the Reds, 8-3. Carlos Beltran hits a grand slam for New York,
becoming the 23rd player in history to hit a slam in consecutive games.

are hoping the former Mariners first baseman, who has the lowest batting
average in the major leagues hitting just .218 overall but .344 against
lefties, can add a potent bat when the club faces southpaws.

Billy Joel, in the last concert to be hosted at Shea Stadium, gets a little
help from his friends as Paul McCartney joins him on stage and sings "I
Saw Her Standing There" to a tremendous ovation from the sold-out crowd of

'blast' playing at Shea that night in 1965, the year after the Mets home
ballpark opened.

2009

caught the first pitch in franchise history in 1993.

2021
Alex Reyes of the Cardinals, closing out the Cardinals 2-1 victory against
the San Francisco Giants, set the Major League record for most consecutive
saves to start a career. With his 24th straight save, he broke the record

Reyes failed to convert the save, ending his streak at 24 games.
