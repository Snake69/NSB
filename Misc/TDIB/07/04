Jul 4

1901
In Pittsburgh, the Giants split a doubleheader, winning the a.m. game 5-3,
then losing to the Bucs, 12-0, in the afternoon game. Christy Mathewson is
the winner in the morning, scattering 11 hits, striking out 10 and walking 6.

1902
At Exposition Park the Pirates literally splash their way to a doubleheader
shutout over visiting Brooklyn, winning 3-0 and 4-0 behind Jesse Tannehill
and Jack Chesbro. Tannehill allows 3 runners to reach 1B in an errorless
game for the Bucs. Because of heavy rains and flooding from the Alleghany
River, a portion of the first game and all of the second are played with
part of the field under water (according to Ed Luteran). The water is about
thigh-deep in center and right fields, and about head-deep in deep center
field, where any ball hit is a single. Players occasionally catch a ball
and dive under the water.

1903
The first place Boston Americans sweep two from the visiting St. Louis
Americans, winning 4-1 and 2-0.

The Pirates win a pair from the Phillies, 7-4 and 7-1, but lose player-manager
Fred Clarke when he tumbles after a fly ball and separates his shoulder. He
will be out 4 1/2 weeks.

1904
Jack Chesbro, the New York Highlanders spitballer, wins his 14th in a row,
an AL record until Walter Johnson wins 16 straight in 1912. The A's lose
both today, as the Highlanders sweep the 3-game series.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants sweep a doubleheader from the Phils to run
their win streak to 18 games. This ties the record of the 1894 Orioles. New
York wins the opener, 4-1, behind Dummy Taylor then takes the nitecap, 11-3,
behind Christy Mathewson. Matty leaves after 7 innings, leading 11-1. The
streak of 18 games matches one rung up by the 1885 White Stockings and
the 1894 Baltimore Orioles ... the record is 20 games, held by the 1884
Providence Grays.

In Pittsburgh, the Colts and Pirates celebrate the holiday by racking up a
record 9 triples in the afternoon end of a doubleheader. Pittsburgh has 6
of the triples and wins, 11-6. Chicago wins the morning game, 7-2. Chicago
infielder Davy Jones breaks his leg in a collision with Pirate catcher
Harry Smith.

1905
In an A.M.-P.M, doubleheader between Boston and Philadelphia, the A's
take the morning game 5-2, using pitchers Eddie Plank, Coakley and Rube
Waddell on the mound to beat Jesse Tannehill. The afternoon contest proves
a classic as Philadelphia's Rube Waddell bests Cy Young in a 20-inning
marathon, when the Athletics prevail, 4-2. Both hurlers pitch a complete
game. It is an AL record that will last a year. Boston outhits the A's,
15 to 13, but the 38-year-old Young loses on an error, hit batsman and two
hits. Young walks nobody in the 20 innings, while 1B Bob Unglaub records
31 putouts. Philadelphia C Ossee Schreckengost works 28 innings in one day,
a ML record.

At the Baker Bowl, the Phillies split with the Giants, winning the first game,
2-0, as Jack Sutthoff outpitches Christy Mathewson. Sutthoff allows just 3
hits. Joe McGinnity earns the split in the nitecap with a 6-3 victory. The
Giants are now 7 games ahead of the Pirates.

The Cardinals trade INF Dave Brain to Pittsburgh for George McBride.

Bugs Raymond of Charleston, SC (South Atlantic) pitches the morning and
afternoon games of a doubleheader, throwing a no-hitter in each game.

1906
At Pittsburgh, the visiting Cubs and Pirates deal aces today with Chicago
coming out on top in both games by 1-0 scores. In a classic match, Three
Finger Brown beats Lefty Leifield, 1-0, in the lid lifter with both pitchers
firing one-hitters. It is just the 2nd double one-hitter in history, the
first occurring on August 20, 1886. Leifield collects the only Buc shot
off Brown while holding Chicago hitless until Jimmy Slagle's safety in the
9th inning. Slagle scores on a sacrifice, error and ground out. Brown will
toss 9 shutouts this year. In the 2nd game, Carl Lundgren tosses another
1-0 shutout for Chicago, beating Vic Willis. When Brown and Leifield face
off on September 6, Brown will again allow just one hit.

After the White Sox beat the Browns yesterday, 5-3 and 8-0, St. Louis
retaliates by winning, 8-0, before losing 5-3. The Sox attendance is
10,000. Major league attendance for today's holiday games has the AL with
75,000 and the NL at 68,000.

1907
The Cubs pin a pair of holiday losses on the visiting Cincinnati Reds,
beating them 5-1 and 2-0. Three Finger Brown wins the opener and Orval
Overall shuts out the Reds in game 2, beating Bob Ewing. For Ewing, it is
the first of a string of 10 straight losses to the Cubs.

The Browns and Tigers have the offensive outing of the holiday as they
combine for a ML-record 12 triples between them (until 2005 the record was
thought to be 10, set on September 15, 1901). Seven triples were hit in
the morning game, with Detroit winning, 9-4. Claude Rossman is the only
one with 2 triples. The afternoon game, a 7-6 Detroit win, has another 5
triples hit to combine for the record.

1908
Lefthander Hooks Wiltse pitches a 10-inning no-hitter for the Giants over the
Phillies, 1-0. He loses his bid for a perfect 9 innings when, with 2 outs,
he hits Phils P George McQuillan with a pitch on a 1-2 count. Ump Charles
Rigler calls the pitch earlier a ball, to the dismay of Hooks and the fans,
who thought it a strike. Art Devlin scores the winner in the 10th after
singling off George McQuillan and coming around on two errors. New York
wins the nitecap more easily, 9-3, behind Dummy Taylor.

In Pittsburgh, an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader with the Cubs draws 50,000
fans. Three Finger Brown wins the morning game, 2-0, for his 4th straight
shutout. Ed Reulbach takes the afternoon affair, 9-3. The Cubs and Bucs play
5 games in 3 days with the Cubs winning three ... Three Finger Brown cops 2,
tossing two shutouts - a 6-hitter and a 2-hitter.

1910
In an a.m.-p.m. doubleheader, the Giants sweep two from Brooklyn. Mathewson
pitches 5 innings of shutout relief in the morning, and when Fred Merkle
singles home Bridwell in the 13th, the Giants win 6-5. New York rolls to
a 12-1 victory in the nitecap. New York is now 1 1/2 games behind the Cubs.

1911
In the morning game between Chicago and Detroit, Ed Walsh stops Ty Cobb's
40-game hitting streak as the White Sox win, 7-3. Though neither Detroit paper
mentions the streak, Cobb has hit .491 since the skein started on May 15th.

The Phillies mug the Giants, 7-5, literally knocking New York P Doc Crandall
out of the box, when he is hit with a line drive by Red Dooin. Doc gets
relief from Rube Marquard, but Pete Alexander picks up the win. Fred Luderus
strokes 2 homers for the Quakers.

In game 1 at Chicago, Wildfire Schulte, hits a 3rd-inning grand slam off Bob
Keefe to lead the Cubs to an 8-3 win over the Reds. Reggie Richter is the
victor. Down 8-1, Cincinnati uses the game to debut their two Cuban signees,
Rafael Almeida and Armando Marsans, as pinch hitters in the 8th. The two are
the first Cuban-born major leaguers in the 20th century. Almeida strikes
out, but Marsans singles, the first Cuban to collect a ML hit in the 20th
century. Almeida has a hit in his next at-bat in the game. The second game
ends at 2-2 after ten innings.

1912
Three weeks after the Tigers ask waivers on George Mullin, he pitches
himself a 32nd birthday (and a National birthday) present at Detroit,
a 7-0 no-hitter over the Browns. Mullin helps his victory with 3 hits and
2 RBIs. In the morning game, a 9-3 Detroit win, Ty Cobb steals 2B, 3B and
home in the 5th inning against the battery of Baumgartner and Krichell,
the 4th time he has accomplished this feat ... he did it last July. Cobb
has stolen home 5 times this season; this is his first swipe of home in
his last 8 successes that didn't occur in the 1st inning.

Boston's Smoky Joe Wood loses, 4-3, at the hands of the Athletics' Eddie
Plank. Wood will win his next start on July 8th, the first of 16 in a row
and will finish the year at 34-5. The A's win game 2 of the doubleheader, 6-5.

Brooklyn ends the Giants' win streak of 16 games by sweeping a doubleheader,
10-3 and 5-2. The Superbas take the a.m. game, cuffing Mathewson for 5 runs
on 5 hits in 3 innings. Hooks Wiltse is the loser in the afternoon contest,
but the Giants are still in the lead by 14 1/2 games.

1913
In the first of 2 today, Red Sox pitcher Joe Wood smokes two doubles in the
4th inning against the visiting A's, setting a ML record for pitchers. Boston
wins, 13-6, then loses the 2nd game, 5-3.

1914
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants sweep an A.M.-P.M. twinbill from the Phils,
winning 5-4 and 3-0. Mathewson, in winning the shutout, records his 350th
victory.

The Dodgers drum the Braves, sweeping a doubleheader, 7-5 in 11 innings and
4-3 in the nitecap. The nitecap is especially hard fought ... Lefty Tyler
plunks Dodger SS Ollie O'Mara on the neck and when Jack Daubert crosses
the plate with the winning run in the 9th, he collides with Braves C Hank
Gowdy and is knocked unconscious. Boston (26-40) is 10 1/2 games in back
of New York.

Turnabout is fair play. The Pittfeds sweep a pair from Baltimore, winning
5-1 and 8-7. In the 8th inning of the opener, Pitt SS Eddie Holly nabs
Harvey Russell with the hidden ball trick. Baltimore's Otto Knabe pulled
it against Pittsburgh 5 weeks ago.

1915
Led by Al Shaw who hits three triples, Kansas City (FL) beats St. Louis, 14-5.

With only four NL teams playing this Sunday, the Reds take a pair from St.
Louis at Redland Field. Gene Dale pitches a shutout to win the opener,
1-0. He drives in the only run. The Reds prevail 3-2 in game 2, called
after 7 innings because of darkness.

1916
In a doubleheader Boston sweep, Joe Jackson goes 3 for 5 against the
Athletics. In 30 games since May 31st, he has hit 55 for 104, a .524 BA. The
Red Sox win, 11-2 and 5-2.

Against Brooklyn, Christy Mathewson relieves in the 1st, and the Giants
score 5 in the bottom of the inning to take the lead. Three errors and 4
hits in the 5th undo Matty and he loses, 7-6. The Dodgers sweep both games
from the 6th place Giants.

1918
There are few fireworks today as the Cubs whitewash the Cards, winning both
games by a 1-0 score. Lefty Tyler, in extra innings, and Claude Hendrix
are the winners over Red Ames and Bill Doak. Tyler and Hippo Vaughn will
tie for the NL lead in shutouts this year with 8.

Behind Rube Marquard and Jack Coombs, the Dodgers take a pair from the
Giants. Rube shuts out the Giants, 2-0, in the first game, which begins at
10:15 a.m. Coombs, the Kennebunk Express, overcomes seven Brooklyn errors
to win the afternoon contest, 4-3. Coombs scores the winning run after
hitting a 10th inning triple, his third hit of the game. Jimmy Hickman adds
a 4th-inning homer.

Despite the heroics of Ty Cobb at Comiskey Park, the White Sox sweep two
from the Tigers, winning 7-6 in 12 innings, then 2-1. Cobb is 5 for 6 in the
1st game, and goes from 1st to 3rd on a sacrifice bunt. Playing 1B in the
nitecap, Ty pulls the hidden ball trick on Joe Benz, the winning pitcher
for Chicago. Ed Cicotte is the winner in game one over Hooks Dauss.

In Washington, the Yankees split with the Senators while Cleveland wins
twice over the Browns. Cleveland (43-32) takes over first from New York
(38-29) and Boston (40-31). The Yankees win the morning game, 7-0, behind
the pitching of Bob Shawkey and the slugging of Frank Baker. Baker collects a
homer, double and 2 singles, and adds 2 singles in the afternoon contest. The
Yankees rap 9 hits off Walter Johnson in the p.m. game, but shoddy fielding
gives the Nats a 4-3 win.

Boston splits with the A's, taking the morning contest 11-9. Starting pitcher
Sad Sam Jones is rapped for 9 hits in 5 2/3 innings, but is awarded the
victory. Ruth is not used in the morning game, but returns to the lineup in
the nitecap, striking out twice, as Scott Perry outpitches Carl Mays for the
2-1 11-inning A's victory. With every team in the majors playing twinbills,
this is one of seven extra-inning games today ... this won't be matched until
August 15, 1998 when half (7) the games go extra frames. Also, 11 of the
games are one-run affairs, a mark that won't be matched until April 14, 2001.

At London's Chelsea football grounds, 18,000 people, including King George
and the royal family, watch an American Army team defeat a U.S. Navy team,
2-1. The King is prevented from tossing out the first ball by the netting
in front of the royal box, and instead walks onto the field and hands the
ball to umpire Arlie Latham.

In a Steel League morning game at Lehigh Stadium in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
Dutch Leonard strikes out 18 to defeat Jeff Tesreau, 2-0. The game draws
4,000. The afternoon game, featuring the pitching of former major leaguers
Lefty Baumgartner and Al Mamaux, draws 18,000.

1919
In the morning game of an A.M.-P.M. doubleheader, the Giants' Jesse Barnes
hurls a 3-1 one-hit win over the Phils. The only hit is Gavvy Cravath's
homerun. The Giants repeat in the afternoon, 8-4.

In the morning game, the Reds' Edd Roush sets a ML record for outfielders
(later topped in the AL by Ben Chapman) by making 6 straight putouts. Roush
makes no more POs as the Reds win in 13 innings over the host Cardinals,
4-3. Cincy also takes the p.m. game, 4-2.

1920
In Washington, the Nats top the Yanks, 5-2, with Shaw winning over Jack
Quinn. Meanwhile, the Indians are beating the Tigers, 11-3, to reclaim
first place.

At Reading, Pennsylvania, Toronto shortstop Frank O'Rourke has six hits in
a game against Rochester (IL). O'Rourke also had six hits on opening day
for Toronto.

1921
In the 2nd of 2 at New York, the Yankees' Carl Mays submarines the A's, 14-4
for his 14th straight win over Philadelphia. Bob Shawkey wins the opener,
6-4 as Home Run Baker clubs 2 with Ruth on each time. Baker will total 16
homeruns for 1921-22, all coming at the Polo Grounds.

Washington sweeps a pair from the Red Sox, 4-1 and 7-2. In the nitecap they
score 5 runs in the 9th when Joe Bush runs out of bullets.

1923
In the 10th inning at Cleveland, Detroit C Larry Woodall is forced out at
2B. He protests the call and gets tossed, leaving manager Cobb with no
catchers available (as noted by Retrosheet). In comes 41-year-old coach
Fred Carisch, who last played in 1914 (for the Indians). Manager Speaker
protests, saying Carisch is not on the eligible list, but 2 walks and a
homerun by Indian pinch hitter Glen Myatt leave Tris speechless. Cleveland
wins, 10-7, and drops the 2nd game, 15-3.

In the 2nd game in NY, the Yanks' Fred Hoffman hits a HR off Walter Johnson as
the Yankees veto the Senators, 12-2. Dave Danforth is the winning pitcher. New
York scores 12 in the opener as well, winning 12-6.

1924
In a twinbill split, Phils SS Heinie Sand handles 18 chances against the
Giants, falling one short of Danny Richardson's record set on June 20,
1892. The Giants win, 8-2, then fall, 5-2.

1925
In a battle of southpaws at Yankee Stadium, the Athletics' Lefty Grove
and the Yankees' Herb Pennock battle for 15 innings before Grove takes a
1-0 loss. Pennock is a model of control, issuing no walks and giving up 4
hits. He retires the first 18 batters as well as the last 21 batters in what
he later calls the best game of his career. Grove allows 14 hits and walks 5.

1926
The Cubs blank the visiting Reds, 2-0, as Charlie Root beats Emil Yde.

1927
Before an estimated crowd of 75,000 at Yankee Stadium, the Senators are
pounded in both games by the first-place Yankees. In the opener, the Yanks
quickly put to rest the Senators' 10-game win streak by scoring 8 runs
in 4 innings off Sloppy Thurston. New York is scoreless against reliever
Walter Johnson until the 8th when they score 4 runs, 2 on a HR by Gehrig,
to win, 12-1. Gehrig adds another in the nitecap, a 21-1 cakewalk for New
York. Every starter collects a hit in both games, except for the 2nd game
winner Wilcey Moore. George Pipgras is the opening game winner. New York
gets 5 safeties from Babe Ruth and Joe Dugan for the afternoon.

At Ebbets Field, the Giants twice clip the Robins, winning 4-3 in 11 innings,
then taking the nitecap, 9-4. George Harper's single off Jim Elliot brings
home the winning run in the opener ... Rogers Hornsby thought he had clouted
the winning homer when he lofts a drive over the flagpole on the RF line,
but after completing his trot around the bases, finds out it was called
foul. Rajah hits a 3-run homer in the nitecap as Burleigh Grimes coasts
home with a victory.

Cleveland sweeps two from the White Sox, winning 2-0 in the A.M. contest
behind Dutch Levsen's 2-hitter, then taking the nitecap, 6-2. Tioga George
Burns is 4 for 4, with his 29th and 30th doubles in the nitecap, to back
Joe Shaute's pitching.

The Pirates draw 60,000 in sweeping the World Champion Cardinals, 7-2
and 6-4. Lee Meadows (11-2) scatters 8 hits - half by Lester Bell -
in outpitching Pete Alexander in the morning contest. Alexander allows
11 hits in his 7 innings. Watty Holm's 8th-inning HR, off Carmen Hill,
ties the afternoon game, but Clyde Barnhart answers with a 2-run double,
to keep the Bucs a half-game ahead of Chicago.

The Cubs sweep at home, beating the Reds, 6-3 and 2-1 in 10 innings. Lefty
Brillheart scatter 3 hits in 9 innings as the Cubs take it in the 10th
on Hack Wilson's double. Guy Bush wins the morning game with an inning
of relief, then picks up another W in the afternoon on 7 2/3 innings of
relief. Jakie May and Pete Donohue are the losing pair.

The Red Sox finally manage a victory, beating the A's 13-3, but not until
they run their losing streak to 15 games with a 10-2 loss. Lefty Grove
fans 10 Codsmen in the opener to end the A's loss streak at 7. Cobb adds 2
stolen bases for the Mackmen. Hooks Wiltse is near invincible for Boston in
the afternoon as every Sox player collects a hit, with Billy Rogell leading
the way with 2 triples and a single.

Milt Gaston allows 8 runs in 9 innings against Detroit, but his St. Louis
teammates hit 4 homers as the Browns are victorious, 17-8. George Sisler
adds 3 stolen bases including a clean steal of home.

1928
Ray Schalk resigns as White Sox manager effective after today's
doubleheader. Schalk then inserts himself into the first game's lineup as
catcher, his only appearance of the year. Starting for the Sox is 23-year-old
Ed Walsh Jr, making his major league debut. Walsh's father pitched for
years with Schalk as his catcher, making Schalk the only backstop to catch a
father and a son in the majors. Young Ed's debut is forgettable as he gives
up 5 runs to the Browns in 4 innings. Schalk leaves the game with Walsh and
St. Louis wins, 11-8. Schalk's managerial replacement is Lena Blackburne who
will last one year and in 1930 will start selling his Rubbing Mud from the
Delaware River to the AL for use in taking the shine off of baseballs. The
NL will adopt it in the 1950s.

The Yanks split with the Senators, losing 5-2 before winning, 5-4. The split
leaves the Yankees with a 53-17 mark and a 12 game edge over the rest of
the AL pack.

After a 6-0 win in game 1, the Reds sweep in game 2 as 3B Chuck Dressen
scores 5 runs to lead the Reds to an 11-3 win over Pittsburgh.

1929
After singling in the 8th, the Cubs' Hack Wilson jumps into the Reds dugout
to fight pitcher Ray Kolp, who has been needling him. Wilson is stopped and
ejected before reaching Kolp, and is also tagged out by Chuck Dressen. The
Cubs win 10-5, and that evening, when both teams are at Chicago's Union
Station awaiting trains, Wilson floors Reds pitcher Pete Donahue. Wilson
will be briefly suspended for the fight. Later in the year, Wilson will go
into the stands to floor a heckler. The heckler suffers a cut lip and sues
Wilson for $20,000 but the charges are dismissed.

San Francisco (PCL) slugger Babe Pinelli takes advantage of his read on the
Seattle rookie catcher, who is tipping the pitches by the way he holds his
glove and goes 6 for 6 in a 22-10 slugfest. Pinelli has 3 homeruns including
two grand slams and 12 RBIs (as noted by John Spalding).

1930
In the 1st of 2 games, Washington's Sam Jones shuts out the Yanks, 8-0. In
the nitecap Ruth hits his 32nd homer of the year, putting him 20 games
ahead of his 1927 pace, but the Nats win again, 7-3.

In the morning half of the holiday doubleheader, the Giants spot Brooklyn
ace Dazzy Vance a 4-0 cushion after six innings, then come back to win,
5-4 in 11 innings. Brooklyn wins the afternoon game, 5-2, to cling to their
precarious lead in the NL.

1931
Brooklyn stops their cross-town rival Giants with two shutouts, winning
4-0 behind Dazzy Vance and then 5-0 behind Watty Clark.

The Athletics buy veteran Waite Hoyt from Detroit and he joins the team
before the start of a doubleheader with the Red Sox. The Sox take the
morning game, 9-7, but Hoyt is the afternoon's hero, hitting a double and
single and pitching a complete-game 6-2 victory.

1932
In Washington, Yankees C Bill Dickey breaks Carl Reynolds' jaw with a
punch, sidelining the Senators OF indefinitely. Reynolds bowls over Dickey
on a successful squeeze play in the nitecap. Dickey is suspended for 30
days - supposedly the length of Reynolds' recuperation - and assessed
a $1,000 fine. Reynolds is hitting over .360 but will end the season
at .305. The Senators take both games from the league-leaders, winning,
5-3 and 12-6. There are 5 homers in the nitecap, as Ruth, Lary, Crosetti,
Manush and Harris connect.

At Philadelphia, the 2nd place Braves sweep a pair from the Phils, 8-6 and
9-0. Boston's Socks Seibold fires a 5 hitter in the nitecap, with Chuck
Klein collecting 4 of the hits, including a HR. Losing pitcher Collins has
the other. Red Worthington has 3 hits and 3 RBIs in each game.

Baltimore's (IL) Buzz Arlett again hits 4 HRs in a game, one grand slam from
the right side of the plate, and the other 3 HRs from the left side, with
Reading again the victim. It is the 2nd time Arlett has accomplished the feat
in 5 weeks. Baltimore wins, 21-10, then ekes out a game-2 7-inning win, 9-8.

1933
The Washington Senators widen their lead over the 2nd-place Yankees to 2 1/2
games with a double-bill win before 77,365 holiday fans at Yankee Stadium,

a pair in Boston, 3-0 and 8-3.

In Philadelphia, the Red Sox pound the A's, 14-4 and 9-1.

1934
When Dodgers manager Casey Stengel comes out to the mound to remove P Boom
Boom Beck from the game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl, the frustrated Beck
turns and fires the ball at the tin wall in RF. Dodgers OF Hack Wilson,
not paying attention to the happenings, hears the ball clang off the wall,
and hurries to retrieve it. He then fires a strike to 2B to prevent the
imaginary runner from advancing.

Kiki Cuyler sparks the Cubs' 6-2 second-game win over the Cards by stroking
three doubles and a triple and scores 3 runs at Sportsman's Park. Jim Weaver
is the winner in game 2. The Cards take the opener by the same score.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants tomahawk the Braves, scoring 29 runs in two
games today. New York wins the opener, 14-5, then Carl Hubbell coasts to a
15-0 win in the nitecap. After the finish of all the holiday doubleheaders,
the Giants have a clear lead of 3 1/2 games ahead of the Cubs and 4 1/2 in
front of the Cardinals.

The AL race has seesawed between the Yankees and Detroit with New York
only one game ahead. The improved Red Sox are 6 1/2 behind, and Washington,
last year's winner, 7 back and dropping fast.

Satchel Paige pitches a 4-0 no-hitter against the Negro League Homestead
Grays in Pittsburgh, with only a walk and an error spoiling a perfect
game. Paige strikes out 17. Paige then enters in game two as a reliever and
is tagged with the loss. In his next start on July 8, Satch shuts out the
host Chicago American Giants 5-0 in 10 innings. In Paige's autobiography,
he erroneously recalls that he threw the no-hitter in Pittsburgh, then drove
all night to Chicago and beat the Giants the next day, but researcher Dave
Marasco corrected Satch's story.

1935
Due to his 'wandering' ball, Iola hurler Harold 'Lefty' Liell, a 5' 6 1/2"
155-pounder with pigeon-toed feet, is called up for a try out with the Kansas
City Blues. K.C. manager Dutch Zwilling is impressed with the youngster's
performance, but advises the Greeley, Kansas lad to get more experience
and suggests he play in the Ban Johnson League.

The Cardinals move into 2nd place with a twin win over the Cubs, The Cards
manage just 3 hits off Charlie Root in the opener, but win 5-3. In the
nitecap, 4 Cub errors help Dizzy Dean to a 6-4 win. St. Louis trails the
Giants by 9 games at the season's midpoint.

1937
Bob Feller makes his 2nd start of the season and takes his 2nd loss,
dropping a 3-2 decision to Detroit in a 7-inning game. Rain shortened the
scheduled doubleheader.

1938
The Phillies move into Shibe Park by splitting a twin bill with the Boston
Bees (Braves) losing the first game, 10-5, and winning the nightcap,
10-2. Problems with the Baker Bowl made it necessary for the Phils to share
the Athletics' home field at 21st Street and Lehigh Avenue.

In a game interrupted by a deluge of bottles following an unpopular call,
the visiting Yankees outpoll the Senators, 10-5, behind Red Ruffing. Gehrig
drives in three runs for the New Yorkers. Yanks SS Frank Crosetti nabs
George Case with the hidden ball trick. Game 2 ends in a 4-4 tie.

In their first appearance at Shibe Park, the Phillies split with the Boston
Bees, losing 10-5, then winning 10-2.

In the second of a pair, Dodger Luke Hamlin has the dubious distinction
of serving up two grand slams to the Giants. Dick Bartell and Gus Mancuso
do the honors, the second time in two months that teammates have slammed
in a game. New York rolls 16-1 after winning the opener, 3-0, behind Hal
Schumacher.

1939
It's Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium. After emcee Sid Mercer
informs the sell-out crowd (61,808) at Yankee Stadium the man of the hour
is too moved to speak, Gehrig changes his mind when Skipper Joe McCarthy
encourages him, and delivers a short and moving speech in between games with
the Senators:  "Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad
break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the
earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years and I have never received
anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans. Look at these grand
men. Which of you wouldn't consider it the highlight of his career just to
associate with them for even one day? Sure, I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider
it an honor to have known Jacob Ruppert? Also, the builder of baseball's
greatest empire, Ed Barrow? To have spent six years with that wonderful
little fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to have spent the next nine years with
that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager
in baseball today, Joe McCarthy? Sure, I'm lucky. When the New York Giants,
a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a
gift, that's something. When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those
boys in white coats remember you with trophies, that's something. When you
have a father and mother who work all their lives so that you can have an
education and build your body, it's a blessing. When you have a wife who has
been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed,
that's the finest I know. So I close in saying that I might have had a bad
break, but I have an awful lot to live for. Thank you." His teammates give
Gehrig a silver trophy with all their signatures on it and inscribed with
the following poem by writer John Kieran:
"We've been to the wars together;
We took our foes as they came;
And always you were the leader,
And ever you played the game.
Idol of cheering millions;
Records are yours by the sheaves;
Iron of frame they hailed you,
Decked you with laurel leaves.
But higher than that we hold you,
We who have known you best;
Knowing the way you came through
Every human test.
Let this be a silent token
Of lasting friendship's gleam
And all that we've left unspoken.
---Your pals of the Yankee team"
Gehrig's uniform number 4 is then retired, the first ML player so honored. The
Yankees split, losing the opener, 3-2, to Dutch Leonard and taking the
nitecap, 11-1. George Selkirk homers in both games, and adds a triple and
single in the nitecap. Sundra wins over Alex Carrasquel.

At Shibe Park, Red Sox 3B Jim Tabor hits 4 HRs as Boston sweeps Philadelphia
17-7 and 18-12 as the two teams combine for a ML record 54 runs in the
twinbill. Jimmie Foxx and Tabor lead the plating with 7 runs apiece,
with Tabor scoring 5 runs in game 2. Three of Tabor's HRs, including a
record-tying two grand slams (matches Lazzeri, in 1936, also against the
Philadelphia Athletics), come in the nightcap, the first Red Sox player to
clout three in a game. He totals 19 bases and 11 RBIs in the two slugfests on
an afternoon featuring 65 hits. Boston accounts for 35 of them. Joe Heving
and Denny Galehouse are the Boston winners, while A's hurlers Cotton Pippen
and Chubby Dean are the losers. Making his debut in game 1 as a pinch hitter
is Eddie Collins Jr, son of Sox GM Eddie Collins.

Cubs CF Hank Lieber clouts 3 homers, but the Cardinals win 6-4 in the first
of two games at Wrigley Field. The Cubs take the nitecap, 3-2, when Gus
Mancuso drives home the winning run in the 10th inning.

1940
The Tigers draw the largest crowd in their history, 56,272, for the
first-place showdown with the Indians. Detroit takes the opener, 5-3,
behind Tommy Bridges' complete game. The Indians bounce back to win the
nitecap in 11 innings, 2-1, to regain first place. Their previous largest
crowd was last year on opening day at the newly enlarged Briggs Stadium.

Ab Wright of Minneapolis (AA) follows one HR in the morning game of a holiday
doubleheader with 4 HRs and a triple - 19 total bases - against St. Paul
at Nicollet Park. Wright's first homer in game two is a monster shot that
clears the centerfield wall. His 4 homers in a game ties the 1935 mark of
Dale Alexander of KC off Steve Sundra of Minneapolis, and the 19 TB is a new
AA record. The Millers win the 2nd game, 17-5, after losing the a.m. game,
3-2. Wright will win the AA Triple Crown, hitting .369, 39 HRs and 159 RBIs.

1941
At Chicago, the Cards drop a doubleheader to the Cubs, 6-5 and 5-2, to drop
a full game in back of the rained-out Dodgers.

In front of 6,013 in Boston, Manuel Salvo breaks his 10-game loss streak,
beating the Braves, 4-3. Jim Tobin allows 2 hits in shutting out the Phils
in game 2, 2-0.

1942
The Dodgers (51-20) stretch their first-place lead to 9 1/2 games with a
twinbill win at Philadelphia. Kirby Higbe wins the opener, 14-0, and Johnny
Allen takes the nightcap, 5-4.

In the only single game played today, Bucky Walters of the Reds shuts out
the Pirates, 2-0.

At Boston, the first-place Yankees split a pair with the second-place Red
Sox. Red Ruffing wins the opener, 6-3, and Tex Hughson is the victor in the
nitecap for the Sox, 6-4. Johnny Pesky helps Tex by nabbing Tommy Henrich
in the 8th inning with a hidden ball trick.

In the 8th inning of an 8-4 Negro League victory over the Newark Eagles at
Yankee Stadium, Baltimore Elite Giants spitball ace Bill Byrd beans Eagles
manager Willie Wells. Wells is carried from the field, and the incident
causes him to design a batting helmet. When he steps into the batter's box
Thursday he will be wearing a modified construction worker's hardhat.

1944
Sig Jakucki, the Browns' 31-year-old rookie, throws his 3rd shutout in 4
games, blanking the Athletics, 4-0. Sig has given up 1 run in 27 innings. The
win keeps the Browns 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston. The A's win the nitecap,
8-3, behind Hot Potato Hamlin, who strands 10 runners. Frankie Hayes has
a HR to tie for the AL lead with 9.

Baltimore's Oriole Park, erected in 1914 for the Federal League, burns
down. The team moves to the city's unroofed Municipal Stadium. It will be
used this way until a second tier is added when the St. Louis Browns move
in for the 1954 season.

1945
The Cards sweep two from the Giants at the Polo Grounds, winning 8-4 and
9-2. Augie Bergamo leads the way with 9 RBI, 8 in the 2nd game, on 10 hits,
including 2 HRs. His 2nd HR, in the nitecap, is a grand slam.

In the first game against Cleveland, the Indians tie a ML record with
no assists, a first ever for a 9-inning game, in beating the Yankees,
4-2. Sidearmer Steve Gromek allows just 5 hits, including a Russ Derry
homer, in winning, as the outfield pulls down 15 flyballs. Two years ago,
the Browns went 8 innings without an assist ... the Mets will be the next
team to pull it off, on June 25, 1989. New York takes the nitecap, 3-2,
as Al Gettel beats Allie Reynolds.

At Chicago, Harlond Clift leads a Senators sweep by hitting 3 homers and
driving in 9 runs. One of his homers comes in the opener, a 5-4 12-inning win
with Marino Pieretti (9-4) going the distance. In the 11-2 nitecap win, Clift
belts 2 homers, one a grand slam. These are the final 3 homers of his career.

The A's snap a 14-game losing streak, beating the Browns, 3-2, in the lid
lifter. They almost win the nitecap, but the Browns rally in the 9th to win,
6-5. Pete Gray's bases-loaded single drives in the tying and winning runs.

1947
New York's Spud Chandler defeats the Senators, 7-3, for his final major league
victory. Bone chips in his pitching arm will sideline the 39-year-old vet,
but he'll end the year with the loop's 2nd best ERA (2.46). Joe Haynes will
top the AL with a 2.42 ERA.

1948
Ted Williams faces 3 pitchers in the 7th inning, a first in AL history, as
Boston snaps a 5-5 tie by scoring 14 runs on 14 RBIs to beat the visiting
Philadelphia Athletics, 20-8. A's pitcher Charlie Harris retires one batter
in 14 and coughs up 12 runs, before Bill McCahan takes over. Williams,
who makes the final out in the inning, and Bobby Doerr tie records by
drawing two walks apiece. Pitcher Ellis Kinder has two hits, off Harris and
McCahan. The 14 runs in one inning is a record, but 5 years later they will
do even better with 17 in one inning.

Braves rookie Johnny Antonelli, 18, makes his debut in the 8th inning of a
7-2 loss to the Phils, giving up 1 run on 2 hits. The Phils also win game
2 of the doubleheader.

Led by Roy Campanella's 1st 2 ML homers, the host Dodgers edge the Giants
13-12 in a wild game lasting 3 1/2 hours. 37 players see action, 20 by
Brooklyn, as both teams score 4 times in the 9th.

1949
The Dodgers increase their lead to 2 games over the Cardinals by winning 2
from the Phillies. Brooklyn takes the morning game, 7-1, behind Preacher
Roe, then win the afternoon encounter, 8-4, behind Newcombe. Robinson's
triple in the opener kayoes Simmons and Hodges greets Konstanty with his
12th homer. Da Bums score a pair in the 7th on Cox' homer and Hodge's RBI
single with Robinson scoring from 1st. Jones homers in the 9th for the
Phils. Reese, Edwards and Furillo homer in the nitecap.

The Redbirds divide with the Cubs, winning 9-4, Freddie Martin over Johnny
Schmitz, then losing 5-0 as Bob Chipman tops Al Brazle.

At New York, the Yankees sweep 2 games from Boston, thanks in part to
the weather. The 3-2 and 6-4 losses extend the Red Sox losing streak to 8
games. In the opener, the Sox enter the 9th trailing by a run despite homers
by Dom DiMaggio and Vern Stephens. When Raschi walks Stephens to load the
bases with one out, dark clouds suddenly block the sun and a violent wind
blows dust that obscures the outfielders. Boston batter Al Zarilla then
lines a single to LF, but Johnny Pesky, the runner on 3rd, can't see if the
ball is caught or not by Cliff Mapes. The perfect throw home forces Pesky,
and Doerr pops out. In game 2, Joe DiMaggio's 5th homer ties the game at
4-all in the 5th, and Billy Johnson's bases loaded single in the 7th off
Mel Parnell decides it. Darkness halts the 2nd game - delayed 48 minutes
because of rain - after 7 1/2 innings, leaving New York leading Boston by
12 games. The Yanks have drawn 1,005,343 for 35 home games.

1950
Braves slugger Sid Gordon ties the ML record (held by 6) for season grand
slams with 4 when he hits one against Phillies ace Jim Konstanty in the
9th. Boston's 12-9 win in game 2 gives the two teams a total of 40 runs,
55 hits and 90 total bases for the day. The Phils win the opener, 14-8,
helped by Andy Seminick's grand slam in the first inning. Robin Roberts is
handed a 9-0 lead after 4 innings and coasts home.

Before 49,316 at the Polo Grounds, the Dodgers and Giants split a
pair. Brooklyn loses their 6th straight in the opener, 5-4, before coming
back to win, 5-3. Newcombe takes the loss in game 1, despite hitting his
first ML HR. Alvin Dark has a homer in each game. A tragic note occurs when
a 56-year-old fan named Bernard Doyle is struck and killed by a bullet fired
from outside the stadium. The New York Daily News reports tomorrow that after
his body is removed the standing-room-only crowd fights over the vacant seat.

At Washington, the Yankees explode for 12 runs in the final 3 innings to
beat the Senators, 16-9, in the first of 2 games. Mickey Vernon and Joe
DiMaggio match bases-loaded triples to tie the AL mark for sack-filled
triples by 2 teams; it's the last time it is done this century. Bob Kuzava
and Ed Lopat battle to a 9-inning 3-3 tie in the nitecap

1951
In a wild doubleheader featuring a double ejection of manager Charlie
Dressen, the first-place Dodgers sweep the Giants, winning 6-5 in 11 innings,
and 4-2. The Dodgers drive out Sal Maglie in the opener after the Giants
built a lead on homers by Mueller and Mays. Brooklyn counters in the 8th
with a pinch homer by Campanella, a homer by Reese and a tying single from
Hodges. Bobby Thomson's homer in the 11th puts the Giants ahead by one, but
Preacher Roe wins it with a squeeze bunt. Ralph Branca wins the nitecap with
homer help from Hodges and Snider. Dressen is tossed in the 2nd inning of
game 2 for protesting pitch calls; after he takes a seat behind the dugout
umpire Robb tosses him a 2nd time. The victories put Brooklyn 6 1/2 games up.

1954
In a near no-hitter, Indians Mike Garcia, Ray Narleski and Early Wynn, in a
rare relief role, shut down the White Sox 2-1, only allowing Minnie Minoso's
9th-inning single. Minnie's single off Wynn comes with 2 outs in the 9th,
and he is then caught stealing. Red hot Larry Doby drives in both runs.

The Red Sox, behind lefty Leo Kielty, down the A's, 8-0. The A's have no
putouts in the game.

The Yankees purchase 35-year-old reliever Marlin Stuart from the Orioles.

1955
In Three-I League action, Keokuk Kernels' hurler, Mudcat Grant, hits three
homeruns in consecutive innings. During his 14 year major league career with
seven teams, the right-hander from Lacoochee, Florida will go yard six times.

The Red hot Red Sox sweep a pair from the Yankees at Boston, winning 4-2
and 10-5. Jackie Jensen, with a grand slam, and Norm Zauchin, with a 3 run
homer, pace the Hubmen in the nitecap. Russ Williams has a double and HR in
the opener to lead the offense. Nixon, with relief help from Ike Delock,
wins the opener. Delock strikes out 4 Yankees in the 9th. Reliever Hurd
wins the nitecap.

1957
George Crowe of the Reds goes 5 for 5 and drives in 6 runs against his old
Braves teammates, but Milwaukee wins 10-7.

At Kansas City, the A's go into the 9th down 4-0 against the White Sox,
then score 5 runs to win, 5-4. Joe DeMaestri slides across home with the
winner. The A's won't duplicate this until 2005.

At Yankee Stadium, pinchhitter Mickey Vernon hits a 2-out 2-run homer to
give the Red Sox a 3-2 win in game 1. Vernon's homer in game 2, off Don
Larsen, is the Bosox' only score as the Yankees win, 4-1.

1958
In the first of a twinbill, Bosox P Frank Sullivan beats the Orioles,
5-1, for the 7th straight time. He last lost to the O's on September 7,
1956. The O's take the nitecap, 5-3.

Bob Cerv, sidelined with a fractured toe, hits a pinch homer off Turk Lown
to give KC a sweep of the DH with Chicago, 6-5 and 4-3. The A's are in 2nd
place, 10 1/2 games behind the Yankees.

The Braves score one run in 18 innings, losing 5-1 and 4-0 to the Phils,
and see their NL lead drop to 1 1/2 games over the idle Cards. Curt Simmons
wins the opener over Rush, while Carl Sawatski, obtained recently from the
Braves, has a HR, a double, and 2 singles. Felix Mantilla's HR is the only
Braves tally. Sanford beats Spahn in the nitecap. A critical loss to the
Braves occurs when Red Schoendienst fractures his finger in game 1. He'll
play just 106 games this year, but will still lead the NL in fielding.

1959
Yankee Bob Turley turns in another one-hit masterpiece at Washington. A lazy
fly in the 9th by PH Julio Becquer drops in front of LF Norm Siebern for
the only Senator safety. SS Tony Kubek goes 8 for 10 in the doubleheader
as the Yanks sweep, 10-6 and 7-0.

1960
Mickey Mantle's 3-run first-inning HR off Hal Woodeshick is the 300th of
his career. Mantle becomes the 18th player to join the 300 club, but the
Yankees drop a 9-8 decision to Washington.

1961
Before 74,246 - the largest crowd at the Stadium since 1947 - the Yankees
split with the Tigers, winning the opener 6-2, before losing 4-3 in 10
innings.

At Metropolitan Stadium, the Twins sweep a pair from the White Sox, winning
the opener, 6-4, when Julio Becquer hits a 9th inning grand slam as a pinch
hitter. Cal McLish shuts out the Twins in game 2 until the 8th inning when the
Twins score 4 runs, 2 on Harmon Killebrew's only career inside-the-park-HR,
off Cal McLish. Appropriately, it is the Metro's first IPHR. The Twins win,
4-2, behind Jack Kralick.

At Chicago, the Giants close out their road trip by rolling to a 19-3 win
in game 1 while collecting 22 hits including a homer by Orlando Cepeda that
is one of the longest in Wrigley history. The Cubs come back in the nitecap
to win, 3-2, overcoming Willie Mays' 300th homer. At the half-way mark,
the Giants are in 3rd place, 5 1/2 games in back of the first-place Reds.

Johnny Antonelli returns to the Braves as the Indians sell the veteran back
to where he started as an 18-year-old pitcher.

1962
The Angels win for the 14th time in 20 games and move into first place by
sweeping Washington, 4-2 and 4-1, in DC.

The San Francisco Giants sign Santa Clara College P Bob Garibaldi for a
$150,000 bonus.

The Yanks and A's split in New York, with Kansas City winning the opener,
11-1, on five Yankee errors. In the nitecap, Mantle hits a 2-run homer in
the 5th to tie the game, and the Yanks score 5 in the 6th inning to ice it,
7-3. In the 6th, Mantle adds another homer, his 389th, to move into 7th
place on the all-time list, just ahead of Duke Snider.

1963
The Reds drop a pair to Houston, losing 5-2 and 6-2. A bright spot is Vada
Pinson who extends his batting streak to 23 games.

1964
Manny Jimenez, who went the entire 1963 season without a HR, hits 3, and goes
4 for 4 for Kansas City against Baltimore. The game ends in a 6-6 tie when
halted by a special curfew so a fireworks display can take place in Baltimore.

In New York, Minnesota is leading, 5-4, when Mantle parks a 3-run shot off
Al Worthington in the 8th to win it, 7-5.

1966
After getting hit by a pitch and sitting out seven games with a double
fractured cheekbone, Ron Santo sets a modern-day Chicago Cubs record by
hitting in his 28th straight game. However his team loses the opener of
a doubleheader to the Pittsburgh Pirates, 7-5. The Cubs win the nightcap,
6-4, but Santo is held hitless. His club record will be topped by Jerome
Walton in 1989. On June 1, 1966, the day after the Santo streak began,
he was held hitless in the first game of a doubleheader but received four
walks and a HBP in five plate appearances so the streak remained intact.

1967
The Mets end a 19-game losing streak to Juan Marichal with their first
win against the Dominican Dandy, 8-7. Marichal's win streak started in
1962. Jack Fisher is the winning pitcher.

against the Astros. The Phillies win the first, 9-0, and take the nightcap,
4-3 in 11 innings.

beat the Cubs, 8-3. It is the first decision between the pair and the first
brother pitching duel since the Barnes brothers 41 years ago.

In Minnesota, Mudcat Grant stops the Yankees to give the Twins an 8-3
victory. Mantle drives in all three New York runs with two homers.

The Yankees trade 1B Ray Barker plus cash and 2 players to be named (Chet
Trail and Joe Brady) to the Orioles for lefty Steve Barber. The former
20-game winner is damaged goods but will go 6-9 for the rest of the year.

1968
Ed Stroud pounds two doubles and two triples and his fellow Senators add
2 singles to beat the Yankees, 4-2. Jim Hannan is the winning pitcher.

In Detroit, it is homerun derby as the Tigers score 9 runs in the 2nd and
hold on for a 13-10 victory over the California Angels. Andy Messersmith
makes his ML debut to stop the Tigers in the third, but Norm Cash, Willie
Horton and Bill Freehan all homer in the frame. Jim Northrup, who triples in
the 3rd, adds 2 homers and 5 RBIs, while Cash hits a 2nd homer. Don Mincher,
with 2, and Jim Fregosi, homer for the Angels.

against the Braves in San Francisco, winning 7-6 and 7-3.

At Montreal, the Phillies lose their 1st road game, 8-5, after 9 straight
wins.

1970
The Cards send 3 pinch hitters to the plate in the 8th inning and all 3 strike

first-place O's, beating Detroit's Joe Coleman, 3-2.

1972
Leron Lee singles in the 9th to break up Tom Seaver's no-hitter, but the
Mets shut out the Padres, 2-0, in the opener. Seaver strikes out 11. The
Pads take the nitecap, 4-2, as Nate Colbert hits his 16th homer.

Denny McLain makes his NL debut in the 2nd game of a twinbill with the
Cubs called in the 8th inning because of rain. McLain gets no decision
in the 3-3 tie, but gets a standing ovation at the end from the crowd of
50,597. Atlanta wins the opener, 5-1, as Ron Reed beats Juan Pizarro. Paul
Casanova's first NL homer and Lum's 3-run homer in the 7th account for 4 runs.

1973
The Orioles get their 3rd come-from-behind win over the Brewers, this time
scoring 10 runs in the last 3 innings to win, 10-7.

Before 45,000 Twins fans, Eddie Bane, the top collegiate pitcher this year
and Minnesota's top pick, makes his ML debut against the Royals. Bane pitches
well for 7 innings, but the Royals emerge with a 5-4 win, beating reliever
Ray Corbin. Bane will finish the season at 0-5.

1974
Mike Marshall makes his 14th straight appearance and picks up a 3-2 win
over the Reds. Over the past 30 days, Marshall is 9-0 with 3 saves and a
1.82 ERA in 20 appearances.

Toby Harrah's 3rd-inning homer is the only hit for Texas, as Bert Blyleven
and the Twins win, 3-1.

1976
On the nation's bicentennial anniversary, Philadelphia splits a doubleheader
with Pittsburgh, 10-5 and 7-1. In the first game, after hitting an apparent
game-winning grand slam, Tim McCarver is credited with only a three-run single
when he passes teammate Garry Maddox on the base paths in the Phillies' 10-5
victory over the Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium. The other base runners
are allowed to score on the Philadelphia catcher's 'grand slam single'
because only the player who passes his teammate is called out and there
were less than two outs.

1977
The Boston Red Sox end their 9 game losing streak by walloping a
ML-record-tying and since topped, 8 HRs, in beating Toronto 9-6 at
Fenway. Seven of the homers are solo shots, another ML record. Four HRs
(Lynn, Rice, Yaz, Scott) come in the 8th inning. Only Scott's is not
consecutive. Lynn and Scott each have 2, while Rice, Yaz, Hobson and Carbo
have one apiece. The Sox' previous high for homers was 6 and they won't
top that number until 1999.

After 8 straight hits, Ron Cey is called out on strikes in the 9th in a
4-0 Dodger win over San Francisco. Cey had 5 hits the day before and 3
straight today.

In the first game of a doubleheader, Chicago outfielder Larry Biittner
pitches the last 1 1/3 innings for the Cubs, striking out 3. That's the
good news. The bad news is he allows 6 earned runs on 5 hits and a walk as
the Expos crush the Cubs, 19-3. Two of the three K's are of the opposing
pitcher, Jackie Brown, and the last is Larry Parrish, who had homered on
a 1-2 pitch from Biittner. Biittner also serves up homers to Valentine and
Dawson, each of whom have five ribbies. Biittner is later fined $50 by the
NL for throwing a "brush-back" pitch after surrendering the three homeruns,
but a collection is taken up to pay for his shave. Further bad news for
the Cubs is that Bruce Sutter is knocked out for the first time this year,
and a massive knot beneath his right shoulder will keep him out of the
All-Star game. The Cubs lose game 2, 7-6.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1979
The Phillies' Steve Carlton shuts out the Mets 1-0 on a one-hitter, but the
Phils manage to lose 3 other hurlers on the same day:  Larry Christenson
pulls a groin muscle, Dick Ruthven goes on the disabled list and Randy
Lerch fractures his thumb in a brawl.

1980
Reggie Smith belts the 7,000th homerun in Dodgers' history and Don Sutton
sets a team record with his 52nd career shutout in the Dodgers' 4-0 victory
over the Giants.

Nolan Ryan fans the Reds' Cesar Geronimo to become the 4th pitcher ever to
reach 3,000 career strikeouts. Ironically, Geronimo was also Bob Gibson's
3,000th career strikeout victim 6 years earlier. Despite the milestone,
Ryan allows 6 runs in 4 1/3 innings and Houston loses, 8-1.

George Hendrick hits a game-ending homer in the 10th off Kevin Saucier of
the Phils to give the Cards a 1-0 win.

During the first-ever fireworks night hosted at Shea Stadium, Montreal Expos
Rookie Bill Gullickson sailed a pitch over New York Mets first baseman Mike
Jorgensen's head in the second game of a doubleheader. Jorgensen didn't
appreciate this as he had been the victim of one of the worst beanball
injuries in baseball history the previous season with the Texas Rangers,
and motioned toward Gullickson his disapproval. Mets catcher John Stearns,
who wasn't even in the line-up for this game, charged out of the dugout
and welcomed Gullickson to the majors by slamming him to the ground.

1982
Celebrating Independence Day at Mile High Stadium in Denver, 65,666 fans
watch an American Association contest and enjoy a giant fireworks display
after the game. The gathering is the largest crowd in minor league history.

1983
Dave Righetti pitches the Yankees' first no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect
game in the 1956 World Series, handcuffing the Red Sox 4-0 before a holiday
crowd of 41,077 at Yankee Stadium. It's the first no-hitter by a Yankee
lefty since George Mogridge in 1917. Bert Campaneris at 3B participates
in his 11th no-hitter, a ML record (Hunter, Palmer, Wright, Blue, Bibby,
Bosman, Blue, Odom, Colburn and Blyleven).

1984
Phil Niekro strikes out 5 batters in the Yankees' 5-0 win over Texas to
become the 9th pitcher in ML history to record 3,000 career strikeouts
(Larry Parrish is the 3000th victim).

Jim Rice caps a 5 for 6 day with a grand slam in the bottom of the 10th
inning to give Boston a 13-9 win over Oakland.

1985
In a marathon game that borders on the surreal, the Mets endure 2 rain
delays and 6:10 of playing time to beat the Braves 16-13 in 19 innings on
Fireworks Night in Atlanta. The Mets had taken a 10-8 lead in the top of
the 13th inning, only to watch the Braves tie it up. The Mets score again
in the 18th, but relief hurler Rick Camp (a .060 hitter who was batting
because Atlanta had no more position players available to pinch-hit) ties
the score with his first ML homerun on a 2-out 2-strike pitch in the bottom
of the inning. No pitcher ever homered that late in a game before. Finally
the Mets erupt for 5 runs in the 19th off Camp and Atlanta can respond
only with 2. Keith Hernandez hits for the cycle for the Mets (2B in the
1st, 3B in the 4th, HR in the 8th and a 1B in the 12th, all off different
pitchers), and the game ends at 3:55 A.M. on July 5th, the latest finish in
ML history. After the 6-hour 10-minute game, the 1000 fans left in Atlanta
Fulton County Stadium are treated to pre-dawn fireworks which awaken and
frighten many of the ballpark's neighbors.

1986
At Comiskey Park, with the score 1-1 in the bottom of the 8th, Sox OF
John Cangelosi leads off with a drive to the RF corner. A fans leans
out of the stands and appears to touch the ball as he tumbles onto the
field. Anticipating an interference call, Yankee OF Claudell Washington
slows down, while the speedy Cangelosi easily makes 3B. The umps don't see
any interference and Cangelosi remains on 3B, and scores on a sac fly. The
Sox win 2-1.

1987
In a 7-player swap, the Padres trade pitchers Dave Dravecky and Craig Lefferts

innings for Cleveland, but gets no decision, ending his ML-record streak
of 15 consecutive saves.

1998
The National Baseball Facility of Ireland, considered the main home of the
Irish National baseball team, officially opens in Corkagh Demesne Park in
Clondalkin, West Dublin when U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy throws out the

home since the 1950 team, scoring 14 first inning runs, beat the Philadelphia
A's at Cleveland Stadium, 21-2.

Nomar Garciaparra ties the major league record for being hit by a pitch
in a game as he is plunked three times by three different Diamondback
pitchers in a 10-4 Los Angeles victory. The Dodger first baseman is the
first National Leaguer to equal the mark, both literally and figuratively,
since the 2000 season when Astros outfielder Richard Hidalgo got thwacked
thrice in a game in April.

2008
Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki needs 16 stitches to close up a gash in
his right palm caused by a maple bat when he pounds it into the ground in
frustration and it shatters. These types of bats are under scrunity of a
major league investigation because of their tendency to shatter when the
hard wood breaks instead of just cracking like the bats made from softer ash.

Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals hits his 300th career homerun,
a screaming line drive against the left field foul pole off the Chicago
Cubs at Busch Stadium. Also in the season, he records his 1,500th hit. He

with eight straight 100-RBI seasons, joining Hall of Famers Al Simmons and
Ted Williams.

2009
In his 4,145th big league at-bat, Adam Dunn hits his 300th career homerun
in Washington's 5-3 win over Atlanta at Nationals Park. The 29-year-old left
fielder is the fifth quickest player to reach the milestone only behind Babe
Ruth (3,830), Mark McGwire (3,837), Ralph Kiner (3,883) and Harmon Killebrew
(3,928).

2011
Shaun Marcum becomes the first Brewer pitcher to hit a grand slam for the
franchise since 1969 when Fred Talbot accomplished the feat in the inaugural
season of the Seattle Pilots, a year before the team moved to Milwaukee. The
29-year-old right-hander's first career round-tripper isn't enough to get
a victory when he earns a no-decision in the team's 8-6 loss to Arizona.

2015
Cincinnati rookie hurler Josh Smith ties a 108-year-old Reds record when
he plunks Aramis Ramirez, Jean Segura, Gerardo Parra and Carlos Gomez in

Livan Hernandez, who accomplished the dubious feat in 2005 against Colorado.

2017
Adrian Beltre of Texas recorded his 600th career double in the first inning
against the Boston Red Sox. He became the 17th player to reach this mark.

League history to hit 30 homeruns before the All-Star break, against the
San Diego Padres. Willie Mays accomplished this feat as well in 1954.
