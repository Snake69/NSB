Jul 6

1901
NL president Nick Young accedes to a protest regarding umpire Harry Colgan and
allows the Giants and Pirates to officiate their own game in Pittsburgh. New
York's Charlie Buelow and Pirate Jack O'Connor call the game, won by the
Bucs, 6-2.

1902
Corsicana of the Texas League wins its 27th game in a row, topping Charlotte's
record of 25 set earlier this year. Corsicana will finish the year with a
57-9 record.

1903
At West Side Grounds, Mathewson gives the Giants their 2nd win in three
games with Chicago, beating the Cubs, 5-1. Jock Menefee takes the loss.

1904
The Giants pound the Phillies, 12-3, as Mathewson wins his 15th. Again,
Matty is lifted after 6 innings, having given up no runs, and Red Ames
finishes. Chick Fraser takes the loss for Philadelphia.

1906
After winning yesterday, the Cubs (51-22) lose the 4th game of the series
with Pittsburgh, 3-2, in 10 innings. Jack Taylor pitches his first game
for Chicago.

The White Sox sign OF Patsy Dougherty. The former Highlander had been playing
with Lancaster (Tri State) after a salary dispute with New York. Dougherty
will be immediately suspended by the AL for jumping his contract, then pay
a $175 fine. He'll hit .233 for the Sox in 75 games.

1908
In Cincinnati, Christy Mathewson stops the Reds, 2-1, beating Andy Coakley
for a Giants win. He'll beat them again by the same score on the 9th. The
3rd place Giants are now 1 1/2 games behind the first-place Pirates. John
McGraw misses the game to scout 19-year-old prospect Rube Marquard, pitching
in Columbus.

1909
Red Sox rookie Larry Pape makes his debut with a 2-0 win over the Nationals.

1910
New York tops the Doves, 8-3, in 14 innings. Both starters go all the
way. Boston scores 3 runs in the 3rd off Christy Mathewson and the Giants
tie it in the 9th on a homerun by Beals Becker. New York finally unshoes
Buster Brown for 5 runs in the 14th to win.

1911
The Cards and Phils combine to hand out 23 walks, tying the record set last
year (May 4) by the Cards (16) and Reds (7). Today the St. Louis pitchers
walk 13, including a record 8 in the 3rd inning. St. Louis still wins,
13-9. Fred Luderus has a pair of homers.

With the score even at 10 apiece after 8 innings, the Reds score 2 in the
9th to edge host Boston, 12-11, as Johnny Kling and Patsy Doherty each hit
homers. Doherty is 4 for 6.

1912
In Brooklyn, the cornerstone is put in place and construction on Ebbets
Field begins.

At St. Louis, the Cubs lose to the Cards, 12-7, as Miller Huggins scores 5
runs. Heinie Zimmerman gets tossed out of the game for arguing with umpire
Rigler. He then has an obscene tantrum in front of the fans, enough to
"have grown men blush." It will cost him a $100 fine by the league.

1913
At St. Louis, the Senators push across 2 runs in the top of the 9th to
take a 3-2 lead. Walter Johnson, the 4th Washington pitcher, shuts out the
Browns in the 9th and is awarded the win. As reported in Sporting Life,
Prexy "Ban Johnson rules that when a pitcher leaves the box at the end of
an inning he shall not receive benefit of any runs made in the following
inning. He says all runs should aid the reliever, not the previous pitcher."

1914
At Washington, it is a battle of the Johnsons - Boston's Rankin vs. the Nats'
Walter. George McBride's steal of home in the 4th inning is the only score,
and Walter wins the 16th 1-0 game of his career.

The A's sell pitcher Boardwalk Brown, 17-13 last year, to the Yankees. New
York also brings back Birdie Cree by sending Bill Holden and cash to Baltimore
(IL) in exchange. Birdie hit .348 in 1911 and .332 the next season before
injuring his leg. He slumped to .272 last year and was sold to Baltimore,
but he will hit .309 in 77 games this year.

1917
In a 4-1 Detroit win, Ty Cobb's hit streak ends at 35 games as White Sox
pitchers Red Faber and Jim Scott hold him hitless. His streak began May
31. Cobb holds the AL mark of 40 straight games, set in 1912, but George
Sisler will ring up 41 games in 1922.

1918
After walking 7 batters, the Reds' Pete Schneider takes a 10-0 one-hitter
versus the Phils into the 9th, but walks the first 6 batters in the inning
to force in 3 runs. Two relievers later, the Phils have 9 runs, but lose
10-9. Pete's 13 walks is still a club record.

At Chicago, Hippo Vaughn pitches and bats the Cubs to a 1-0 12-inning victory
over the Giants. Hippo wastes an 11th inning double but his single in the
12th drives in the only run.

The Red Sox regain first place, beating the Indians, 5-4. Pinch hitter
Babe Ruth drives in two runs in the 6th inning with a triple and scores
the winning run when the relay is fumbled.

1919
At Cincinnati, the Reds take 2 from Pittsburgh to move into first place. The
Reds and Giants will seesaw back and forth until August 1st, when the Reds
gradually begin to pull away, sprinting at the end to a 9-game lead.

The NL rules that a team president can't serve as a manager at the same
time and William Veeck, former sportswriter, replaces Fred Mitchell as Cubs
president. Mitchell remains manager for Chicago.

1922
Red Sox owner Harry Frazee cancels today's doubleheader with the Browns
for no apparent reason. Browns VP Walter Fritsch, traveling with the team,
is furious and as quoted in the St. Louis Post Dispatch accuses Frazee of
doing this so that the Browns will have to play three doubleheaders in 3
days and thus aid the Yankees, a team the Browns play on July 11. The rules
will be changed at the winter meetings to put the decision to cancel games
in the hands of the umpires rather than the owners.

1920
After 3 straight losses to the Senators, the Yankees score 14 in the 5th
and submarine Washington 17-0. It's the biggest inning ever until the Red
Sox score 17 in a 1953 game. Ruth has an intentional pass and a two-run
single in the big inning, but the highlite is a Del Pratt liner that rolls
through a hole in the right field wall for a three-run homer. Ruth, under
orders from Huggins not to slide, ignores the mandate and slides into 3B
jamming his left wrist. Carl Mays is the easy winner over Olaf Erickson,
allowing just 3 hits. It is the first time this season that the Senators
have been shut out, and ties their club mark for the biggest shutout loss.

The White Sox top the Indians, 5-4, on Happy Felsch's homer in the 11th
off Jim Bagby.

The Red Sox split a pair with the A's, winning game 1, 11-0, behind Sam
Jones. Rollie Naylors is a 5-1 winner for the A's in the 2nd game, with
homerun support from Walker, Dykes and Welch. Gene Bailey, obtained from
the Braves in May, has 6 hits in the 2 games. He is the only man to play
for the Boston Braves and the Red Sox in the same season.

1925
Following yesterday's loss, the 7th-place Cubs install the fun-loving Rabbit
Maranville as manager, replacing Bill Killefer. The experiment will last
less than two months.

Radio broadcasting is prohibited from the parks of the American League. This
comes out when Chicago Daily News station WMAQ is denied permission to
broadcast from the White Sox park. "The club owners voted to prohibit
broadcasting presumably because they figured it would affect patronage." -
Cleveland Plain Dealer.

1926
The Reds beat the Cards, 5-2, in 11 innings to take a 5-game lead in the
NL. Wally Pipp's 2 run HR in the 10th, off Grover Alexander, ties the score
at 2 apiece.

The Reds purchase veteran SS Everett Scott from the White Sox.

The Tigers get solo homeruns from Fats Fothergill and Harry Heilmann,
but that is all the scoring as the Browns win, 5-2. George Sisler has an
inside-the-park homer when his grounder caroms off second baseman O'Rourke's
shoe into deep center.

1927
The Red Sox (17-56) drop another two at home to the A's, 5-1 and 7-5. In
the opener, Al Simmons and Jimmy Dykes pole homers, while Ty Cobb adds a
double and 2 singles. Cobb also steals home on the front end of a triple
steal that wins a big round of applause from the stands. Jack Quinn is the
winner. Dykes has 3 hits, including 2 doubles, in the nitecap to back Rube
Walberg's pitching.

The Tigers beat Ernie Nevers, 9-8, when the Brownie starter forces home
the winning run in the 8th inning. In the same frame, St. Louis loses its
$100,000 CF Fred Schulte when he bangs into the concrete wall fracturing
his left wrist and left rib.

The game between the Giants and the Robins is called off, officially because
of rain. With little or no rain, the real reason is lack of sunshine.

1928
Urban Shocker, in poor health, is released by the Yankees after one appearance
on the mound.

1929
After losing 11 in a row, including a 10-6 loss in the opener, the Cardinals
break out in the 2nd game. They score 10 in the first inning and 10 more in
the 5th to wallop the host Phils, 28-6, on 28 hits. The run and hit totals
are NL records for this century, and the 9 Cards scoring 2+ runs ties the
ML mark. The Cardinals (43) and Phillies (30) combine for a ML-tying 73
hits in the doubleheader at cozy Baker Bowl. Jim Bottomley was the major
Redbird contributor with a grand slam and 7 RBIs in the game to go with
his two homers in the opener. Chick Hafey also clouts a grand slam for
St. Louis. Taylor Douthit adds 5 hits and two walks while winning pitcher
Fred Frankhouse contributes another 4. The two teams combine for a NL record
5 players having 4+ hits in a 9-inning game. Claude Willoughby takes the loss.

After watching the Tigers belt 8 HRs on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, the Browns used
the off day yesterday to erect a screen in front of the RF pavilion. The
screen stretches 156 feet from the foul pole toward CF, 310 feet down the
line from home. This screen will remain in place into the 1950s, the only
stadium with extended OF seating where it is impossible to catch a homerun
ball. The screen has no effect today as the Yankees win, 3-1. Meusel has
a double for the only extra-base hit in the game.

1931
The Indians score 8 runs in the 6th inning enroute to a 13-4 win over the
Tigers. Pitcher Willis Hudlin walks twice in the frame, scoring each time.

1932
Following Lon Warneke's 6-1 win over the Phillies in Chicago, Cubs SS Bill
Jurges is shot twice in his room at the Carlos hotel, 2 blocks north of
Wrigley, by a spurned girlfriend, Violet Popovich Valli. In a scuffle for
the gun, Jurges is hit in the shoulder and hand. Jurges fails to prosecute,
and Valli will be signed to a 22-week contract to sing in local nightclubs
and theaters. She is billed as "Violet (I Did it for Love) Valli - the Most
Talked About Girl in Chicago."

1933
The first ML All-Star Game is played at Comiskey Park, and, appropriately,
Babe Ruth is the star, though he finished 6th in the voting. Al Simmons
and Chuck Klein were the top two vote-getters. Ruth strikes out against
Lon Warneke, but his 2-run HR is the margin of victory in the AL's 4-2
win. Lefty Gomez, the starter and winner, also knocks in the game's first
run. John McGraw comes out of retirement to manage the NL. The match draws
49,200 fans who pay $52,000.

1934
At St. Louis, Ernie Lombardi has 5 hits, including a triple and a homer,
and 6 RBIs to help the Reds nose out the Cards, 16-15. Leo Durocher makes
the last out of the game when he is thrown out at home plate. Rip Collins
scores 5 runs for the losers, just the 2nd time in history that has happened.

The Braves and Phils rack up 41 hits as Boston holds on for a 16-13
victory. Hal Lee has 4 hits and 3 homers for the Braves.

With Van Lingle Mungo on the mound the Dodgers whip the Giants, 11-2. Sam
Leslie hits a grand slam in the 6th.

The Red Sox triple the A's, winning 18-6. The Sox have 20 hits, 3 by winning
pitcher Wes Ferrell, who adds a stolen base. Billy Werber scores 5 runs.

The ML teams score 143 runs today with the NL scoring 83. The record for
the NL is 101 runs, set on May 17, 1887.

1935
The Senators win game 1, 8-3, then drop the nitecap in 11 innings, 10-7. In
the 11th inning, the Yankees' Tony Lazzeri swipes home. It is Tony's second
steal of home in extra frames, tying Hornsby and setting the AL record. In
the 1940s, Wally Moses will swipe home three times to set the ML record.

1936
After the first batter is thrown out trying to bunt, Bob Feller, a 17-year-old
farm boy from Van Meter, Iowa, strikes out 8 consecutive batters in three
innings during an All-Star break exhibition game against the Cardinals'
Gas House Gang. It is the Indian rookie's first appearance in a major
league uniform.

1938
At Crosley Field, Yankees hurler Lefty Gomez is defeated for the first time
in four All-Star starts and the NL wins the 6th All-Star Game, 4-1, with the
aid of fine pitching and 4 AL errors. Starter Johnny Vander Meer gets the
win before his hometown Cincinnati crowd with 3 shutout innings. In the 7th
Brooklyn's Leo Durocher (the first Dodger to start in an All-Star game) has a
"bunt homerun" when he lays down a sac bunt to move Frank McCormick. Third
sacker Jimmie Foxx fields it and throws it into RF. where it is retrieved
by Joe DiMaggio. Joe D throws wildly trying to nab McCormick, allowing Leo
to circle the bases.

1940
The Tigers sweep a pair from the Browns and move within 2 percentage points
of the Indians. In an 11-2 win, Bobo Newsom allows three hits in winning
his 12th straight - all complete games - as Detroit pounds Vern Kennedy
for 12 hits in 4+ innings. Detroit scores two unearned runs in the nitecap
to give young Johnny Gorsica the win over John Niggeling. Niggeling allows
just 4 hits.

At Chicago, Paul Derringer allows just one hit - Stan Hack's double in the
6th - as the Reds top the Cubs, 4-0. Frank McCormick's three-run homer in
the first is the big Red blow.

1941
A center field monument dedicated to Lou Gehrig is unveiled by the
Yankees. The memorial is a tribute by his teammates of their beloved captain
who died last month of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A crowd of
60,948 watch as the Yankees defeat the visiting A's, 8-4 and 3-1. DiMaggio
has 4 hits in the first game and 2 in the nitecap.

The Reds' Elmer Riddle (9-0) allows 3 hits in shutting out the Cardinals,

the Cardinals.

1942
First-inning HRs by Lou Boudreau and Rudy York off Mort Cooper lead the AL to
a 3-1 triumph over the NL in the All-Star Game at the Polo Grounds. Mickey
Owen's pinch HR is the NL's only score ... he does not hit a single HR
during the regular schedule. Johnny Vander Meer pitches 3 shutout innings
for the NL, striking out 4. The game, scheduled to start at 6:30 P.M. and
end promptly at 9:10, is delayed a half hour because of showers. The curfew
is reset to 9:30, just minutes after the game ends, and the post-game press
interviews are conducted in darkness. The game also features the first and
only starting sibling battery in All-Star history as losing pitcher Mort
Cooper throws to backstop Walker Cooper, his brother.

1944
At Fenway, Tex Hughson (13-3) benefits from 20 Red Sox hits to coast to
a 13-3 win over the Tigers. Every Sox batter collects a hit, led by Bobby
Doerr, the AL's 2nd leading batter, with 4 hits and 5 RBIs. Veteran Sox left
fielder Bob Johnson hits for the cycle and scores 4 runs before giving way
in the 7th to rookie Tom McBride.

On Mueller night in Cincy, 636 people named Mueller are guests of the
Reds and watch the Dodgers suffer their 10th straight loss, losing to the
Reds, 10-4. Bucky Walters wins his 14th while his batterymate Ray Mueller
establishes a NL record by catching in his 134th straight game. He'll finish
the season catching all 155 Reds games, as will Frankie Hayes of the A's. It
is the first time in the 20th century that catchers will play in all their
team's games. Deacon McGuire (1895 - Washington, 132 games) was the last
to do it (as noted by Chuck Rosciam). The loss goes to young Ralph Branca,
who combines with Clyde King to give up 13 hits - 4 to Gee Walker.

At Philadelphia, the first-place Browns top the A's 5-0, behind Bob Muncrief's
4-hitter. Vern Stephen's 3-run HR in the 1st is the big offensive blow. Woody
Wheaton, 1943 player-manager at Lancaster, takes the loss. Wheaton started
the season in the outfield.

1945
Despite homers by Pete Coscarart and Jim Russell to lead off the game against
Don Hendrickson, the Braves sweep the Pirates 13-5 and 14-8. For the winners,
Butch Nieman connects for a pinch grand slam in the opener. In the 2nd game,
Tommy Holmes hits in his 34th consecutive game to pass Rogers Hornsby's NL
record of 33 in 1922. The Braves' outfielder will extend the streak to 37
with the new mark lasting 33 years until broken by Pete Rose in 1987.

P Phil Marchildon rejoins the Athletics. In the Canadian Air Force, he was
shot down and held in a German prison camp for 9 months.

Mobile (Southern Association) catcher Harry Chozen, with a 33-game hitting
streak, is in the on deck circle when he is hit by an errant bat and knocked
unconscious. Chozen, who had walked his only time at-bat, leaves the game but
league Prexy Billy Evans rules that Chozen's hit streak is still intact. It
will eventually reach 49 games, breaking the Southern League record of 46
set by Johnny Bates in 1925. In the last 4 games of the streak, Chozen will
pinch hit, getting a hit each time.

1946
Cubs twirlers Johnny Schmitz and Hank Wyse each toss shutouts at the Reds,
as Chicago wins, 2-0 and 1-0. Joe Beggs loses to Schmitz in the 12-inning
opener when he gives up a 2-run pinch homer to Frank Secory. Harry Gumpert
is the hard-luck loser in the nitecap.

game earlier this year, Donnelly vowed to hit Birds manager Eddie Dyer
between the eyes with a ball if he lifted him again.

the Reds. St. Louis wins 3-0 and 2-0. Hearn allows 3 safeties and Dickson, 4.

1949
At Cincinnati, the Reds bang out 26 hits and roll over the Cubs,
23-4. Walker Cooper, acquired on June 13th from the Giants, collects a
20th-century record-tying 6 hits in 7 at-bats, including 3 homers, and
scores 5 times. Cooper ends the day with 10 RBIs. Ken Raffensberger wins
the laugher over Warren Hacker.

1951
At the Polo Grounds, the Braves smack 2 HRs (Willard Marshall and Walker
Cooper) in the top of the 3rd, only to have the Giants answer with 3 HRs -

outslug the Braves for the game, 12-10.

1952
Dodgers starter Ben Wade homers twice off Warren Spahn, in an 8-2 win over
the Braves in Boston. It is Brooklyn's 13th win in a row over the Braves.

In the 1st game of a doubleheader with the A's, Mickey Mantle and Gil
McDougald both double and homer off 14-game winner Bobby Shantz, as New
York wins 5-2. It's Mantle's 3rd homer of the season off Shantz. The A's
take the nitecap, 7-6, on Ferris Fain's double in the 9th.

1953
In his first major league start, Al Worthington blanks the Pirates, 6-0. The
Giants' rookie will repeat the feat in his next start blanking the Dodgers
to tie a major league mark.

In Philadelphia, the Yankees break out of their slump (4-11) by sweeping the
A's. New York wins the opener, 10-5, when Mantle follows walks to Martin,
Rizzuto and Johnny Sain with a pinch grand slam in the 6th. The ball clears
the roof in left-center field of Connie Mack Stadium (Shibe Park) and is
never found. Lefty Frank Fanovich serves up what proves to be Mickey's only
career pinch slam.

1954
Before any batters are retired, the Indians score 8 runs, a ML record, against
the Orioles. They'll tally 3 more in the inning and win, 11-3. Bill Glynn has

Wynn allows no hits through 7 innings before tiring, but earns his 10th win.

1955
In his first ML start, Sandy Koufax goes 4 1/3 innings against the Pirates
at Forbes Field. He gives up just three hits but walks 8 while fanning
4. He gets no decision as the Bus win, 4-1.

1956
Unlikely slugger Jim Busby of the Indians hits his 2nd grand slam in as
many days as the Tribe beats the A's 4-2. Busby is the first to slam in
consecutive games since Jimmie Foxx in 1940 and just the 5th this century.
Yesterday, in a 13-7 loss to Detroit, the Indians' outfielder hit his
bases-loaded homerun off winner Frank Lary in the first inning.

games without an error, a ML record, but his 226 mark will subsequently be
broken in the NL by Doug Dascenzo.

1966
Tying an American League record, Boog Powell knocks in 11 runs in a
doubleheader. In game one, the Oriole first baseman hits two homers,

more RBIs in the nightcap, but the Orioles lose, 9-8.

The Red Sox sweep a pair from the Yankees, 5-3 and 5-4, with reliever Don
McMahon picking up both wins. He pitches 1 2/3 innings in the opener and

victories. Yaz has an inside-the-park homerun off Jim Bouton.

an infield single in the 1st and a bloop double in the 9th.

Cub relief pitchers hold the Pirates hitless for 12 2/3 innings but it goes
for naught in a 5-4 20-inning loss. Cliff Johnson's 2-out homer in the 9th
off Blyleven ties it for Chicago, but Omar Moreno's RBI single in the 20th
is the game winner. Jim Bibby (11-1) takes the win with 3 scoreless innings
pitched, but loses a probable start in the All-Star game.

1983
In the 50th anniversary All-Star Game at Chicago's Comiskey Park (where
the first All-Star game was played), the AL routs the NL 13-3 for its
first win since 1971. The AL breaks the game open with 7 runs in the 4th
inning, highlighted by Fred Lynn's grand slam - the first ever in All-Star

staying in their seats.
