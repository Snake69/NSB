1901
Colts 1B Jack Doyle, harassed by a Polo Grounds fan, jumps into the stands and
hits him once with a left, reinjuring his hand, which he had broken several
weeks before. The Giants' "Dummy" Taylor trims Chicago's Jack Taylor, 6-4.

The Phillies hand the Pirates a 1-0 loss, for Pittsburgh's only shutout of
the year in 139 games. This is a 20th century NL record that will hold up.
The 1894 Boston and Philadelphia teams went through the 132-game season
without being shut out.

With Boston leading 5-2 over the Orioles in the 6th inning, the O's score 2
runs off starter George Cuppy, and he leaves with 2 runners on base. Reliever
Ted Lewis allows the runs to score, and Baltimore goes on to win 7-5. Lewis
is charged with the loss under the existing rules.

1902
Rube Waddell wins his first game for the Athletics, blanking Baltimore on 2
hits 2-0. He fans the side 3 times, once on 9 pitches in the 3rd, and faces
only 27 batters, as C Ossee Schreckengost throws out the 2 base runners. In
fanning the side in the 3rd, 6th and 9th, the 25-year-old southpaw strikes
out the same 3 men each time:  Billy Gilbert, Harry Howell and Jack Cronin.

1903
Cy Young drives in the contest's lone run (in the 10th inning) when he
blanks the Pale Hose at Chicago's South Side Park, 1-0. The shutout, his
fourth consecutive complete game without allowing a run, is the Boston
American right-hander's third 1-0 victory in a span of nine days.

1905
White Sox P Frank Owen narrowly misses becoming the first to pitch
a doubleheader shutout as the Browns score two runs off him in the 2
games. The Sox win 3-2 and 3-0.

1906
Righthander Jack Taylor, 8-9 with the St. Louis Cardinals, returns to
the Cubs in exchange for 2nd-string C Pete Noonan, rookie P Fred Beebe and
cash. New Chicago owner Murphy is not as apoplectic on the subject of Taylor
as his predecessor Hart, and the acquisition denies the Giants of Taylor's
services. Taylor will help the Cubs by going 12-3 the rest of the year. The
New York Telegram will accuse Reds owner Herrmann of syndicate baseball,
saying he put Murphy in as owner of the Cubs and is backing the St. Louis
Cards. Hence, the swap of Taylor from the Cards, Steinfeldt from the Reds and
Sheckard from Brooklyn - all in an effort to deny the Giants the pennant. The
Cubs win today, 1-0, over Bob Wicker and the Reds. Ed Reulbach is the winner.

1908
Jimmy Dygert of the A's shuts out the Senators, 2-0, as Washington concludes
a 30-game road trip, winning 8. Last year they played 31 straight on the
road, an AL record.

1910
The new White Sox Park opens, decorated with thousands of yards of
bunting. Five bands are on hand and the mayor presents a banner to Charles
Comiskey. The stadium, later called Comiskey Park, is baseball's biggest and
costs $750,000 to build. 24,900 attend the game, 1,100 less than capacity,
and see Sox ace Ed Walsh lose, 2-0, to the Browns. The new ballpark, to be
named after the owner, replaces the obsolete South Side Park, built in 1890
and the team's home since 1900.

1911
In a 3-0 Chicago win over the host Reds, Cubs player-manager Frank Chance
leaves the game suffering from a blood clot in the brain. Except for 11
brief appearances at 1B over the next 3 years, his playing days are over.

The A's pound Walter Johnson for 13 runs, the most he'll allow in his career,
and beat Washington, 13-8. Frank Baker hits his 2nd of five career homers
off Johnson in the 6th with a man on.

Ty Cobb, who had an infield single off Earl Hamilton in his last game, on
June 29th, repeats by beating out another infield hit against the St. Louis
lefty. Again, Detroit wins, this time 8-0.

1912
At Pittsburgh, Chicago's Wildfire Schulte breaks up a scoreless pitching duel
between Marty O'Toole and Jimmy Lavender by legging out an inside-the-park
homer in the 12th inning. Lavender and the Cubs win, 1-0.

1913
Rube Marquard coasts to a 10-0 Giant whipping of the Phillies. Alexander
takes his 2nd straight loss.

1914
Harry Kingman, son of the New York Congregationalist missionary and chaplain
at Pomona College, becomes the first person born in China to play in a major
league game. The 22-year-old Yankee first baseman from Tientsini, goes hitless
in his only three big league at-bats, but reaches first on a base on balls.

1915
Pittsburgh (FL) drops game 1, 6-0, at Baltimore, then scores in every inning
of the nitecap to win, 13-5 (as noted by Dave Vincent). This is the first
game since 1894 that this has happened.

1916
At age of 42 years 4 months, Honus Wagner is the oldest player to hit
an inside-the-park HR. He connects for the Pirates in the 4th inning at
Cincinnati as the Bucs win, 2-1.

Babe Ruth retires the first 10 Washington batters, but the next 5 reach base,
sending the Boston lefty to the showers and sending him to a 4-2 loss.

1917
Reds Fred Toney pitches a doubleheader, beating the Pirates 4-1 and 5-1,
both complete games. He walks one and allows 3 hits in each game, the fewest
hits allowed by any pitcher winning 2 games in one day.

Despite a state law banning Sunday baseball, the Robins (Dodgers) play
their first Sunday game in Brooklyn, charging regular admission and beating
the Phils 3-2. Charles Ebbets announces that the admission to benefit the
Militia of Mercy, a wartime charity, is for a pregame band concert and
military drill exhibition. When the band concert ends ticket sales stop to
conform with the Sunday baseball laws. More than 12,000 attend. However,
the maneuver does not fool the authorities. Ebbets and manager Wilbert
Robinson are arrested, and will pay a small fine.

1918
At Quincy, in the Bethlehem Steel League, Dutch Leonard loses to Eddie Plank,
6-2. It is Leonard's first game in the league.

1919
Going 5 for 5 in a 9-4 win over the Phils, Brooklyn's Ed Konetchy gets
his 10th straight hit tying Jake Gettman's ML record with Washington in
1897. Both will be topped by Walt Dropo in 1952.

At Boston, the Braves' Rabbit Maranville lines a 2nd inning inside-the-park
homer off the Philley's Eppa Rixey. Getting the hang off it, Rabbit reduxes
in the 4th inning off Rixey for another inside-the-park homer. The Braves
win 9-1 behind Al Demaree.

The Red Sox arrive in Philadelphia for a series with the A's, but an
arrest warrant stemming from the Memorial Day incident, prompts Carl Mays
to quickly leave by train for Boston.

1920
Walter Johnson pitches a no-hitter, his first, against the Red Sox at
Fenway. An error by Bucky Harris costs him a perfect game, but Harris'
hit drives in Washington's only run. Johnson strikes out 10 and gets 6 Red
Sox on foul flies. Tomorrow, Johnson comes up with a sore arm again and
is useless for the rest of the year, finishing 8-10. Harry Harper is the
loser against his old teammates.

The Yankees (45-23) beat the A's 9-5 to gain a tie for first place with the
Indians (43-22) by 2 percentage points. Ernie Shore is the winner despite
giving up 13 hits.

At Cincinnati, Chicago's Grover Cleveland Alexander allows 7 hits in shutting
out the first place Reds, 1-0, and beating Dolf Luque.

Leaving Robison Field in mid-season, the third-place Cardinals play their
first game at Sportsman's Park. Mayor Henry Kiel throws out the first ball,
and then 15,000 fans watch the Cards lose, 6-2, to the Pirates in ten
innings. Pittsburgh bunches four hits and a walk off Willie Sherdel to win
for Babe Adams. Sportsman's Park is also the home of the American League's
St. Louis Browns. After signing a ten-year lease for $20,000 annually with
Browns' president Phil Ball, the team moves six blocks to be able to play
its home games in a modern ballpark.

1921
Casey Stengel is traded from the last-place Phils to the 2nd-place Giants,
along with IF Johnny Rawlings and P Red Causey for IF Goldie Rapp and
outfielders Lance Richbourg and Lee King.

At Cincinnati, Pittsburgh's Johnny Morrison stops the Reds, 5-2. Eppa Rixey
is the starter and loser for the Reds. Pete Donohue, fresh from TCU, skips the
minors and makes his ML debut for the Reds in relief. He'll go 7-6 this year.

1923
In the opener of a Western League doubleheader, the first 4 batters for
Wichita hit homers, all off Karl Black. The sluggers include Lyman Smith,
Jocko Conlon, Wes Griffin and Jim Blakesley. Only Jocko will make it to
the majors.

1924
Braves player-manager Dave Bancroft ruptures his appendix. The future Hall
of Fame SS will not play again until September 10.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

1925
The Giants move back on top of the NL, taking 2 from the Phils. In the
2nd game, young Hack Wilson hits 2 HRs in the 3rd inning of the 16-7
rout. Hack totals 12 bases in the power outage (2 doubles in addition to
the 2 homers). Tomorrow, the Pirates edge back on top with a 2-1 win over
the Reds while New York is rained out.

1926
The Pirates break an 8-game losing streak by beating St. Louis, 7-3. They
move into 2nd, dropping the Cards to 3rd.

In the first of 2 at Yankee Stadium, Lou Gehrig's solo homer in the 6th,
off Walter Johnson, is the difference as the Yankees win, 3-2, over the
Senators. Urban Shocker takes the win. Washington comes back to win game
2, 12-5.

1927
Gehrig continues his slugging by clouting a double and his 26th homer as
the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 7-4. Earl Combs adds a leadoff 4-bagger,
off Danny MacFayden, to help send the Carrigan Troopers to their 13th loss
in a row. Despite being hit in the stomach by a line drive in the 3rd,
Herb Pennock picks up the win, with relief help from Bob Shawkey.

The Browns outslug the White Sox, 18 hits to 16, and win, 14-12. St. Louis
is led by George Sisler and Ken Williams, each with 4 hits, while Chicago
gets 2 doubles and a homer from Bibb Falk. Bert Cole, battered for 6 hits
in the Browns' 6-run 6th, takes the loss. Brownie starter Ernie Nevers
lasts just 3 innings, but is awarded the win.

1928
Before 65,000 fans, the Yanks sweep a pair from the visiting A's, 12-6 and
8-4. Tony Lazzeri wallops a pair of homers in the nitecap, and is 7 for
8 with 15 total bases on the day. Gehrig connects for a pair of homers in
the opener to back Hoyt's 10th win.

1931
At Philadelphia, Chuck Klein knocks in 5 runs as he hits for the cycle to
lead the Phils to an 11-6 win over the Cubs. The Phils pull off a triple
play, the first time that's happened in a game in which a player cycles.

1932
At Wrigley, Lon Warneke beats the Reds, 8-4, to become the NL's first
10-game winner. The Cubs edge back into first place. The Reds lose their
9th straight but they'll beat the Cubs tomorrow.

1934
Giants first baseman Bill Terry leads all vote-getters in All-Star balloting
with Babe Ruth of the Yankees getting the most votes for American League
outfielders.

At Crosley Field, the Cardinals outlast the Reds 8-6 in an 18-inning
first-game of a double bill in Cincinnati. Dizzy Dean and Tony Frietas duel
for 17 innings. Joe Medwick homers in the 17th, the first scoring since the
9th, but the Reds tie it up in the bottom of the inning. The Cards plate
2 runs in the 18th off Paul Derringer to win, though it takes a running
catch by Medwick with the bases full to finish the game.

1935
The Cubs play their first night game and find the hitting is easy as they
win 8-4 in Cincinnati behind Roy Henshaw. Billy Herman lights up Crosley
Field with two doubles, two triples and a single.

At Fenway, the Red Sox defeat the Senators, 8-3, behind Wes Ferrell's
3-hitter. In the first inning, Bill Werber collides with a photographer while
going after a foul ball, and the ball drops untouched (as noted by Dick
Thompson). The photographer was standing ten feet in (in foul territory)
from the wall/fence separating the playing field from the stands and was
changing bulbs in his camera. He was not watching the action. The umpires
decide not to call interference. The sequence of play, though, leads to
a run that would not have scored had Werber fielded the ball. The game
account states this was a rare and unusual event.

Yankees OF George Selkirk suggests a cinder path, 6 feet wide, be installed
in the outfield so a player knows when he is nearing the wall.

Ed Cole of Galveston throws the first perfect game in Texas League history,
beating Tulsa, 1-0. Cole will spend 7 seasons in the Texas League.

1936
Powel Crosley Jr exercises his 2-year option and buys a controlling interest
in the Cincinnati Reds.

Detroit collects 25 hits off 3 White Sox pitchers to win 21-7.

The Athletics send veteran pitcher Bill Dietrich to Washington for the
waiver price. He'll be there three weeks before the Senators waive him to
the White Sox on July 20.

1938
Dodgers C Babe Phelps fractures the thumb on his throwing hand for the 2nd
time this year, and he's replaced by Shea. The Giants win at Brooklyn, 3-1.

Bill Dickey drives in 7 of the Yankees' 8 runs, all off starter Harry Kelley,
to lead New York to an 8-0 shut out of the Senators. Bill's big blow is a
grand slam. The Yanks add an 8th run on a homer by Frank Crosetti.

1940
Detroit's Bobo Newsom wins his 11th victory in a row, 3-1, over the White
Sox. Rigney takes the loss.

1941
Despite the 95 degree weather, 52,832 are on hand at Yankee Stadium to watch
Joe DiMaggio lead a sweep of the Red Sox, 7-2 and 9-2. The 2nd game is called
on account of rain after 5 innings. DiMaggio has 2 hits in the first game,
off Mike Ryba, and one in the 2nd, off Jack Wilson, to tie Willie Keeler's
1897 ML batting streak of 44 games. Dimaggio needs the help of a difficult
decision by the official scorer in the second game. Red Sox third baseman
Jim Tabor makes a poor throw, but the 'Yankee Clipper' is given a hit by New
York World Telegram's Dan Daniel. The Yankees have 25 hits in the 2 games
but fail to add a HR among their 15 hits in the first game. This ends their
AL streak of 25 consecutive games with at least one HR. The previous record,
set by the Tigers in 1940, was 17 games and the Tigers will take back the
record in 1994. During the streak the Bombers have connected for 40 homers,
9 by DiMaggio.

The Cleveland Indians suspend OF Roy Weatherly for sulking. Manager
Peckinpaugh will keep Weatherly in his doghouse, benching him for an August
10th twinbill and leaving him in Cleveland when the Tribe makes a short
swing to St. Louis and Detroit after that.

1942
The 1st 7 batters in the first inning score for Cleveland and the Tribe
wins 7-2 over the host White Sox. Five hits, a walk and an error send Orval
Grove to a quick shower. His replacement, Jake Wade, gives up a RBI single
but only allows 2 hits the rest of the way. Al Smith is the winner. Smith
will win 10 games this year, as will Al Hollingsworth, the top number of
victories for a lefty in 1942.

1943
The Sporting News switches to a tabloid format from a standard metro
layout as a means of saving newsprint. "The Bible of Baseball", which
was established in 1886, became the dominant voice and major source of
information for serious fans of the national pastime.

1944
The Yankees make 4 errors in the 9th to wrest defeat from victory, losing
to the White Sox, 3-2. Hank Borowy takes the loss.

The Cards outhit the Dodgers, 18-4, to win, 8-3. Marty Marion starts a
triple play by snagging a popup with his back to the infield, wheeling and
throwing to Verban at 2B.

1945
The first of the superstars returns from the war. Hank Greenberg, gone
for 4 years, homers in his first game following his release from the Army
before 47,700 in a Sunday game at Briggs Stadium. Rudy York adds a 3-run
homer as the Tigers win the opener over the A's, 9-5. Without Greenberg,
Detroit takes the nitecap, 5-3, to lead the Yankees by 3 1/2 games with
Chicago and Boston following.

Led by Tommy Holmes, the Braves win twice to sweep the three-game set
with the 2nd place Cards, 6-3 and 8-7. Holmes is 7 for 10 in the series,
including 4 homers and a triple, and stretches his hit streak to 28 games.

1950
'Eddye' Ford's Yankee debut is less than impressive as he gives up five runs
on seven hits and walks six in 4 2/3 innings of relief against the Red Sox
at Fenway Park. The lefty will go on to become the winningest pitcher in
franchise history and will be better known as Whitey. Boston rolls today,
13-4. Tommy Byrne takes the loss for the Yankees. Rookie Walt Dropo hits
a grand slam for the Bosox to dump the Yanks into 3rd place.

Behind unbeaten rookie Bob Miller, the first-place Phils trip the Dodgers,
6-4. Jim Konstanty makes his 30th relief appearance to help Miller win
his 7th straight. Mike Goliat and Willie Jones homer to pace an 11-hit
attack. By winning their second straight game from Brooklyn, the Whiz Kids
move .002 ahead of St. Louis and a game and a half ahead of Brooklyn.

The Reds' Ewell Blackwell has to go ten innings but finally beats the Cubs,
5-3, striking out 14 and allowing just two hits. One of the hits is Andy
Pafko's 3-run homerun in the 9th.

1951
Veteran Bob Feller pitches the 3rd no-hitter of his career, tying the
record of Cy Young and Larry Corcoran, as he beats Detroit's Bob Cain, 2-1,
in the first game of a DH. Feller loses his shutout in the 4th when Johnny
Lipon reaches on an error, swipes 2B, goes to 3B on an errant pickoff, and
scores on a fly. Rookie Bob Chakales shuts out the Tigers in the nightcap,
2-0, for Cleveland's 10th straight win over Detroit. Detroit has scored 8
runs in the ten losses.

Philadelphia's Russ Meyer and Jim Konstanty hold Brooklyn to one hit but
lose anyway, 2-0. Pee Wee Reese's 2-run triple follows 2 walks in the 3rd
and accounts for all the hits and runs.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, the Browns' Ned Garver, enroute to a
20-win season, limits the White Sox to 2 hits, winning, 3-1. The loss drops
the Sox out of the AL lead. Chicago wins the opener, 2-1, in 11 innings on
Minoso's 400-foot homer to left center. Minnie's blow breaks up a pitching
duel between loser Duane Pillette and Ken Holcombe.

Before 58,815 at Yankee Stadium, the Yanks top the Red Sox, 5-2, behind
Eddie Lopat's 6-hitter. The win moves the Yankees ahead of the White Sox
by 4 percentage points. Jerry Coleman homers off Mel Parnell, while Johnny
Pesky connects for the Sox. Bobby Doerr singles for his 2,000th career hit.

Elmer Valo belts three homers to help the A's sweep the Senators, 10-7 and
3-2. Two of his homers come in the first game, when teammate Gus Zernial
hits his 18th homer. Irv Noren has a pair of doubles and a homer for the Nats.

1952
At bat in the 1st inning in Boston, Braves Earl Torgeson's back swing hits
Giants C Sal Yvars on the shin guard. After an exchange of pleasantries,
Torgeson singles and is on base when Yvars breaks Torgeson's bat. After
the side is retired, Torgeson then goes into the Giants' dugout after
Yvars. Torgy is ejected after punching the catcher in the face, and Vern
Bickford, yesterday's winner, joins him for yelling at the umpire that
Yvars ought to be thumbed as well. The Giants then win 6-3. Torgeson and
Yvars will mix it up again on July 18, 1954.

The Indians' Larry Doby walks 5 times in a 19-inning 4-3 win at St. Louis. The
Tribe answers the Browns' score in the 19th with 2 runs, but they lose SS
Ray Boone when he suffers torn ligaments in his right knee covering 2nd
base on a pickoff attempt. Brissie wins his first, beating Paige (6-3),
who walks 9 in 11 innings.

1953
Mel Parnell wins his 100th career game as Boston blanks the Bronx Bombers at
Yankee Stadium, 4-0. Joining Cy Young, Joe Wood, Lefty Grove and Joe Dobson,
the southpaw from New Orleans becomes the fifth Red Sox hurler in franchise
history to reach the milestone.

The Red Sox send P Marv Grissom to the Giants for cash. Grissom will win
10 games in 1954 and stay with the Giants for 5 years. He will also team
up in 1954 with his nephew Jim Davis, the first time this has happened.

1954
Joe Cunningham of the Cards hits 2 HRs against Milwaukee giving him 3 for his
first 2 days in the ML, a record unequaled since. In his 1st seven at-bats,
he has 9 RBI. Cardinal ace Harvey Haddix (13-4) stops a Joe Adcock liner
with his knee, but wins 9-2. Haddix never fully recovers during the season
from this injury. Stan Musial chips in with 2 HRs, his 25th and 26th.

The first-place Giants beat the Dodgers, 5-2, to complete a 3-game sweep and
move 4 games ahead of the Brooks. Dusty Rhodes, who won the opening game
of the series with a pinch hit, drives in 2 today with a pinch single in
the 8th. The Dodgers had tied in the 7th on back-to-back HRs by Campanella
and Furillo.

Yankee infielder Bobby Brown retires at age 29 to pursue his medical
degree. Brown will later be president of the AL.

1955
At Wrigley Field, Hank Sauer, Ransom Jackson and Gene Baker all homer in
the 2nd inning against the Cardinals. Ernie Banks adds another later to
help Chicago win, 11-7.

At Cleveland, Early Wynn hurls his 3rd straight shutout, handing the White
Sox their 6th straight defeat, 1-0. Billy Pierce takes the loss. Wynn has
now thrown 29 straight scoreless innings, but will give up a 1st inning HR
on July 5 to Joe DeMaestri.

1956
Mickey Mantle, who failed to hit a homer in 11 games since June 20,
switch-hits HRs in the same game for the 4th time in his career. The Yankees
win, 8-6, over Washington in the 2nd game for a doubleheader sweep. The 2nd
homer, off Bud Byerly, is a 2-run shot in the 9th inning to win it. Pedro
Ramos holds the Bombers to 3 hits in the opener, but one is a 2-run HR by
Joe Collins in the 8th that wins it for New York, 3-2. The Nats rap Ford
for 12 hits, but he picks 2 runners off base and is helped by 4 DPs.

The Cardinals use all 12 pitchers but they still drop a doubleheader to
the Reds, 19-15 and 7-1. In the 10-inning first-game, which lasts 3 hours
47 minutes, 43 hits are tallied, including 8 homers. Reds slugger Ted
Kluszewski accounts for 3 of the homers.

Before a PCL game at Lane Field in San Diego, Rocky Colavito takes aim at
Don Grate's throwing record of 443+ feet. Rocky tops out on a throw over
the CF fence at 435 feet 10 inches. Grate will improve his mark to 445 feet
1 inch on Fan Appreciation Night in Minneapolis. He'll take 6 steps before
each throw (as noted by historian Bill O'Neal).

1957
Cincinnati fans threaten to sue Commissioner Ford Frick unless Bell, Crowe
and Post are restored to the All-Star team.

With 45,276 on hand in Baltimore for "George Kell Night," the O's tie the
Yankees, 2-2, in the 9th when Billy Goodman singles in a run against Whitey
Ford. In the 10th, Mantle greets the new "Z" battery (the first in history) of
P George Zuverink and teen catcher Frank Zupo with his 22nd homer of the year
to give Ford his first win since April. The Z-duo will team up one more time.

1958
The Cubs' Tony Taylor hits a ball inside the 3B line that falls into the
rain gutter in fair territory at Wrigley Field. San Francisco rookie OF
Leon Wagner chases the ball, but is fooled by Cubs relief pitchers staring
intently under the bench. Wagner neglects to look for the ball in the gutter
40 to 50 feet further down. Taylor reaches home with the inside-the-park
drive to help the Cubs win 9-5.

The Orioles and Yankees split, the O's winning the opener, 7-5, and New
York taking the nitecap, 2-1. Mantle has a homer in each game, including
the game-two winner with 2 out in the 8th inning off Jack Harshman.

1959
The Reds purchase veteran 3B Willie Jones from the Indians.

1960
H. Gabriel Murphy's option of first-refusal to buy the Senators from current
owner Calvin Griffith expires. The chief minority stockholder, in an effort
to stop the club from moving to the Minneapolis/St. Paul area to become
the Twins, will lose two court decisions preventing him from keeping the
team in Washington, D.C.

Cards reliever Ernie Broglio is nothing but efficient, tossing a total of
2 1/3 innings of relief in two games with the Braves. Ernie wins both. The
Cards blow a 7-0 lead in the opener before winning in the 10th, 8-7. They
blow a 5-0 lead in the nitecap, but win 7-5. Fellow reliever Lindy McDaniel
gets rapped in both games.

1961
The Senators stake rookie Carl Mathias to a 3-0 lead over New York,
but a Mantle solo shot, a few feet left of the 456-foot sign in left at
Yankee Stadium, puts New York on the board. The Nats up the score to 5-1,
but Mantle then bangs a 3-run homer to make it 5-4 and knock out Mathias
(who in his 11 ML games will give up 3 homers to Mantle). In the 9th,
Maris poles a 2-run homer, his 28th, to give New York a 7-6 victory.

At Milwaukee, Gordy Coleman collects 8 hits and leads the Reds to a sweep
over the Braves. The Reds win the opener, 8-5, as Coleman collects 5 hits,
including a 3-run homer in the 13th off Warren Spahn. Gordy chips in with
3 more hits in the nitecap, a 4-3 Reds win.

1962
Albie Pearson becomes the first player to go hitless in 11 at-bats in a
doubleheader (both 9-inning games). Los Angeles splits with the Yankees,
losing 6-3 before winning 12-5. Reliever Art Fowler helps himself to a win
in the nitecap by driving in 4 runs on a pair of singles. The Yanks take
over 1st place.

The White Sox drop Cleveland to 3rd place while sweeping a doubleheader,
5-4 and 7-6. In the 2nd game they also set a ML record with 3 run-scoring
sacrifice flies (by Juan Pizarro, Nellie Fox and Al Smith) in the 5th
inning when they score 6 runs. Indian RF Gene Green makes the first put
out of the 6th inning, but then muffs two other fly balls, both of which
are credited as sacrifice flies, the scorer assuming the runners on 3rd
could have scored anyway.

1963
The Reds send C Jesse Gonder and cash to the Mets for 3B Charlie Neal and
C Sammy Taylor. Cincinnati also sells 2B Don Blasingame to Washington.

1964
Five thousand cabbies and their families are on hand at Yankee Stadium to
celebrate 'Taxi Day' at the Bronx ballpark. Billy Bryan's 11th inning solo
homerun is the decisive blow in Kansas City's 5-4 Wednesday afternoon victory.

At Crosley Field, the Reds score 4 runs in the bottom of the 9th to tie
the Cubs, 5-5. Pete Rose ends the game with a 10th-inning homer.

1966
At Washington, Mantle homers in the first inning off Phil Ortega as New
York edges the Senators, 8-6. Mick scores another run when Joe Pepitone
cracks a 2-run homer.

1967
The Orioles lose to Cleveland, 6-0. John O'Donoghue wins in relief. Mike
Adamson makes his ML debut for Baltimore. He is the first draftee to bypass
the minors and go straight to the majors, though he'll make it to the minors
next year.

Baltimore's Jim Palmer gives up a grand slam - but it's in the minors. Sent
to Rochester (International League) to rehabilitate from back problems,
Rochester manager Earl Weaver starts the 21-year-old against Buffalo, in a
game moved to Niagara Falls because of racial disturbances on Buffalo's east
side. Palmer is given a 7-0 lead, but the Bisons score 5 runs in the 3rd, four
coming home on a grand slam by Johnny Bench. Rochester hangs on to win, 10-8.

1968
A first inning wild pitch that eludes backup catcher Johnny Edwards allows a
run to break Bob Gibson's streak of 47 2/3 innings of scoreless pitching (in
which he allows just 21 hits) The Cards beat Don Drysdale and the Dodgers in
Los Angeles, 8-1. Gibson will pitch 23 innings before giving up another run.

1970
The return of Denny McLain following his suspension is witnessed by a
gathering of 53,863 fans and 71 writers. Trailing 5-3, he is knocked out
of the box in the 6th inning, but the Tigers rally to beat the Yankees in
the 11th, 6-5.

The Cards trade Ted Abernathy, acquired May 29, to the Royals for P Chris
Zachary. Abernathy will go 9-3 the rest of the year for KC.

The Angels' Greg Garrett picks up a win without throwing a pitch. Garrett
relieves with 2 outs in the 6th with the Angels trailing the Brewers,
2-1. He promptly picks off Tommy Harper to end the inning, then watches
as the Angels score 3 runs in the top of the 7th to take a 4-2 lead. Jack
Fisher pitches the last 3 innings to preserve Garrett's victory. Garrett's
win is similar to teammate Steve Kealey's win on June 26.

The Reds top the Braves, 9-2, as Tommy Helms becomes the first Red player
to go deep at Riverfront Stadium. Helms' homer, which hits the LF pole just
above the wall, is his only homer of the year.

1971
The Mets release 2B Al Weis, a WS hero less than 2 years earlier.

1972
Nolan Ryan allows 5 hits and strikes out 16 in pitching the Angels to a 5-3
victory over the Athletics. Ryan has an RBI single and is helped by homers
from Berry and Cardenas, off Steve Hamilton.

1973
The Reds, 11 games behind the Dodgers at the beginning of the day, stage two
dramatic comebacks to snatch a doubleheader win from LA. Hal King's clutch
3-run pinch-hit HR with 2 outs in the bottom of the 9th wins the first game,
4-3, against Don Sutton, while Tony Perez' 10th-inning hit wins the 2nd,
3-2. This day will be looked upon as the turning point of the National
League's Western Division race.

At Wrigley Field, the Mets edge the Cubs, 6-5, in the 1st game of a
doubleheader. Then its the Cubs' turn, as Randy Hundley bangs a 9th-inning
3-run homer to give Chicago the 6-5 edge. Ron Santo has 7 hits for the
afternoon, five in the nitecap

Luis Aparicio of the Red Sox steals the 500th base of his career in a 9-5
loss to Milwaukee. It is the highest total in the AL since Eddie Collins
retired in 1930.

At California, the Twins' Jim Kaat fires a one-hitter to beat the Angels,
2-1. Frank Robinson's HR in the 2nd is the only hit. This is the 2nd time
in his career that Robby hits a HR to break up a no hitter. He also did it
July 30, 1971 against KC's Dick Drago.

1975
The Reds win the 4th extra-inning game in 5 days, beating the Astros 8-7 in
15 innings. The Reds score 3 in the 9th to tie it at 7 apiece. Pat Darcy is
the winner. It is the second consecutive game that the Reds trail by 4 runs
and comeback to win ... no NL team will match that the rest of the century.

1976
The Indians paste the Toledo Mud Hens, 13-1, in an exhibition game in
Toledo. Manager Frank Robinson, hitting as the DH, flies out to CF and,

Reynolds. Suddenly, Robby flattens Reynolds with a right-left combination
and is quickly ejected from the game.

1978
The Astros trade C Joe Ferguson to the Dodgers for 2 players to be named
later (IF Rafael Landestoy and OF Jeff Leonard).

1979
New York hits 5 homers off Red Sox starter Dennis Eckersley to win,
6-5. Boston also loses speedster Jerry Remy, batting .304 on the season,
when he injures a knee sliding home. Remy will appear in only 7 more games
all year. Remy will never swipe more than 16 bases again, after averaging
35 steals his first 4 seasons.

Paul Molitor hits a leadoff HR - his 2nd in two days - as the Brewers roll
by the Mariners, 10-3. Gorman Thomas hits his 2nd HR in 2 days and Robin
Yount adds a 3-run dinger. Jim Slaton goes the distance for the win.

1982
Considered a questionable decision at the time because of his height,
Cal Ripken is moved from third base to shortstop by Oriole manager Earl
Weaver. The 6'4" future Hall of Famer takes over the job from veteran
infielder Mark Belanger, an eight-time Gold Glover at the position.

1983
Arbitrator Raymond Goetz rules that the 43 players who were on the Disabled
List during the 1981 players' strike are not entitled to their salaries
for that period. The decision saves the club owners about $2.5 million.

1984
Paul Splittorff announces his retirement from baseball. The 37-year-old
southpaw, who will be an analyst on pregame and postgame shows for KMBZ radio,
leaves the Royals as the all-time leader in victories/losses (166/144),
innings (2,554 2/3) and games started (392).

Minnesota's Frank Viola stops the Tigers, 9-0 on 4 hits in front of 53,484
at Detroit. Kent Hrbek has three hits, including a homer, and 4 RBIs.

1990
As Comiskey Park celebrates its 80th birthday, Yankee hurler Andy Hawkins
throws the season's 6th no-hitter (and the third in less than 48 hours),
but still loses, 4-0, to the White Sox. With 2 out in the bottom of the 8th,
New York's Mike Blowers misplays Sosa's routine grounder for an error, and
Hawkins walks 2 to load the bases. Outfielders Jim Leyritz and Jesse Barfield
drop back-to-back fly balls to allow all 4 runs to score. Barfield loses
Ivan Calderon's fly ball in the sun and the ball bounces off his mitt. Ken
Johnson in 1964 was the last pitcher to lose a no-hitter. Hawkins is not
credited with an official no-hitter because the home team doesn't need to
bat in the bottom of the ninth.

1992
White Sox SS Craig Grebeck gets 5 hits in Chicago's 8-5 win over the
Indians. Bobby Thigpen saves it for Kirk McCaskill, the winner over Jack
Armstrong (2-10).

1994
During a 14-7 Orioles rout of the Angels, the teams tie a major league
record slugging 11 homeruns during the Camden Yards contest. O's starter
Mike Mussina gives up all of the Halos round-trippers to tie Jim Palmer's
club record of giving up 5 in a game. Jeffrey Hammonds hits 2 homers for
Baltimore. It is the 8th 11-HR game in history. Surprisingly, none of the
homers go as far as 400 feet.

1996
At Yankee Stadium, the Key outguns the Rocket, as Jimmy Key beats Roger
Clemens, 2-0. Mike Aldrete's solo HR in the 7th is the first score.

In San Francisco, Barry Bonds and Mark Carreon homer to lead the Giants
to a 9-6 win over the Rockies. The win snaps a 10-game losing streak, the
longest for the Giants since a 10-game skein in 1985 and a 13-game losing
streak in 1944.

In a 4-1 win over Chicago, Pirate RF Orlando Merced pulls off an unassisted
DP, catching Mark Grace's liner and loping to 1B.

1997
Detroit's Bobby Higginson homers in the first inning against the New York
Mets, tying a major league record by homering in 4 consecutive at-bats over
2 games. Higginson, who struck out looking in his next at-bat, becomes the
23rd player since 1900 to accomplish the feat and the fourth Tiger.

After hitting a bouncer down the Astrodome's first base line, Tim Bogar
comes all the way around to score when Manny Ramirez doesn't play the ball
after it comes to a stop under the bullpen bench. The Indians outfielder,
unaware of the park's ground rules, begins signaling to the umpire that the
ball is out of play as the Astros' infielder circles the bases for an easy
inside-the-park homerun.

1998
Trailing the Mets, 8-7, in the bottom of the 8th inning, Toronto comes up
with 8 runs. New York fights back with 2 in their half of the 9th, but the
Blue Jays hold on for a 15-10 triumph.

During Houston's 10-4 win over the White Sox, a wild pitch bounces into
the pocket of home plate umpire Gerry Davis, allowing Chicago's Ray Durham
to score while Astros catcher Brad Ausmus scurries around the plate trying
to find the ball. Says Ausmus:  "I asked (Davis) if I was supposed to pick
him up and throw him in front of the runner." (San Angelo Standard) Shaun
Berry is 4 for 4 including a homer, while teammate Jeff Bagwell has a HR
and scores 3 times.

1999
The Brewers defeat the Cubs, 19-12, as SS Jose Valentin hits 2-run HRs from
each side of the plate. 2B Ron Belliard and C Dave Nilsson each get 4 hits
for Milwaukee, while Belliard drives home 5 runs. The Brewers light up Steve
Trachsel for 10 runs in 3 2/3 innings pitched, hanging his NL high 11th loss
on him. The Brew Crew collects 21 hits for the 2nd time in 3 nights. There are
8 homers in the game, including a pair by Cubs Mickey Morandini. Not homering
after 4 straight games in which he went deep is Sosa, who singles twice.

In Toronto's 8-6 win over Baltimore, Blue Jays P John Frascatore ties a
major league mark with his 3rd win in 3 consecutive appearances in 3 days.

Tom Glavine wins his 13th straight game over the Expos, 4-1, a streak that
stretches back to 1994. He takes no chances with the Braves bullpen, which
had blown 2 leads in the last 2 games, pitching a complete game. Curiously,
before his winning streak, Glavine was 3-13 against the Expos.

2000
Whitey Herzog, the winningest manager in franchise history, and Willie
Wilson, an speedy outfielder who was an offensive spark plug, become members
of the Kansas City Royals' Hall of Fame.

BARK, Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps debuts at Pac Bell. Six Portuguese
water dogs will be used to retrieve Splashdown homeruns hit by the Giants
and their opponents which land in McCovey's Cove.

On Canada's 133rd birthday, Florida's Ryan Dempster and Montreal's Mike
Johnson hook up in a rare matchup of Canadian starters. Dempster comes out
on top as the Marlins defeat the Expos by a score of 6-5. Johnson hails
from Edmonton, Alberta, while Dempster is a native of Sechelt, British
Columbia. Theirs is the first matchup of Canadian-born starters since last
September when Dempster took on Eric Gagne of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

2001
The Orioles defeat the White Sox, 11-3, on Cal Ripken Day. Ripken gets 3
hits in the Baltimore cause.

The Giants clip the Cardinals, 5-4, on Barry Bonds Day. Barry has a double
and 3 walks as Calvin Murray provides the scoring with a 3-run HR. McGwire
is 0 for 4 and is now 0 for his last 22 at-bats.

2002
Los Angeles' Eric Gagne picked up his 30th save in a 4-0 win over Arizona,
reaching that mark in the Dodgers' 82nd game - a major league record. The
previous mark was 83 games by Bobby Thigpen with the Chicago White Sox in
1990 and Lee Smith with St. Louis in 1993.

2003
After spending a disappointing season and a half in New York, Roberto Alomar
is traded by the Mets with cash to the White Sox for prospect Andrew Salvo,
right-hander Edwin Almonte and southpaw Royce Ring. The 12-time Gold Glove
second baseman's funk continues in the American League when the former
All-Star infielder hits just .253 with Chicago. Just a few hours after
obtaining Roberto Alomar from the Mets, the White Sox acquire outfielder
Carl Everett (.274, 18, 51) from the Rangers. Texas will pick two or three
players from a Chicago minor league pool, and the team will also give money
to help pay part of the former outfielder's $9.15 million deal.

The Marlins set a franchise mark for runs scored and tie a team record with
25 hits, with Miguel Cabrera, Ivan Rodriguez and Luis Castillo collecting
four each. The celebration of the 20-1 victory over the Braves is tempered
when a photographer is injured and is airlifted to a hospital as a result
of being hit by Darren Bragg's bat which slips from the outfielder's hand
and flies into the stands.

The Rockies end the Diamondbacks' franchise-record 12-game winning streak
with a 7-4 win over Arizona.

2005
After walking 2,100 miles from Camp Verde, Arizona to reach Wrigley
Field, Bill Holden throws the ceremonial first pitch and leads the crowd
singing Take Me Out to the Ballgame during the seventh-inning stretch at
the Nationals-Cubs game. Inspired by the DVD, This Old Cub, a documentary
about former Chicago All-Star third baseman Ron Santo, who lost both his
legs to diabetes, the 56-year-old school teacher, with two bad knees,
pounded the pavement for 172 days and raised $250,000 with his 'Walk the
Walk' campaign for juvenile diabetes research.

Led by Reed Johnson, who did not even start the game, the Blue Jays roll
to a 15-2 victory over the Red Sox. Johnson comes in as a pinch hitter for
Frank Catalanotto in the 6th and hits a grand slam, then follows with a
two-run single in the 7th. Ted Lilly is the winning pitcher.

The Twins down the last-place Devil Rays, 7-4, when Jacque Jones hits a
3-run triple in the 4-run 8th inning. The win goes to Jesse Crain (8-0)
in relief of Johan Santana. The Canadian born Crain gives up a 2-run HR
to Jorge Cantu but gets the win. Coupled with his 3-0 record last year,
he sets a mark for most consecutive relief wins (11) to start a career.

The Yankees send veteran Paul Quantrill to the Padres for pitchers Darrell
May and Tim Redding, and cash.

2006
The Orioles down the Braves, 7-4. Baltimore's Miguel Tejada plays in his
1,000th consecutive game, the longest active streak in the ML.

The Red Sox hook the Marlins, 11-5, as David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez each
hit two homers and drive in nine of the 11 runs. Mike Lowell has three
doubles. The Sox make two errors, however, ending their ML record streak
of 17 straight games without an error. They will have 108 games without
errors for the season, a ML mark, and field .9891, also a record.

2008
In the shortest nine-inning game in the history of Coors Field, Aaron Cook
throws only 79 pitches in the one-hour 58-minute contest. The right-hander's
five-hitter snaps the Rockies' eight-game losing streak with the 4-0 victory
over the visiting Padres.

2009
One day after succumbing to the greatest comeback in Orioles' history,
the Red Sox stage an improbable rally of their own. Boston uses a 4-run
9th inning to pull even. Julio Lugo singles in the tie-breaking run in the
11th inning and Jonathan Papelbon becomes the team's career saves leader
by closing out a 6-5 victory over Baltimore.

One run was enough for a victory for three NL teams, the first time in 33
years there were three 1-0 games in one league on the same day. The Mets,
Dodgers and Reds come away with 1-0 victories. The last time there were
three 1-0 games in one league was September 1, 1976 in the NL.

Hanlet Ramirez extends his RBI streak to 10 games in the Florida Marlins'
5-3 victory over the Washington Nationals. Ramirez hit a 2-run double in
the third inning to become the first SS in NL history with an RBI streak
of double-digit games.

2010
The first-place Rangers acquire catcher Bengie Molina and cash from the Giants
for reliever Chris Ray and minor league right-hander, Michael Main. Texas'
acquisition of the veteran backstop fills the void created by the off-season
loss of Pudge Rodriguez to Washington and the inconsistent play of Jarrod
Saltalamacchia.

On an interim basis, Kirk Gibson, the team's bench coach, is promoted to be
the manager of the Diamondbacks replacing A.J. Hinch, who piloted the team
to an 89-123 record in a little more than a full season in the dugout. In
addition to letting go their manager, the last-place team also fires general
manager Josh Byrnes.

2011
In the seventh inning of a 5-0 interleague victory over the Angels in Anaheim,
Dee Gordon steals second and third base and then completes the stolen base
cycle by swiping home. The Dodger shortstop becomes the 40th major leaguer
to accomplish the trifecta in the same frame.

Atlanta's Jair Jurrjens throws a 1-hitter in his first career shutout
and becomes the first NL pitcher with 11 wins with a 4-0 victory over
Baltimore. Adam Jones ends Jurrjens' no-hit bid with a single up the middle
with one out in the 7th.

2013
Prior to the game at Citi Field, the Mets and Diamondbacks honor the 19
firefighters killed while battling a wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona with a
moment of silence. Additionally, each team hangs a jersey with the word
Yarnell stitched on the back above the number 19 in their respective dugouts.

2014
Rick Porcello becomes the fourth pitcher in Tiger history, and the first
since Dizzy Trout in 1944, to throw a shutout without issuing a walk or
recording a strikeout when he blanks Oakland, 3-0. The Detroit right-hander,
who records 17 groundball outs and 10 in the air in his 95-pitch outing,
is the first major league hurler to accomplish the rare feat since Jeff
Ballard's performance for Baltimore on August 21, 1989.
