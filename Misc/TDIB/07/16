1901
In Cleveland, Boston's Cy Young notches his 12th straight win, staggering
to a 10-8 victory over the Blues. Buck Freeman has 3 hits including a triple
off losing pitcher Moore.

1902
At Cincinnati's Palace of the Fans, John McGraw begins his 30-year tenure
as manager of the New York Giants. 'Little Napoleon', the team's third
skipper of the season, loses his debut to the Reds, 7-2.

Giants owner Andrew Freedman announces he has purchased controlling
interest in the Baltimore club and releases Dan McGann, Roger Bresnahan,
Joe McGinnity and Jack Cronin to sign with New York. Mike Donlin, Joe Kelley
and Cy Seymour go to the Reds, where Kelley will take over as manager.

1903
Roger Bresnahan, playing center field for the Giants, starts a triple play
against the Pirates with the bases loaded. The future Hall of Fame catcher
snags a line drive and his throw to home holds the runner at 3B. Catcher
John Warner throws to 2B to get the runner advancing and the return home
nabs the runner from 3rd. But Pittsburgh gets two inside-the-park homers
from Ginger Beaumont, who scores five runs, and wins easily, 16-4.

The Boston Americans score 7 runs in the first inning, four coming after
a 3rd out is disallowed because the umpire had turned to the bench to ask
for new baseballs. Boston rolls to an 11-4 win over Cleveland.

1904
At New York, Highlander P Jack Chesbro swipes home in the bottom of the
10th to win his own game, 9-8.

1905
The Pirates edge the Giants, 2-1, overcoming the pitching of Christy
Mathewson, who is knocked over by Fred Clarke in a play at 1B. Six Giants
are tossed out of the coaching box during the game. Pittsburgh now trails
New York by 6 games.

1906
At New York, the White Sox score 3 in the 10th to beat the Highlanders,
7-4. Yesterday, they won with 2 runs in the 9th.

1907
Ed Walsh sets another ML record for fielding chances for pitchers, handling
12 assists and 3 putouts in a 13-inning 3-2 White Sox win over visiting
New York. His 12 assists (extra innings) will be matched by Nick Altrock
in 1908 and Leon Cadore in 1920.

1908
At Chicago, manager Frank Chicago figures to rattle Giants rookie Otis
"Doc" Crandall and elects to bat the Cubs first (this option rule for the
home team was changed in 1950). But Crandall is a rock and nurses a 4-1
lead into the last of the 9th. After one out, Christy Mathewson, warming in
the bullpen, decides the game is well in hand and goes into the clubhouse
to shower. Crandall promptly walks three straight, wherein McGraw looks in
vain for Matty. The Giants' ace quickly dries off, throws on a uniform, and
puts his street shoes on. By the time he arrives on the mound, reliever Joe
McGinnity has walked in a run. Matty gets a ground out, then a strikeout,
and the Giants win, 4-3. Ed Reulbach takes the loss for Chicago.

1909
At Bennett Field, Detroit and Washington play the longest scoreless game
in AL history - 18 innings. Ed Summers pitches the complete game, holding
the Senators to 7 hits and two walks (one intentional), while fanning
10. The Senators' 30-year-old rookie, Bill "Dolly" Gray, allows only one
hit before leaving with an injury after 8 innings. He is replaced by Bob
Groom. Gray will put another entry in the record books next month when he
walks 7 straight batters.

With the Senators on the road, their home field is host to the first
Congressional baseball game. The Democrats beat the Republicans, 26-16 in
7 innings.

The Giants sweep the Reds, winning the last game, 2-1, behind Mathewson. Jack
Rowan takes the loss for Cincy.

The Phillies send righthanded pitchers Buster Brown and Lew Richie and 2B
Dave Shean to the Boston Nationals for OF Johnny Bates and INF Charlie Starr.

1910
Mathewson relieves Doc Crandall and gives up three Pirate runs in the 8th
inning as the Giants lose their 4th straight to Pittsburgh, 6-3.

1913
In a game against the Cubs, Dodgers second baseman George Cutshaw handles
14 chances without an error.

1914
The Tigers, minus Cobb who is nursing a sore thumb, knock out rookie Babe
Ruth in the 4th inning and trip the Red Sox, 5-2. It is Ruth's first loss.

The Red Sox acquire 1B Dick Hoblitzell from Cincinnati.

1915
Flashing his old form, Christy Mathewson pitches a 5-hit shutout over the
Cubs to win, 2-0. He walks none in beating George Zabel.

1916
At Chicago, the Cubs and Brooklyn play a 16-inning 7-7 tie, called on
account of darkness. In the 10th inning, the Cubs' George Cutshaw swipes
home to knot the score.

1919
The Giants send Ferdie Schupp to the Cardinals for Pancho Snyder. Snyder will
do the bulk of the catching for the Giants in their pennant years of 1921-24.

1920
At Pittsburgh, the Pirates' Earl Hamilton runs out of steam after pitching
16 scoreless innings against the Giants, and loses 7-0 in 17. Rube Benton
picks up the CG win. The Giants put together three straight triples in the
last inning, with Frankie Frisch's coming with the sacks full. George Kelly
and Lee King follow Frisch with triples. Cooper then relieves to put out
the side. The 7 runs in the 17th is a ML record and comes just 2 months
after a record is set for the 16th frame.

In the first of two games, Red Faber and the White Sox top Washington, 4-1,
handing Walter Johnson his 10th loss of the season. The Washington ace,
suffering from a sore arm, will not pitch any more this season, and will
appear only as a pinch hitter in a few September games. Faber allows five
hits and stops Sam Rice's hitting streak at 28 games. Eddie Cicotte wins
the 2nd game, 8-5, when Joe Jackson hits a grand slam in the top of the
9th. It's a birthday present to himself.

Brownie pitcher Bill Bayne allows no Yankee hits until the 7th in stopping
New York, 5-2. George Sisler leads the offense going 3 for 4 with a homer,
walk and two stolen bases. Ruth is 1 for 2.

Waite Hoyt returns to the mound after eleven weeks and pitches well against
the Tigers for 9 innings before being lifted. But Bobby Veach's double in
the 10th scores Cobb and the Red Sox lose, 6-5.

The Robins hand the faltering Reds a 6-4 defeat to drop the World Champions
three games in back of Brooklyn. The Dodgers make 13 hits, and Burleigh
Grimes scatters twelve to win.

1921
At age 63, Arthur Irwin, pioneer player, manager and executive who began
in the NL in 1880, jumps to his death from a ship in the Atlantic Ocean.

1922
George Sisler drives in the first run with a sac fly against Walter Johnson
and the Browns top the Senators, 2-0.

1924
Giants 1B George Kelly hits his 7th HR in the last 6 games and becomes the
first to hit HRs in 6 consecutive games. He will finish with 21. The Giants
edge the Pirates, 8-7.

The Tigers score 8 runs in the first inning off Boston's Bill Piercy
and beat the Red Sox, 11-3. Piercy will be fined $100 for his alleged
indifferent pitching.

1930
At a packed doubleheader in Ebbets Field, the Cubs' Pat Malone stops the
Dodgers, 6-4, in the opener. The 2nd game is a free-for-all that features
Brooklyn's Del Bissonette trying to stretch a triple and being tagged out
at home by Gabby Hartnett. Bissonette is knocked unconscious and leaves on
a stretcher. Dodger P Dolf Luque, despite being hit by a pitch from Charlie
Root, defeats the Cubs 5-3.

1932
After two wins in relief over the Browns in the past two days, Washington's
Tommy Thomas gets a start and bests St. Louis, 11-0, for his 3rd win in 3
days. He gives up just 3 hits, 2 to Ferrell. He also won on July 11th beating
Chicago, the team that sold him to the Senators a month earlier. Thomas
beat the Browns 7 times in 1927, and will top them 7 times this year.

1933
Red Lucas of the Reds pitches a 15-inning 1-0 win over Roy Parmelee and
the Giants in the opener of a doubleheader. The Giants do the honors in
the nitecap, winning 1-0, as Carl Hubbell beats Paul Derringer.

1935
The A's trip the Tigers again, 8-2, at Shibe Park behind three doubles and
five RBIs from Pinky Higgins. Jimmy Foxx clouts his 17th homer to back
George Blaeholder's pitching. With the Yankees topping Chicago, Detroit
falls to 2 1/2 games behind New York.

At Wrigley, the Cubs lose, 7-5, to the Phils, the Chicubs' first loss
after 8 straight wins. For Philadelphia, the win snaps a five-game loss
streak. Jim Bivin, the Phils' 3rd hurler, gets credit for his first ML win.

1936
Braves C Al Lopez reaches first 3 times on errors, the 3rd player to do so,
each time hitting the ball to SS Billy Jurges. It is little help though
as the Cubs edge the Braves, 1-0, in 10 innings. Lon Warneke is the winner
over hard luck Ben Cantwell.

The Reds move their game with the Dodgers to August 28 because of the
high temperature.

1937
In the opener of two at Philadelphia, Cardinal P Si Johnson beats Phils
starter Bucky Walters, 10-3. Both pitchers relieve in the nitecap and
Johnson again tops Walters as the Cards win 18-10, scoring 8 runs in the 10th
inning. There are six homers in the two games, with Terry Moore collecting
two. St. Louis is now tied for 3rd with Pittsburgh.

At Detroit, the Tigers score 7 runs in the 6th inning on one hit and seven
passes to trounce the Yankees, 14-7. Monte Pearson starts the action by
walking three on 15 pitches, fans Gee Walker, then walks Rudy York. Pat
Malone then gives up a hit and walks two. Two errors and another walk forces
in a 7th run before Gee Walker strikes out again to end it. Detroit bats
around in the 8th to score another 5 runs off Johnny Broaca. Poffenberger
is the winning recipient. New York ends its 9-game win streak, but stays
6 1/2 ahead of Boston.

The Bees' freshman sensation Lou Fette records his 11th win, stopping the
NL-leading Cubs, 6-1. Vince DiMaggio supplies the firepower with a single,
triple and homer off Bill Lee.

1939
Bees All-Star SS Eddie Miller collides with teammate OF Al Simmons and
fractures a bone in his ankle. He will be out for the season. The Bees beat
the Reds, 3-0, behind Bill Posedel, before losing game 2, 4-3.

1941
DiMaggio is 3 for 4 as the Yanks pummel the Indians, 10-3. Joe's streak is
now at 56 games.

Chet Laabs has a record-tying 4 long hits - 2 homers, a triple and double -
to pace the Browns to an 11-2 win over the A's. Bob Muncrief is the winner.

1942
The Reds trade pitcher Jim Turner, along with Bobby Abreau, and cash to
the Yankees for minor leaguer Frank Kelleher. Kelleher is leading the IL
in HRs with 23.

Chattanooga's Joe Engel signs pro ball's only Chinese player, George Ho. Ho
is a junior at St. Johns in New York and hit .380 in two years of semipro
ball in NYC.

1944
In the first of two games, the Dodgers score 8 unearned runs against the
Braves to win 8-5 and break their 16-game losing streak. Curt Davis is the
winner. They will lose another 5 in a row. The 16 straight is the longest
losing streak in the NL since the Reds of 1914 lost 19.

1946
Pinch-hitter Erv Dusak fails on a sacrifice attempt, then hits a dramatic
3-run HR in the 9th to give the Cards a 5-4 win over Brooklyn and a sweep
of their 4-game series. The win, Howie Pollet's 10th of the year, moves
St. Louis to within a half-game of the first place Dodgers. The four games,
including a doubleheader, brings 87,027 to Sportsman's Park.

At Fenway, Bob Feller tops Tex Hughson and the Red Sox, 6-3. Feller lost to
Hughson, 1-0, in their last meeting, but wins his 16th today, fanning 7. Ken
Keltner belts two homers and Pat Seerey adds one, his 14th, off Tex. Heinz
Becker, in his first AL game, adds two doubles and a single. Ted Williams,
in 5 at-bats against the "Williams Wall," is 2 for 5, trickling a single
into left and smashing a line-drive triple past Seerey in RF. Boston remains
in first place by 11 games.

The Phils manage just 4 hits off Ewell Blackwell, but hand the Reds pitcher
a 2-0 defeat. Schoolboy Rowe gives up 5 hits in winning his 9th.

At Ogdensburg (Border League), Ogdensburg rolls over Granby, 35-14, as the
Maples outhit the Red Sox, 32-21. Maples playing-manager Bob Dill pickles
the ball going 6 for 6 with 2 homeruns, a triple, 3 doubles and 10 RBIs.

1947
Less than two weeks after Larry Doby's debut with the Indians, Hank Thompson
and Willard Brown become the second and third black players in the American
League and first for the Browns. The former Kansas City Monarchs standouts
will play in less than 30 games for St. Louis because their presence does
not significantly raise attendance.

In a Yankee uniform for just 2 days, Bobo Newsom records his 200th victory,
a 3-1 win over Cleveland. It is New York's 17th straight win. Vic Raschi
adds another win with a 7-2 victory in the nitecap.

1948
There are 3 managerial changes today. Ben Chapman is fired by the Phillies
(though owner Carpenter insists he was "not fired" saying "I'd like to
make it clear that there is a difference between not firing a man and
concluding business with him.") and Dusty Cooke takes over on an interim
basis. Eddie Sawyer, with no ML experience as player or manager, will get
the job after Cooke goes 8-6. But the big news is from New York. The Giants
remove Mel Ott and replace him with Leo Durocher, who obtains his release
from Brooklyn. The Dodgers bring back mild-mannered Burt Shotton who replaced
Durocher once before. In a newspaper poll over the winter, an overwhelming
majority voted for the gentlemanly Shotton to replace "The Lip". The changes
today portend those at the end of the season: Bucky Harris of the Yankees,
Ted Lyons of the White Sox and Steve O'Neill of the Tigers will be released.

The Browns frustrate the third-place Yanks, whipping Allie Reynolds,
10-4. Bob Dillinger leads the way with a bases-loaded triple, three singles,
two stolen bases and 5 RBIs. Cliff Fannin holds the Yanks scoreless until
Phil Rizzuto's homer in the 8th.

Ordered by Bill Veeck to pass up the All-Star game, a well-rested Bob
Feller is shelled from the mound with only one out in the first inning by
the A's. The A's score first when Feller absent-mindedly goes into a windup
with two on, and Coleman and McCosky pull a double steal. The Mackmen then
jump on Bob Muncrief and roll to a 10-5 win over the AL-leading Indians. Lou
Brissie wins his 4th straight. Joe Coleman will shut out the Tribe, 5-0,
tomorrow to split the series.

Rookie Granny Hamner drives in 7 runs to lead the Phils to an 11-10 squeaker
over the Cardinals. Hamner has a pair of doubles and a single to go along
with spectacular fielding, starting DPs in the 8th and 9th. Ken Heintzelman,
who relieves Blix Donnelly after Stan Musial's grand slam in the 2nd,
is the winner.

1949
At Boston, Warren Spahn hits a 2-run homer and hurls the Braves to a 6-1
win over the Cubs. Pete Reiser paces the 12-hit attack on the Bruins with
4 hits. Jeff Heath, making his 1st appearance since fracturing his ankle
last September, is 1 for 5.

The Reds win for the first time in 9 games at Ebbets Field, winning 7-6 in
10 innings. Walker Cooper's 2nd homer of the game, a 2-run shot in the 10th
off reliever Rex Barney, is the margin of victory. Cooper's first homer,
in the 2nd inning, opened the scoring and the Dodgers retaliated in the
same frame, scoring on a triple steal executed by Robinson, Hodges and Cox.

1950
The ML players connect for 37 HRs today for a new record. Leading the offense
today is Cincinnati with two wins over the Giants, 16-4 and 11-10. In the
AL, the Red Sox and Indians hit 7 HRs in their doubleheader split ... Moose
Dropo collects 3 homers.

The Cubs knock the Phillies out of a tie for first place, sweeping 8-0 and
10-3. The Cubs lose Cavarretta when he is hit by a Johnson pitch in game
1, fracturing his forearm. Hank Sauer takes over 1B. Walt Dubiel fires the
shutout and Doyle Lade is the CG winner in game 2. The loss goes to Bob Miller
in game 2, the first defeat for the rookie after 8 straight wins. Ex-Bruin
Russ Meyer loses the first game after defeating the Cubs 5 straight times
(as noted by Ed Hartig). The Mad Monk, the greatest ever Cubs killer,
will win his next 17 decisions against Chicago before losing on May 11, 1955.

1951
While in Detroit, the Yanks option rookie Mickey Mantle to Kansas City
(AA). Mantle, plagued with strikeouts - 3 on the 13th - and in a slump,
will go 0 for 22 in his start with the Blues, before ending with a tear at
.361. The Yankees will recall him August 20th. Art Schallock takes Mickey's
place on the Yankee roster and gives up 7 hits in 2 2/3 innings in today's
8-6 win.

1952
Walt Dropo gets 2 more hits, giving him 15 in 4 games, which ties another AL
record by Joe Cronin. Dropo scores 3 runs in the 9-0 win at Washington. Bill
Wight allows just 4 hits in the shutout.

1953
The Browns tie a record with 3 successive HRs - by Clint Courtney, Dick
Kryhoski and Jim Dyck - in the first inning, and their 5 bases-empty HRs
in 3 innings establishes a new mark. It's enough to beat the Yankees, 8-6.

1954
Gus Bell drives in 6 runs to give the Reds a 9-6 win over the Phils.

1956
The Detroit Tigers and Briggs Stadium are sold to a group headed by Fred

lidlifter, P Jack Harshman of the Orioles hits 2 HRs and drives in 4 runs
in a 6-5 win in the nitecap.

Testifying before the Senate subcommittee on Anti-Trust and Monopoly,
Commissioner Ford Frick asks the Senate to approve legislation to curb
television and radio broadcasts of baseball games. Minor league baseball towns
are being wrecked, he claims. "We have got to be able to handle this problem
or within 10 years there will be no television problem because there will be
no baseball." When asked about the possibility of the Washington franchise
shifting cities, Frick replies, "Removal of the club from Washington would
be catastrophic. Baseball cannot afford not to be in Washington."

1959
After beating the Indians yesterday, the Yanks sweep a doubleheader today
to knock the Tribe out of first. New York wins the opener when Berra ties
the game in the 9th with a homer, and Mantle wins it, 7-5, in the 10th with
a 2-run shot off Gary Bell. Bobby Shantz wins the nitecap, 4-0. New York
is 5 1/2 games out of first.

1961
Detroit regains 1st place with two complete game victories from Phil Regan

Steve Barber regains first place for the Orioles with a successful 6-1
outing against the Yankees and Jim Bouton.

innings. New York manages just 4 hits, including a solo homer by Mickey
Mantle, off Bill Dillman.

1968
Jose Cardenal becomes the first outfielder in 37 years and only the fourth
flychaser overall to record two unassisted double plays in one season
(the first was June 8th versus the Tigers). The Cleveland outfielder joins
Socks Seybold (1907 A's), Tris Speaker (1918 Indians) and Adam Comorosky
(1931 Pirates) in accomplishing the rare feat. The Tribe win today, 2-1,
over the Angels.

Glenn Beckert runs his hit streak to 21 games when he hits a 12th-inning
double to drive in the winning run in a 4-3 victory over the Phils. Regan
is the winner in relief of Holtzman.

1969
After White Sox lefty Jerry Nyman walks in a run with the bases loaded,
Rod Carew steals home for the 7th time, as the AL-West leading Twins sweep a
twin bill, winning 9-8 and 6-3 from the White Sox. Carew ties Pete Reiser's
ML record for steals of home in a season, a record since given back to Ty
Cobb (8 steals in 1912) in 1991 after further research.

Despite 4 homers by Montreal, the Pirates beat the Expos, 8-7, scoring 3 in
the 8th and 3 in the 9th. The Pirates' only homer comes in the 8th inning
with Matty Alou on 2B and Dan McGinn pitching, when Willie Stargell splashes
a pitch over the RF fence into the municipal swimming pool at Jarry Park.

1970
On precisely the same spot as Exposition Park, the home of the Pirates from
1891-1909, Three Rivers Stadium makes its debut. Cincinnati's first baseman
Tony Perez hits the park's first homerun as the Pirates lose to the Reds,
3-2. Willie Stargell homers for Pittsburgh. The Pirates parade their new
uniforms of stretchable cotton and nylon.

Chicago's Ken Holtzman gives up two hits and two Astro runs - both unearned
- and drops a 2-1 decision at Houston. Billy Williams makes a bid for
a game-tying homer in the 9th but his long fly hits a Dome speaker and
drops foul.

1971
Vida Blue boosts his record to 18-3 with a one-hit 4-0 victory over
Detroit. Taylor's single in the 4th is the only hit.

Until today, only 3 balls have been hit into the 70-foot high RF upper
deck at Three Rivers Stadium, and Willie Stargell hit all of them (he'll
hit another on May 31, 1973). Today Bob Robertson joins Stargell when he
connects with a cannon shot off Padres P Steve Arlin in a Bucs victory.

M's lose their 9th in a row with the loss going to former Hubman Dick Pole.

Tulsa's Dave Righetti strikes out 21 Midland batters in 9 innings to set
a Texas League record. A Tulsa reliever loses the game 4-2 in extra innings.

1980
Despite much speculation that he is simply malingering, the Astros place
star pitcher J. R. Richard on the 21-day disabled list with a mystery
arm problem. The 6 foot 8 inch righthander is 10-4 with a 1.89 ERA and
119 strikeouts in 114 innings, but has removed himself from 10 games this
year complaining of fatigue and a "dead arm." On July 23rd, Richard will
check into a hospital for a series of physical and psychological tests to
determine the cause of his "erratic" behavior.

The California Supreme Court rules that Ted Giannoulas, better known as the
man inside the San Diego Chicken suit, can appear publicly in chicken suits
similar to the one that brought him fame, but not bearing the call letters of
San Diego's KGB radio station. The station had fired Giannoulas when he began
appearing publicly in the suit without permission, and claimed it had all
rights to the costume, which was first used as a promotional device in 1975.

1985
Marking its 21st victory in the last 23 (and 13th in the last 14)
Midsummer Classics, the National League beats the AL, 6-1, at Minnesota's
Metrodome. Sparky Anderson, who was the first manager to win 100 games in
both the National and American Leagues, becomes the first skipper to lose
an All-Star game in each league. San Diego's LaMarr Hoyt allows one unearned
run in 3 innings and is named MVP.

Edwards a win over the White Sox, 4-3.

Don Mattingly bangs two homers, one a second-inning grand slam, to pace
the Yankees to a 12-3 win over host Texas. Mattingly now has 7 homers in 6
games. His 2nd-inning grand slam, his 4th of the year, off Charlie Hough,
followed a bases-loaded walk to Mike Pagliarulo. Hough had 8 strikeouts
but his knuckleball was too much for little-used catcher Mike Stanley,
who sets an AL record with 5 passed balls. His teammate Geno Petralli will
break the record next month with 6 passed balls.

Houston rookie Ken Caminiti debuts with a bang. He hits a triple in the 5th
inning, a homer in the 7th, and scores the winning run in the 9th following
a walk. The Astros beat the Phillies, 2-1. Caminiti is just the 4th major
leaguer to debut with a homer and triple.

1988
In the longest game ever played in Texas League history, the San Antonio
Missions beat the visiting Jackson Mets in 26 innings, 1-0. The Keefe Stadium

broken off negotiations with the Cubs management and would become a free
agent after the season. Maddux is playing on a one-year contract. "I've

taken care of." Tomorrow, Maddux will beat the first-place Pirates.

1993

consecutive game without an error. He snaps Don Demeter's record. The Giants
defeat the Mets, 4-2.

lashes out 5 hits, including a double. The win opens up Cleveland's lead
in the AL Central to 14 1/2 games.

1996
Although the team beats the Giants, 5-3, the Rockies' streak of scoring
seven runs in a game comes to an end at 11. Colorado's mark ties the record

After failing to score in their first 2 at-bats, the Brewers proceed to
score in each of their remaining turns at the plate to punch out Detroit

leads the AL with 88, while Jose Valentin knocks out 4 hits.

1997
Kevin Brown tosses his first career one-hitter, leading Florida over Los
Angeles, 5-1. Brown, who no-hit San Francisco on June 10, faces just two
batters over the minimum, allowing a lead-off single to left by Raul Mondesi
in the fifth. He strikes out 8 and retires his final 15 batters to hand
the loss to Hideo Nomo.

At Shea, RF Sammy Sosa's running catch with the bases loaded in the seventh,
and catcher Scott Servais' pickoff in the eighth, key Chicago to a 6-5
win over the Mets. Before the game, New York reassigns general manager Joe
McIlvaine and replaces him with his assistant, Steve Phillips.

In Oakland, Mark McGwire hits his 33rd and 34th homers to lead the A's to
an 11-3 win over the hapless Royals. Jose Canseco strikes out in all five
at-bats for the Athletics, tying an Oakland record. Combined with his three
strikeouts on Monday, he ties a major league record with eight whiffs in
two consecutive games.

1998
