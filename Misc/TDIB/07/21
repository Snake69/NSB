1902
At Brooklyn, the Superbas maul the Phillies, 10-1, nicking Doc White for
14 hits. Doc gets his due in the 4-run 5th inning when he strikes out 4
batters, the first pitcher to strike out 4 in an inning since 1888 and the
first to do it at 60' 6" (the record books list Wiltse in 1906 as the first
this century). The Brooklyn Eagle reports tomorrow, "White had the unusual
record of four strikeouts in one inning yesterday. It happened in the fifth
when the Superbas scored their second cluster of four runs. Dahlen and
Irwin fanned while two runs were being scored. Then Wheeler came up and
slashed at a bad pitch on his third attempt, the ball slipping through
Dooin's hands to the fence. Wheeler got first on the error and Ahearn
[now listed in the record books as Hearne] scored. Then after Kitson had
singled, White retired Sheckard on strikes. The Philadelphia twirler is
credited with four strikeouts in the records." The New York Times notes
only the first 3 strikeouts, saying that Wheeler stole second and Dooin's
wild throw allows McCrory to score. "Wheeler got in with the last run made
in the game on Kitson's single to left field," ends the Times story. White
fans 5 in the game.

The Athletics spot visiting Cleveland 6 runs, then tie it in the 7th on
three errors and a homerun by Topsy Hartsel. Hartsel scores the winning
run in the 9th to win, 11-10. Rube Waddell, with a scoreless two innings
of work, gets the decision.

The New York Herald writes that "Harry Wolverton is a Quaker," noting that
their former third baseman had "informed the 'Phillies' he had tired of his
job with the Washington American League club and had decided to go back to
his first love. He will meet the 'Phillies' when they return home." Wolverton
hit .249 for the Senators this year.

1903
At Washington Park, Brooklyn tips the Giants and Mathewson, 4-1. Ned Garvin
picks up the win, blanking New York for the first 8 innings.

1904
Mathewson picks up his 1st relief win of the season, as the Giants clip the
Cubs, 4-3. Matty relieves McGinnity in the 6th as the Cubs score twice. In
the 7th, Frank Chance belts a game-tying inside-the-park homer, but Roger
Bresnahan retaliates with a 9th-inning drive that gets by Jim Slagle for
a homer. Jake Weimer takes the loss.

1908
In St. Louis, the Cards split with the Giants, with Harry Sallee losing
the opener, 4-2. Mathewson wins his 21st straight over St. Louis, though he
gives up 11 hits in the victory. The Cards beat Dummy Taylor in the nitecap,
3-1 in 12 innings.

According to a Chicago newspaper contest, the Giants' Mike Donlin, the
NL's leading hitter, is baseball's most popular player. Turkey Mike tops
Honus Wagner by a wide margin and will be awarded a trophy cup. Donlin was
involved in a car accident on the 18th when the car in which he was riding on
Michigan Avenue, collided with another vehicle driven by Chicago Mayor Busse.

1905
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants score 6 runs in the 2nd inning against
St. Louis, with Sam Mertes' grand slam providing the big blow. Mathewson
is given the afternoon off after 5 innings, with New York in command,
10-2. New York wins, 14-2, pinning the loss on Jack Taylor.

In Chicago, Sox manager Comiskey protests when the Highlanders use Doc
Powers. Powers joined the New York squad in Cleveland on July 14 after
the A's loaned the first baseman as a replacement for Patsy Dougherty,
who injured his finger (see entry July 13, 1905). Powers is to return to
the A's tomorrow when Fred Curtis is expected to join the Highlanders from
the Copper League. Orth and Altrock battle each other and the White Sox
score with 2 out in the 9th to tie at 1-1. Another run in the 12th gives
the White Sox the victory.

1911
The Braves acquire SS Al Bridwell and C Hank Gowdy from the Giants for
Buck Herzog. For Bridwell and Herzog, it is their 2nd tours of duty with
their teams, while the young Gowdy will be the Boston catcher for the next
ten years.

1913
Walter Johnson and the Senators are victors over the White Sox rookie
pitcher Reb Russell. Russell will come back tomorrow and be the winner over
Washington, 6-5.

1914
Dick Rudolph throws a 3-hitter to give the Braves their second straight
whitewash of the Pirates, winning 6-0. Rudolph will end the year with 27
victories, tied with Alexander; one of his credited wins is a game in which
he started and left after 3 innings. The Braves move ahead of the Reds and
Phils into 4th place.

The Reds lose, 6-5, to the Giants in 13 innings. Mathewson pitches shutout
ball for the last 5 innings and singles in the winning run to pin the loss
on Red Ames.

1915
The Phils stop the Cubs, 1-0, in a rain-shortened game in Philley. Alexander
gets the victory.

Babe Ruth pitches and bats the Red Sox to a 4-2 win over the host St. Louis
Browns. Ruth is 4 for 4 with a tremendous homer and two doubles, and knocks
in 3 runs. He scatters 5 hits with the two St. Louis runs coming on Heinie
Wagner errors.

1916
Mathewson, in his first game as the Reds manager, puts Edd Roush in CF,
and the future star responds with a two-run triple and goes 3 for 5. But
the Phils top Cincy, 6-4.

1917
The Red and White Sox battle to a 15-inning 5-5 tie called on account of
darkness. Ruth tosses the last five innings for Boston, giving up no runs
in his first relief appearance of the year. Chicago will win the next two
games to keep a firm hold on first place.

1918
A's rookie Mule Watson toils 11 innings and gives up 12 hits before losing
to the Indians, 3-2. Undaunted, the aptly named Mule pitches the nitecap,
scattering 10 hits in 8 innings before the game is declared a 5-5 tie so
the Indians can catch a train.

At Braves Field, a crowd of 15,000 watch a doubleheader in which the Boston
Base sailors defeat the Marine Corp of the Boston Navy Yard, 4-1. In the
nitecap at the Wigwam, Camp Bevens wallops Fort Andrews, 15-4, driving
starter Frank Fahey, briefly with the A's, from the mound.

August Herrmann, Reds president and chairman of the national baseball
commission, announces the cancellation of a pair of games in Chicago
tomorrow. Herrmann says they are makeup games and that the Reds will be
traveling East to play their regularly scheduled games.

1919
The Tigers rough up Boston P Babe Ruth, scoring 6 runs with the help of two
errors by Wally Schang. Down 6-1 in the 9th, Babe answers with a tremendous
solo shot that lands on Trumbull Avenue, the longest home run ever hit at
Navin Field.

At Chicago, Dickie Kerr of the White Sox wins both ends of DH against the
Yankees. Kerr is the relief winner in each, winning 5-4 and 9-8.

1920
In New York, the first place Indians (58-28) open a series with the Yankees
(58-32) and are held in check through 8 innings by Carl Mays. Wilting in
the 9th, Mays gives up 3 runs and is relieved by Rip Collins. Ray Chapman
fans with the sacks full to end the game and New York holds on to win,
4-3. Meusel and Pipp homer for New York, while the Babe is hitless for the
second game in a row.

1921
The Indians and the Yankees bang out 16 doubles collectively to establish
a new American League record. The Tribe, with nine of the two-baggers,
beat the Bronx Bombers in Cleveland's League Park, 17-8. The Indians,
who cling to a 2-game lead, are led by Joe Sewell's 5 hits.

Chicago's Red Faber wins his 20th game, but it is not easy. He goes 14
innings before edging the A's 2-1, on Bibb Falk's leadoff HR in the 14th
off starter Naylor. Red is helped along the way by a Sheely-Johnston triple
play. There will be five 20-game winners in the AL, 4 in the NL.

1922
The Cubs edge Brooklyn 1-0 as Grover Cleveland Alexander wins the duel with
Dutch Ruether in just 73 minutes. Ray Grimes, who drove in 3 runs yesterday,
doubles in the only Cub tally. Grimes now has RBIs in 15 straight games.

1923
At Philadelphia, the Phils score 12 runs in the 6th inning, a NL record for
the frame, to ease home 17-4, against Chicago in game 1. The Cubs retaliate
in the nitecap, winning 16-9.

1924
Cleveland's George Burns clouts 2 homers and 2 doubles to lead the Indians to
a 16-12 slugfest over the Red Sox. Burns had 4 long hits (3 doubles and a HR)
on June 19th and is the first player to accomplish the feat twice in a season.

1925
In game 1 of a double-header split with the White Sox, Boston's Roy Carlyle
becomes the first AL rookie to hit for the cycle. The Hubmen win the opener,
6-3 before losing 8-3.

1926
The Tigers take the first of 2 over Washington, 7-6. Off Washington's Walter
Johnson in game 2, Heinie Manush cracks a double, triple and three-run
homer but the Big Train still wins over Detroit, 10-7.

1928
Jimmie Foxx hits the longest drive ever seen out of Shibe Park as the A's
take two from St. Louis, 8-2 and 7-3. The sweep increases their lead over the
3rd-place Browns to 10 games. Foxx' drive, off Johnny Ogden, clears the LF
stands. Al Simmons adds a homer in the 9th to give Lefty Grove the win. In the
nitecap, 43-year-old Jack Quinn spits his way to his 13th win against just 4
losses. Joe Hauser and Jimmy Dykes hit roundtrippers off Lefty Stewart. In an
unusual display of consistency, every A's batter collects a hit in each game.

In St. Louis, the Phillies finally win, 8-3, stopping their loss streak at 12
games. Sugar Sweetland wins over Clarence Mitchell. Rookie Pinkie Whitney and
Freddie Leach homer for the Phils, while Chick Hafey connects for the Birds.

1929
Wes Ferrell outpitches Waite Hoyt to give Cleveland a 6-4 win over
the Yankees. Babe Ruth, still nursing a leg injury, contributes a pinch
single. Gehrig is tossed in the 4th inning for protesting a strike-3 call,
and Miller Huggins quickly follows.

The A's beat Detroit again, winning 10-7, in 11 innings.

The Robins beat the Cubs, 3-1, dropping Chicago out of first place. It
is Brooklyn's first win in 10 starts against the Cubs. Dazzy Vance is the
winner, striking out 10 including Hack Wilson 4 times. His only mistake is
a solo homer to Hornsby. Pat Malone takes the loss.

1930
Four pinch-hit HRs are hit during a doubleheader split between Brooklyn
and St. Louis. Hal Lee and Harvey Hendrick connect for Brooklyn; George
Puccinelli and Jim Bottomley homer for the Cards. The homers represent the
first ML hits for both Lee and Puccinelli. Hendrick's pinch homer with two
on and two out in the 9th gives Brooklyn a 9-8 win over Flint Rhem in the
opener. Guy Mancuso, Frankie Frisch and Bottomley homer in the opener as the
Cardinals score all their runs on homeruns. Led by Andy High's four hits,
the Redbirds outslug the Robins for a 17-10 win in the nitecap. In that game,
Brooklyn's Hal Lee adds to the day's homer barrage with his first ML hit,
a 3-run pinch homer in the 2nd inning off Al Grabowski. The day's carnage
results in 54 hits, 44 runs, 18 extra base hits and 11 errors. The split
drops Brooklyn into second place.

The Cubs ruin the first Ladies Day at the Polo Grounds as Pat Malone and
Charlie Root shut out the Giants, 6-0. Malone is the winner over Tiny Jim
Chaplin. About 3,500 women are admitted free, and then see Hack Wilson club
two homers, #28 and #29, to help Chicago move back into first place. Hack
also whiffs with the bases jammed in the 9th. This is the first of regular
Friday afternoon Ladies Day promotions that New York will be running.

Ruth cracks homer #35, Gehrig belts his 28th, his 3rd homer in 2 games,
and Harry Rice adds another homer to lead the Yanks to a 7-3 win over
Cleveland. Lefty Ed Wells is the winner despite giving up 4 hits to John
Hodapp. Ruth is 12 games ahead of his 1927 pace.

Dallas (Texas League) drops Grover Cleveland Alexander after he fails to
stay in training.

1935
The Tigers finally get to Lefty Grove, scoring a run in the 8th and 3 more
in the 9th to take a 4-2 lead. In the bottom of the 9th, while Grove is
tearing up the clubhouse, pitcher Wes Ferrell pinch hits for Lefty and hits
a homerun with 2 outs and 2 men on to give Boston a 7-6 win. Grove has now
won 6 straight.

1936
Cardinals slugger Joe Medwick has 10 hits in succession to equal the NL
record. He had 7 hits in his last 7 times at-bat in a doubleheader on the
19th, and he hits safely in his first three today. He is finally stopped
by the Giants' Carl Hubbell. The Giants break a 1-1 tie on Dick Bartell's
homer in the 10th off Dizzy Dean to win, 2-1.

Mickey Cochrane has a relapse, and Del Baker again takes charge of the
Tigers. Detroit takes a pair from the visiting A's, winning 8-0 behind Tommy
Bridges, and 9-8, as Schoolboy Rowe wins in relief. The Tigers score a pair
in the 8th inning when, with the bases loaded, Mickey Owen hits into a double
play. Goslin scores the tying run and Walker, who reaches 3rd on the play,
scores when 1B Chubby Dean is caught napping.

1937
Rogers Hornsby is fired as manager of the St. Louis Browns "for just cause,"
again construed as playing the horses. Hornsby grouses, "they always bring
that up." Jim Bottomley takes over.

1938
Linus "Skeeter" Ebnet, 23-year-old shortstop of the Winnipeg club of the

Young homers to lead off the 8th. The Giants get one more hit and lose, 6-1.

1942
At Forbes Field, the Monarchs' (Negro League) Satchel Paige performs one
of his legendary feats. Years earlier, Paige told Josh Gibson that one day
he would strike him out with the bases loaded. With a man on, 2 outs, and
Gibson 3rd up, Paige walks the next 2 Grays to bring Gibson up. Satchel
tells the crowd what is going to happen. "Three fastballs, Josh," Paige
tells him, then proceeds to strike him out.

1944
The Senators score 4 in the 8th and one in the 9th, but Detroit comes back
with 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th to win, 6-5. Dizzy Trout picks up his
13th win and homers in the process. Chuck Hostetler, has 3 hits and drives
in the winning run in the 9th. The 40-year-old rookie is now 3rd in the
league in batting.

1945
The Detroit Tigers and the Philadelphia Athletics battle to a 1-1 tie in
24 innings, with the A's pulling off a DP with the sacks full to finish the
contest. Les Mueller hurls the first 19 2/3 innings, scattering 13 hits and
walking 5 for the Tigers. Dizzy Trout pitches the rest. Mueller's outing
is the longest since George Uhle and Ted Lyons went head-to-head in 1929,
and no hurler has matched Mueller's endurance feat since. He was helped
by Jimmy Outlaw, who throws a runner out at home in the 10th after the A's
make 3 singles. The A's use just two hurlers:  Russ Christopher (13 innings)
and Joe Berry (11 innings). The top hitter is Bobby Estalella who goes 5
for 10. The match lasts an AL-record 4 hours 48 minutes before umpire Bill
Summers calls it at 7:48 p.m. because "he couldn't see the ball" (an AL
rule prevents the lights being turned on during a scheduled day game). The
AL's longest previous match was 4 hours 47 minutes on September 1, 1906.

The Yankees bomb the White Sox into 6th place, 12-3, with the help of three
homers. Nick Etten connects with the bases full, and Herschel Martin and
Bud Metheny connect as well. Ernie Bonham wins his 2nd of the year as the
Yankees chase Earl Caldwell in the 1st inning.

Chief Specialist Bob Feller hurls a perfect no-hitter as his Great Lakes
Naval Training team trims the visiting Ford All-Stars, 13-0, before 10,000
sailors. Feller's catcher Walker Cooper belts a two-run homer to key a
five-run 4th inning.

Assault charges against umpire George Magerkurth are dismissed. The ump and a
fan got into a fight three days ago after a doubleheader in Cincinnati. The
ump complained that the fan, Tom Longo, had been riding him all season, but
Longo contended that Magerkurth had confused him with the real heckler. The
two shook hands.

1946
Lew Flick sets a professional baseball record when he collects nine
consecutive hits in a single game, before grounding out in his final
at-bat in the 19-inning opener against Memphis. The Little Rock Travelers'
outfielder will get three more hits off the Chicks' pitching staff in
the nightcap, finishing the day 12 for 13 in the Southern Association (AA)
doubleheader. Teammate Kerby Farrell collects 8 hits in the first game. Both
players will make it to the majors.

In a doubleheader sweep against the visiting Browns, Ted Williams collects 7
straight hits, including hitting for the cycle in the nitecap. Boo Ferriss
wins his 15th in the opener, 5-0, for his 5th shutout of the year, while
Williams is 3 for 4. Williams starts the nitecap with a 2nd-inning homer,
off loser Cliff Fannin, his 27th homer of the year. In the 3rd, Ted follows
with a line drive that hits the bullpen wall in right center, then caroms
off CF Walt Judnich's thigh, and Williams has a triple. Joe Dobson, with
relief help from Bob Klinger, is the winner, 7-4.

1947
Frankie Frisch (.316) becomes the first switch-hitter inducted into the
Hall of Fame. The 'Fordham Flash' is joined by Carl Hubbell, Mickey Cochrane
and Lefty Grove as the newest members to be enshrined at Cooperstown.

1949
Walker Cooper's grand slam against his old teammates is overshadowed by
Bobby Thomson who has a pair of homers good for 6 runs. The Giants whip
the Reds, 9-5.

1951
The Cubs fall to the host Phillies and Robin Roberts, 5-0. With the Cubs 10
games under .500 at 35-45, Phil Cavarretta replaces Frankie Frisch (141-196)
as manager. They will go 27-47 the rest of the way to finish in last place.

The Reds purchase Hank Edward from the Dodgers and sell Barney McCosky to
the Indians.

1953

the win.

1954

but still loses to Washington, 6-5. An error by Jim Bridewiser in the 9th
allows an unearned run to score.

1955

1956
Junior Gilliam of the Brooklyn Dodgers makes 12 assists at 2B to tie the

St. Louis wins, 13-6.

Brooks Lawrence has his 13-game winning streak snapped when Roberto Clemente
hits a 3-run homer in the top of the 9th. The Pirates edge the Reds, 4-3,
with Elroy Face winning in relief.

throwing a single pitch to a batter. The Cubs lose, 7-2, to the Dodgers
with Bob Rush taking the loss.

At Cleveland, the Yankees split, winning the opener and losing the nitecap,
7-4. Mantle pops out in the 7th of the nitecap after reaching base 10
straight times. He has a single, walk and homer off Ray Narleski in game
2, after collecting a single and four walks in the opener. He concluded
yesterday's game with two walks.

1959
Under intense public pressure and the Massachusetts Committee Against
Discrimination investigation, the Red Sox become the last club to
integrate. Fourteen years after Boston passes on Jackie Robinson despite
a successful tryout in 1945, Elijah 'Pumpsie' Green pinch runs and plays
shortstop to become the first black to play for the team. The White Sox win,
2-1. Tomorrow, Green goes 0 for 3 against Early Wynn in a 5-4 Sox win that
propels them into 1st place.

1960
Robin Roberts pitches his 3rd career one-hitter, and the 3rd one-hitter of

is the AL's 6th of the season, a new record.

1962

in the previous day's game against the Cardinals.

The Reds purchase pitcher Joe Nuxhall from San Diego (PCL). For Nuxhall,

1963
The usually mild-mannered Dodger manager Walter Alston is thrown out of
both games of a doubleheader when the Braves sweep a twin bill from Los
Angeles for the first and only time in Milwaukee, 7-2 and 13-7. To make
matters worse, the manager has beer thrown in his face by a hometown fan
as he leaves the second game. (Thanks to Lee for sharing this entry. He
attended the game at County Stadium as a 10-year-old.)

In the second game of a double-header, Pirates outfielder Jerry Lynch
pinch-hits a three-run homerun off Chicago's Lindy McDaniel in the ninth
inning to tie the Forbes Field contest at five, a game the Bucs will evenually
win in 14 innings, 6-5. The heroic homer is the left-handed hitter's 14th

At Jack Murphy Stadium, Clay Kirby has a no-hitter going for 8 innings,
but with 2 outs in the 8th and trailing 1-0, Padres manager Preston Gomez
lifts him for pinch hitter Cito Gaston. Gaston fails to get a hit off Mets
starter Jim McAndrew, and reliever Jack Baldschun gives up 2 runs in the
9th. The Padres lose, 3-0. Gomez will repeat the mistake on September 4, 1974.

1972
The Dodgers release P Hoyt Wilhelm, ending his Hall of Fame career 2 days
