Jul 23

1901
Brooklyn batters a wild Christy Mathewson for 6 hits in two innings,
knocking him out of the game in the 3rd, the first time this season Matty
has not finished a start. The Giants lose, 8-3.

Jack Chesbro stops the visiting Reds, 9-2, and Fred Clarke backs him up by
hitting for the cycle.

1902
John McGraw has his first win as the Giants manager, when New York downs
Brooklyn, 4-1.

Baltimore, McGraw's old team, downs the visiting White Sox, 7-5, behind
rookie Charlie Shields. Shields pitched the last 4 innings of yesterday's
game against Detroit without giving up a hit or a run, and does the same
in the first 7 innings today. After 11 straight no-hit innings, he allows
5 runs in the 8th but holds on for the win. Baltimore will think so much
of Shields, they'll sell him to the Browns in September.

In front of a "big crowd" (Philadelphia Inquirer) in Atlantic City,
the locals beat the Cuban X Giants, 2-1, in 11 innings. Chick Hartley's
11th-inning homer over the RF fence is the winning blow.

Both Boston teams are at home. The Boston Americans whip the Browns, 3-2,
in 13 innings, taking 1 hour 55 minutes to do it. Bill Dinneen is the winner
in front of 5,046. The Boston Nationals win, 3-0, in front of just 600 fans.

1903
In a doubleheader with New York, Cy Young wins the opener, 6-1, in a match
that takes 1 hour 35 minutes. New York wins the nitecap, 4-2.

1904
At Chicago, more than 25,000 see Christy Mathewson and the Giants best the
Cubs' Three Finger Brown, 5-1. Matty allows 6 hits while whiffing 6.

Following a doubleheader split with Washington, Detroit manager Ed Barrow
resigns. The Tigers are 32-46.

After losing 3-1 to Boston in the opener, the Reds unload for a 15-1 win in
game 2. Leading the offense is Cy Seymour, who goes 5 for 5 with 2 doubles
and a triple, and 5 runs scored.

1905
Behind Cy Young Boston beats Detroit, 6-1, and would've scored more except
for 5 DPs started by SS Charley O'Leary, an AL record that will be tied
but never topped this century.

The Philadelphia Athletics edge the White Sox, 1-0. Sox SS Goerge Davis
pulls off a hidden ball trick in the first inning nabbing Topsy Hartsel.

1906
The White Sox and A's exchange shutouts, with Chicago taking game 1, 4-0,
and the A's winning the nitecap, 3-0. After losing 2 to Philadelphia on
the 25th, the Sox trail the 3rd place Athletics by 9 games.

1907
The Washington Senators conclude a 31-game road trip, the longest in AL
history, losing to Cleveland, 3-1.

The Austin Senators (Texas League) steal 23 bases and beat San Antonio, 44-0.

1909
Three days after pitching a 1-0 shutout, Grover Cleveland Alexander of the
Galesburg (IL) Boosters, tosses a no-hitter against Pekin. He strikes out
10 and walks one. On the 26th he will beat Macon, 1-0, in 18 innings. In
that game he doesn't allow a hit until the 10th inning.

1910
The Giants jump on Cardinal rookie Ed Zmich for 5 runs in the first 3
innings and win easily, 9-2.

Connie Mack trades Morrie Rath and $5,000 to Cleveland for Bris Lord, a
former A's OF, and Pelican OF Joe Jackson. The key is OF Joe Jackson, of
the New Orleans club, who Mack wanted from Cleveland. When Francis Richter
in Philadelphia writes, "Mack ... on Saturday [the 23rd] made a splendid
deal with Cleveland by trading third baseman Rath for outfielder Brisco
Lord" he fails to mention Jackson. This trade is often listed as July 25,
and even August 1, though Rath plays his first game for Cleveland on July
28. Cleveland will be comfortable enough at first with Rath to release
vet 1B Bill Bradley, but Rath gets released to Baltimore (Eastern) in late
August. He'll return with the White Sox and the Reds.

1912
In Boston, Smoky Joe Wood (20-4) pitches Boston to a 6-3 win over
Cleveland. He allows 9 hits while striking out 7.

Iron Man McGinnity is still pitching doubleheaders, winning a pair of games
for Newark against Rochester (International League) at age 41.

1914
Lefty Tyler follows suit, stopping the Pirates, 2-0, as the Braves take 4
out of 5 in Pittsburgh.

1915
In the first of two at the Polo Grounds, Pittsburgh's Doc Johnston clouts a
3-run homer in the 3rd, off Mathewson, to lead the Pirates to a 6-1 win. The
Bucs take the nitecap as well, 4-3.

1917
The Cubs sweep a doubleheader with Brooklyn on two shutouts. Grover Alexander
wins the opener, 3-0, and Phil Douglas shuffles in to take the nitecap, 6-0.

The White Sox defeat the Red Sox, 5-3, behind the hitting of Happy Felsch,
who has 4 hits including a double and a triple. Chicago leads by 4 1/2 games.

1919
Grover Alexander and Shufflin' Phil Douglas combine to whitewash Brooklyn
twice, Alex winning, 3-0 in extra innings, and Douglas, 6-0. New Cubs
President Bill Veeck will reward Douglas by Shuffling him off to the Giants
on the 25th for slugger Dave Robertson, co-NL homerun leader in 1916 and
1917. Robertson, who was in government service last season, played just a
game with the Giants this year and refused to remain with the team after
a pre-season deal with the Nats fell through. He will hit zero homers for
the Cubs.

1922
When umpires Brick Owens and Tom Connolly miss a train, the Detroit and
St. Louis trainers, Bits Bierhalter and Howley, are pressed into service.

The Yankees start planning for the World Series when they pick up 3B Joe
Dugan and one-time Cleveland WS hero Elmer Smith from Boston, giving up
OF Elmer Miller, SS Chick Fewster, SS John Mitchell, and, later, P Lefty
O'Doul. The contending Browns and other western clubs howl in protest and
this deal will lead to a rule barring nonwaiver trades after June 15th.

Edd Roush ends his holdout and signs with the Reds.

Cubs 1B Ray Grimes homers in Chicago's 4-1 win over the Dodgers, giving
him at least one RBI per game for 17 in a row, a ML record. He'll fail to
drive in a run on the 25th against Boston. Grimes will hit .354 and drive
in 99 runs for the year.

1923
At Pittsburgh, the Cubs score 9 runs in the top of the 12th to beat the
Pirates, 12-3. The 9 runs is a NL record for the inning. Otto Vogel's 3-run
triple is the big blow in the scoring spree.

1925
In a Class C Western Association minor league game against the Topeka
Jayhawks, Paul Richards of the Muskogee Chiefs is summoned from his shortstop
position to pitch. The future major league player and manager throws with
both hands during his brief appearance on the mound, including an unusual
confrontation with a switch-hitter, that briefly results in both the pitcher
and the batter continually swapping hands and batter's boxes respectively,
until the ambidextrous hurler becomes a left-hander and right-hander on
alternate pitches, regardless of where the batter places himself.

With an assist from the Yankees, the A's seesaw back into first with a 5-4
win over the Red Sox.

The Yankees and Lou Gehrig, who hits the first of his ML-record 23 grand
slams, beat Firpo Marberry and the Senators, 11-7. Gehrig's slam is a fly
ball in the 7th that LF Goose Goslin thinks will drift foul, but it drops
fair and bounds into the seats scoring Ward, Meusel and Ruth. The bounce
homer is good for 4 runs, and Gehrig also hits a 2-run homer in the 5th.

A Pittsburgh 3-2 win over St. Louis and a Giants split with the Phils lifts
the Pirates back on top.

1926
Detroit and Washington take the unheard of time of 2 hours and 40 minutes
to play 9 innings. Detroit's 19 hits give them a 9-6 win, but much of the
time is consumed by manager Ty Cobb's arguing over a balk call, then trying
to have a heckling fan removed from the stands.

1928
In Boston, the Yanks lose to the Red Sox, 8-3, despite Babe Ruth's 40th
homer. Ruth's homer clears the left-centerfield wall, some 450 feet from
home, and is the first ball to clear that part of Fenway. Ruth, who adds
a double against Danny MacFayden, is now 28 games ahead of last year's
homerun pace. Al Shealy takes the loss for New York.

1929
The Athletics split with the visiting Indians, winning 4-1 before losing
9-3. Rube Walberg wins his 13th in the opener, beating Willis Hudlin. Mickey
Cochrane (#22) and Al Simmons bang homers. In the nitecap, Wes Ferrell
is the winner over ancient Jack Quinn. The high point for the A's comes
when Jimmy Foxx clouts a drive over the double-deck roof in LF, one of the
longest homers hit at Shibe Park.

Pete Alexander pitches the Cards to a 5-2 win over the Phillies, allowing
10 hits and fanning 7. The Cardinals decide they made a mistake when they
sent manager Bill McKechnie to Rochester and brought up Billy Southworth;
they swap them back again.

The Robins outslug the Pirates to win 10-7. In the 7th, Carmen Hill
intentionally passes Del Bissonette to pitch to Billy Rhiel, who promptly
belts a grand slam. Paul Waner lines an inside-the-park homer, while Babe
Herman is 2 for 5 to keep his average at .395. Doug McWeeny is the winning
pitcher.

1930
Pie Traynor of the Pirates is responsible for two victories over the Phillies
at the Baker Bowl. His HR in the 9th off Roy Hansen seals the first game,
2-1, for Heine Meine. He comes through one mo' time in the nitecap going 5
for 7 with a 3-run HR in the 13th to win, 16-15. George Grantham scores 5
runs for the Bucs. Traynor's 13th-inning blast negates 27 hits by the Phils,
including two homers by Don Hurst, for a then-record-tying team total 48
total bases. The Phils knot the score in the 8th, 9th and 12th innings,
but fall short in the 13th.

1932
Cleveland P Wes Ferrell makes 10 assists in a 12-inning game, but loses to
the White Sox, 6-5. The record in both leagues is 12.

1933
The Cubs sweep a pair from the Phillies, winning 9-5 and 3-1. Harvey
Hendrick cracks a pinch grand slam in the 11th to win game 1. His homer to
RF follows an intentional walk to Grimm. The winner in game 2 is Pat Malone,
who stretches his winning streak over the Phils to 12 games beginning in
May of 1931.

The Yanks win a pair from Cleveland by identical 8-1 scores. The Yankees
have now played 301 games without being shut out.

Detroit, down 6-2, scores 9 runs in the 8th to beat Washington, 12-8. The
loss drops the Senators into 2nd place.

Los Angeles (PCL) hitter Jim Oglesby has his 44-game consecutive game hit
streak stopped by Oakalnd's Roy Joiner in an 11-inning 2-1 win for the
Oaks. Oglesby is 0 for 5.

1935
Paul Dean puts the Cards in first place with a win in the opener of a
doubleheader with the Giants. The Giants regain the NL lead in the nightcap
with an 8-2 win.

San Francisco (PCL) beats Mission pitcher Boom Boom Beck, 2-1, but he stops
young Joe DiMaggio's hit streak at 27 straight games. Joe is 0 for 4.

1936
The White Sox edge the Nationals, 7-6, for their 17th win in 21 games. Vern
Kennedy wins his 9th straight when he drives home the winner with an
8th-inning double against Bobo Newsom. Luke Appling is 2 for 4 to keep his
Al-leading batting average at .382.

Before a paying crowd of 1,932 at Ebbets Field, Joe Stripp bangs a 9th-inning
double to give the Dodgers a 6-5 win over the Cubs.

1938
Chicago's Dizzy Dean outpitches Hal Schumacher to give the Cubs a 3-1 win
over the Giants. In a rundown play, Cubs SS Billy Jurges crashes into 2B
Dick Bartell and the two roll around kicking and punching.

1939
In a 16-3 Tigers rout at Briggs Stadium, A's catcher Harry O'Neill appears
in his only major league game. In 1945, the 22-year-old backstop will die
in combat on Iwo Jima becoming one of only two big leaguers to be killed
in World War II.

The Dodgers use the new yellow-colored baseball again at Ebbets Field, but the
Cardinals see it better while winning two, 12-0 and 8-2. The experimenting
with use of the color sphere, which is designed to make the ball easier to
see for the players and the fans, started in Brooklyn last week and will
be tested once more, in a September game played at Wrigley Field.

1940
Commissioner Landis rules that Red Sox farmhand Larry Jansen is a free
agent and the Judge fines Boston $500 for its mishandling of Jansen's
contract. Jansen won't arrive in the majors until 1947 but will be 21-5 in
his rookie year with the Giants.

The Reds sweep their 10th doubleheader of the year, beating the Dodgers,
4-3 in 11 innings and 9-2. The first game is marked by a huge brawl in the
8th inning as Reese and Frey get into it after a hard slide at 2B. Frey
and Coscarart get chased and Reds P Junior Thompson leaves after getting
spiked in the fight. Whit Wyatt, who was injured last year in a collision
with Frey, wails on him with a glove and will get fined $25 for it. The
brawl is bigger than the one in Chicago 4 days earlier.

The Dodgers buy Pete Reiser from Montreal.

1941
After 11 straight wins, Elmer Riddle loses to the Dodgers, 5-4. The Reds
give Elmer a 4-run lead, off Higbe, but he fails to hold it. Frank McCormick
is beaned by Higbe and taken off the field on a stretcher. McCormick has
played 349 straight games.

Dick Wakefield, University of Michigan star, plays his first pro game,
going 0 for 4 with 3 strikeouts for Winston Salem. Wakefield was signed by
the Tigers for $52,000 and a car. He'll get into seven ML games in 1941,
hitting just .143.

1942
After giving up a lead-off bloop single, Newark Eagles Leon Day strikes
out 18 Baltimore Elite Giants to set a Negro League record.

1943
Boston 2B Bobby Doerr drops an Appling pop fly, for the first error in
349 chances over 59 games. Chicago tops the Red Sox, 8-6, with Orval Grove
winning his 9th straight.

Outfielders Luis Olmo, Augie Galan and Frenchy Bordagaray of the Dodgers
account for a record 18 putouts in a game against Cincinnati. Whitlow Wyatt
is the Dodger pitcher, winning 2-0, on 4 hits.

1944
After hitting 4 consecutive HRs in two games (one in his last at-bat
yesterday, and three in the opener today, a 7-4 Cubs win over the Giants),
Bill Nicholson of the Cubs is given the ultimate compliment. He comes to bat
with the Cubs down 10-7 in the 8th of game 2 with the Giants and is given
an intentional walk forcing in a run. The strategy backfires as the Cubs
tie the score at 10-10, but the Giants score twice in their half of the 8th
with Joe Medwick driving home the winner. The Giants win, 12-10. Nicholson
has hit 6 HRs within 48 hours (one on Friday night, one on Saturday, and
the 4 today). Nicholson is the first batter since Ott and Lajoie to get
a bases-loaded free pass. Nicholson and Mel Ott, who homered in game one,
are tied for the NL lead with 23 homers. Each team uses seven pitchers in
the slugfest; the 14 hurlers is a ML record.

1947
Ralph Kiner hits HRs 24 and 25, breaking the Pirate record of 23 by Johnny
Rizzo in 1938 and tied by rookie Kiner last year. Behind HR king Johnny
Mize 14 to 3 at the end of May, Kiner will have 25 to Mize's 31 by the end
of July. The Pirates defeat the Phils, 6-2.

Washington's Ray Scarborough celebrates his 30th birthday by shutting out
the Tigers, 6-0. He also stops Bengal first baseman Roy Cullenbine's streak
of 22 consecutive games in which he was walked, a ML record that started
on July 2nd. The switch-hitting Cullenbine will walk 137 times this season,
a Detroit team record. But he'll collect just 104 hits in compiling a .224
average, and Detroit will let him go, ending his career.

1948
After missing 15 games with a torn rib cartilage, Ted Williams is 2 for 4
to help the Red Sox down the White Sox, 13-1. Bobby Doerr collects his 18th
homer and adds a double and a single to back Mickey Harris. Boston has now
won nine straight to pull within a game and a half of the first-place Indians.

Larry Jansen's 5-hitter gives the Giants a 5-0 win over the Cubs. John Mize's
first-inning homer off Russ Meyer provides all the scoring the Giants need.

1949
In the Cards' 3-1 win over the Dodgers, St. Louis rookie 3B Eddie Kazak
fractures his ankle and will miss the rest of the season. The palindromic
young star, a starter in the All-Star game, is hitting .304. Kazak will
never be a starter again.

1950
Tigers P Saul Rogovin hits a 2nd-inning grand slam off Yankees P Eddie
Lopat as the first-place Bengals nip the onrushing New York Yankees, 6-5.

Sheldon Jones of the NY Giants pitches a one-hitter against the Cubs,
winning 3-0 in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. Rube Walker's hit in the
8th is the only safety. Larry Jansen takes the first, 5-3.

1951
At Cooperstown, the Dodgers rally to beat the A's, 9-5, in the 10th annual
Hall of Fame game.

1953
The Browns give up on Bobo Holloman, selling the no-hit rookie to Toronto
(IL). He'll never appear in the majors again, and his 3 wins are the fewest
by a no-hit pitcher since 1900.

1955
LF Del Ennis of the Phillies hits 3 HRs and drives in all 7 runs - one
short of Georgy Kelly's NL mark set in 1924 - as the Phils beat the Cards,
7-2. Robin Roberts wins his 16th and 6th in a row.

In the 9th inning at Kansas City, New York Yankees pinch hitter Bob Cerv
homers off Alex Kellner and teammate Elston Howard immedately follows with
a pinch homer off Tom Gorman. The two pinch homers in the same inning by
teammates is a major league first. Howard's homerun ties the game, but the
Kansas City Athletics win in 11 innings, 8-7.

1956
Joe Cronin and Hank Greenberg are officially inducted into the Hall of Fame
at Cooperstown, NY.

1957
Before 42,422 at Yankee Stadium, Mickey Mantle hits for the cycle, the
first in the AL since 1952, and adds a stolen base, against Chicago's Bob
Keegan. His homer is a 465-foot clout into the second-to-last row in the
right-center bleachers. The Yankees win, 10-6. Bobby Murcer in 1972 will
be the next Yankee to cycle.

At Wrigley, the Cubs' 20-year-old flame-thrower Dick Drott fans 14 enroute
to a 4-0 shutout of the Giants.

1958
Dodger Norm Larker hits a ball just inside the 1B line, which the Pirates
believe to be foul. When umpire Vic Delmore signals it fair, P Bob Porterfield
picks up the ball from where it had rolled into the bullpen. Though
not playing, Porterfield is ejected for intentional interference with a
ball in play. Larker is safe on 2B. The Dodgers still lose, 11-3, in the
doubleheader opener and are now in last place. Bob Friend wins his 12th in
the nitecap, 6-3.

In Detroit, the Yankees finally defeat Frank Lary, beating up on the Tigers,
16-4. It's their first win in '58 against Lary after 5 losses. Berra and
Mantle hit back-to-back homers in the 9th off reliever Bill Fischer. Art
Ditmar has 3 hits and wins his 6th against a loss.

The Sawyer-led Phils sweep a pair from the Giants, winning 3-2 and 2-0. Harry
Anderson clubs a three-run homer to help Robin Roberts win a suspended
game, and rookie Ray Semproch shuts out the Giants, knocking them out of
the NL lead.

The Braves regain first place on Joey Jay's 2-hit 6-0 win over the
Cards. Eddie Mathews' 3-run homer supplies the Braves' punch.

1959
With Ty Cobb in the stands, the Tigers make 15 hits to beat the Senators,
11-2. Harvey Kuenn, the AL's leading hitter, is 4 for 4 and scores 4
runs. Bunning allows 4 hits to win.

1960
During an 8-3 loss to the Senators, A's outfielder Whitey Herzog hits into
a triple play as his line drive is snagged on the mound by Pedro Ramos,
who tosses it first baseman Julio Becquer to double up the runner, and
the third out of the play is made by relaying the ball to shortstop Jose
Valdivielso getting the runner at second base. It is the first all Cuban
triple play in major league history. Reliever Chuck Stobbs (7-2) gets the
win. Killebrew has a 2-run homer.

In an effort to distract Ted Williams during his at-bats in the 6th and 8th
innings, the Indians CF Jimmy Piersall goes into a war dance. Piersall gets
tossed for his efforts (after ignoring warnings) and manager Joe Gordon is
also ejected for arguing Jimmy's case. The Indians' center fielder charges
the umpire after being tossed and has to be restrained by teammates. It is
Piersall's 6th ejection of the season. Gordon had previously announced that
any more ejections would cost Piersall $500 each, but he thinks today's
thumbing is unwarranted and waives the fine. AL president Joe Cronin is
less forgiving and fines Piersall $100. The Indians win, 4-2, behind Jim
Perry's pitching and the first ML HR of Mike de la Hoz.

1961
Using 21 pitchers, the Tigers (11) and A's (10) set an AL record for most
hurlers used in an 18-inning doubleheader. At 3 hours 54 minutes, the 2nd
game is the longest 9-inning contest in AL history. The entire doubleheader
lasts 6 hours 50 minutes, a ML record. The Tigers sweep, 6-4 and 17-14,
taking first place by one percentage point.

1962
Jackie Robinson becomes the first black player to be inducted into the
Hall of Fame. Joining the Dodger infielder in the Cooperstown ceremony are
fireballer Bob Feller, veteran manager Bill McKechnie and outfielder Ed Roush.

At Cincinnati, Reds pitcher Jim O'Toole loses his no-hit bid when Bob
Skinner doubles in the 8th inning. O'Toole finishes with a 3-0 one-hitter
against the Pirates.

1963
At Wrigley, Jim Maloney pitches a one-hitter as the Reds edge the Cubs,
1-0. Ellis Burton's single in the first inning is the only hit for Chicago.

1964
A's rookie Bert Campaneris sends Minnesota to defeat 4-3 with 2 HRs in his
ML debut. The first comes on the first pitch thrown to him, by Jim Kaat,
just the 2nd AL player to debut like that. And the 21-year-old Cuban joins
Bob Nieman as the only player since 1900 with 2 HRs in his first ML game.

1965
In a 5-1 win over the Mets, Phillies first baseman Dick Stuart homers at
Shea Stadium becoming the first player to have gone deep in 23 major league
ballparks. His park mark will be topped.

1966
Bob Allison of the Twins suffers a broken left hand when hit by a Jim
Lonborg pitch during Minnesota's 10-4 win over the Red Sox.

At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks celebrate Old-Timers' Day but lose to the Angels,
7-6, despite a grand slam from Mickey Mantle. The slam, off Marcelino Lopez,
is Mickey's 9th. He ties Babe Ruth - not in homeruns, but in games played
as a Yankee.

1967
The Red Sox sweep a doubleheader from the Indians, to run Boston's win
streak to 10 games, all on the road. The Sox are now a half-game behind
1st-place Chicago. At Logan Airport 10,000 fans are on hand to greet the
Sox when they return.

At Chicago, the Giants are 5-3 winners in game 1 as Mike McCormick tops
Fergie Jenkins. Jesus Alou hits his 2nd homer in 3 weeks off Jenkins.

Sox manager during his 36-game absence.

1969
Willie McCovey hits 2 HRs as the NL beats the AL, 9-3, for its 7th straight
All-Star Game win. Mel Stottlemyre starts for the AL when Denny McLain is
late arriving from a dental appointment.

1970
At Wrigley, Milt Pappas shuts out the Reds in a Cubs' 1-0 win. It is the only
shutout of the year against the Reds, tying the NL record. Jim McGlothlin
takes the loss.

1971
Pat Dobson (13-4) wins his 10th straight for the Orioles, beating California,
4-3.

Catfish Hunter is knocked out in the 7th inning, but before he exits he
drives in 4 runs as Oakland beats Detroit and Mickey Lolich, 9-7. Sal Bando
has 2 homers, while the Tigers hit 4.

1974
At Three River Stadium, Dodger first baseman Steve Garvey (the game MVP),
a write-in All-Star starter, singles and doubles to help the National
League beat the Junior circuit, 7-2. Mike Schmidt, also a write-in, plays
in his first Midsummer Classic thanks to radio intern Howard Eskin's on-air
campaign which urged Phillies fans to stuff the ballot box for their young
third baseman. Atlanta's Ralph Garr goes into the All-Star break with 149
hits, the most this century (starting in 1933) before the break. He'll end
with 214 hits.

1975
At Three Rivers Stadium, Frank Taveras is picked off first base in an unusual
play. After getting a big lead, to get a good jump on a sac bunt, the Pirates
shortstop is picked off when the catcher throws the ball to first base with
Phillies right fielder Jay Johnstone covering the base to complete 2-9 play.

Willie Crawford and Lee Lacy connect for 9th-inning back-to-back pinch HRs
off Bob Forsch, but the Dodgers lose anyway, 5-4, to the Cardinals. They
are the 2nd pair of Dodgers to pinch hit back-to-back homers.

1976
Tying an American League record, Orioles outfielder Reggie Jackson hits a
homerun in six consecutive games. The round tripper does not help when the
Birds bow to the Brewers in Baltimore, 4-3.

Joining Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron, Sadaharu Oh becomes the third professional
to hit 700 homeruns. The 33-year-old Yomiuri Giants slugger, who will finish
his career with 868 career homers, is the first player to accomplish the
feat in Japan.

The Angels fire manager Dick Williams. Norm Sherry takes over the reins.

1977
Paul Blair hits a 9th inning 3-run homer to give the Yankees' Ron Guidry
a 3-1 victory over the Brewers.

1978
Reggie Jackson returns to the team and the Yankees win their 5th straight,
3-1, over the White Sox. At the Chicago airport, Martin, reacting to
reporters' questions about Jackson and Steinbrenner, replies, "The two
deserve each other. One's a born liar; the other's convicted." The remarks
will cost Billy his job.

1979
At Wrigley, the Reds and Cubs complete a game suspended on May 10th because
the Cubs had to catch a plane. That contest was tied 7-7 after 9 innings. Both
teams score in the 11th and the Cubs win in the 18th on a run scoring single
by Steve Ontiveros. The Cubs then win the regularly scheduled game, 2-1,
with Willie Hernandez getting the victory. Dave Kingman hits a 2-run homer
in the bottom of the 9th for the win.

Phil Niekro throws a 2-hitter as Atlanta beats the Pirates, 8-0. The score
might've been higher but the Bucs pull off a triple play - Madlock to Garner
to Stargell. It is the 500th triple play in ML history.

1984
Angels Mike Witt strikes out 16 Mariners in a 7-1 victory.

1985
Oddibe McDowell becomes the first Ranger player to hit for the cycle. His
seventh inning homerun completes the unique event, but the center fielder
adds another round tripper in the following frame when Texas beats the
Indians at Arlington Stadium, 8-4. McDowell goes 5 for 5 in the game.

1986
In Toronto's 6-2 win at Seattle, Tony Fernandez hits a single in the 7th.
The play ends up with five players touching the ball a total of eight times
and the catcher getting the put out at second. Retrosheet's John Jarvis
calls this the longest putout string he's recorded.

1987

and promote slugger Sam Horn from Pawtucket. The Angels will sign Buckner
and he will hit .306 in 57 games.

1989
The Cubs remain in last-place but beat the Giants, 9-5, for their 8th
straight win. Greg Maddux (10-8) wins with the help of Andre Dawson's 3-run
homer and 3 runs scored by Ryne Sandberg. The streak ends here.

1991
Texas' Nolan Ryan notches his 308th career win in a 5-4 victory over the
Red Sox and Rich Gossage garners his 308th career save in relief. The game
marked Ryan's 545th consecutive start, surpassing Steve Carlton's major
league record.

During an 8-5 Chicago win, Cincinnati P Rob Dibble throws a ball at Cubs OF
Doug Dascenzo as Dascenzo runs to 1B. Dibble is fined by the league office,
but not suspended. Cubs OF Andre Dawson bumps umpire Joe West and will be
suspended for one game and fined $1,000.

1992
White Sox C Carlton Fisk hits a triple in Chicago's 6-2 win over the
Brewers. He becomes the oldest player to hit a triple at age 44 since Pete
Rose hit 2 in 1986 at age 45.

1993
At San Francisco, Barry Bonds hits a homer in the 9th off the Phils' Curt
Schilling to tie the game, 1-1. Jim Eisenreich's homer in the 4th had been
the game's only score. Hollins finally scores in the 14th to give the Phils
a 2-1 victory.

1995

Cincinnati runs on 2 HRs.

The Pirates trade P Danny Darwin to the Astros in exchange for minor league
P Rich Loiselle.

At the Astrodome, San Diego's Rob Deer launches one of the highest balls
ever hit, striking a cable holding up a loud speaker. It's declared a dead
ball. The Pads don't need it as they win, 7-4.

In the pitchers' hell known as Coors Field, the Rockies take a pair from
the Mets, outslugging them 10-7 and 11-10. The two games feature 59 hits,
including 8 HRs, off 17 pitchers. In the first inning of the nitecap, Dante
Bichette, Andres Galarraga and Vinny Castilla hit consecutive homers off Pete
Harnisch. Galarraga hits another in the 3rd, one of his 6 hits for the day.

1998
Baltimore C Lenny Webster's 4 hits - including a double and a homer -
and 6 ribbies power the Orioles to a 9-7 win over Oakland.

Following the Giants' 2-11 mark since the All-Star break, San Francisco picks
up Joe Carter from Baltimore and Jose Mesa, Al Morman and Shawon Dunston from
the Indians. The Giants send 33-year-old (he'll later reveal he's 34) Steve
Reed (1.48 ERA in 50 appearances) and minor leaguer Jacob Cruz to Cleveland,
and Darin Blood to Baltimore. The Giants receive cash in both swaps.

1999
The Mets obtain P Kenny Rogers from the Athletics for OF Terrence Long and
P Leoner Vasquez.

The Pirates obtain C Joe Oliver and C Humberto Cota from the Devil Rays
for OF Jose Guillen and P Jeff Sparks. Guillen, who drove in 154 runs in
his first 2 seasons, has been sub-par this year after arriving at spring
training a month late due to visa problems.

2000
Joining his grandfather and his father, Reds third baseman Mike Bell becomes
part of the first three-generation family to play for the same team. Gus
played for Cincinnati from 1953 to 1961 and his son spent the 1987-88
seasons in the Queen City.

The Astros hit four homers in one inning off Cardinal hurler Andy Benes
tying the major league record for round-trippers allowed by one pitcher in a
single frame. The second inning uprising helps Houston set a team record for
homers in one inning and ties a team record with six big flies for the game.

After rejecting a trade to the Mets, Reds All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin
agrees to a three-year $27 million contract extension that will keep him
in Cincinnati until 2003.

The Big Red Machine rolls into Cooperstown delivering first baseman Tony
Perez, manager Sparky Anderson and Reds announcer Marty Brennaman into the
Baseball Hall of Fame along with 1975 Red Sox World Series rival Carlton
Fisk. Also enshrined are 19th century Cincinnati second baseman Bid McPhee
and Negro League star 'Turkey' Stearnes.

The Astros defeat the Cardinals, 15-7, hitting a record-tying 4 HRs off
Andy Benes in the 2nd inning, and 6 homers all told. Benes is the 17th
pitcher to surrender 4 homers in a single frame, and the 2nd his year.

Behind Pedro, the Red Sox defeat the White Sox, 1-0. Martinez goes the
distance, striking out 15 and not walking a batter.

2001
The Indians defeat the White Sox, 2-0, as C.C. Sabathia becomes the youngest
pitcher to win 10 games in the majors since Edwin Correa did so for the
1986 Texas Rangers.

2002
Celebrating his 29th birthday by hitting three homers in Boston's 22-4
rout of the Devil Rays in the first game of a day-night doubleheader,
Nomar Garciaparra ties the major league record becoming the 26th player
to hit five homeruns in two games. It was the Red Sox shortstop's second
three-homer game, having accomplished the feat against the Mariners on May 10,
1999. Today Garciaparra establishes the record for consecutive homeruns in
the shortest time in terms of innings by homering three times in two frames -
two two-run homers in the second and a grand slam in the third. Garciaparra
also drives in 8 runs today. Boston scores 10 runs in the 3rd inning to
break the game open. Tampa Bay comes back to take the second game, 5-4.

The Reds obtain P Brian Moehler and IF Matt Boone from the Tigers in exchange
for IF David Espinosa and two players to be named. Moehler, 1-1 with a 2.29
ERA, will go 2-4 with a 6.02 ERA as a Red.

The Dodgers get IF Tyler Houston from the Brewers in exchange for pitchers
Ben Diggins and Shane Nance.

2003
The Yankees top the Orioles, 4-2, as Andy Pettitte wins his 7th straight
game. Pettitte becomes the first pitcher to win 12 games in each of his
first 9 seasons since Stan Coveleski turned the trick (1916-26).

2005
At SBC Park, uniform number 36 is added to the second deck of the left field
bleachers joining nine others as the Giants honor Gaylord Perry. The Hall of
Famer, who won 134 of his 314 career victories with San Francisco, remembers
his 37-year-old son, Jack, who died last month of complications from leukemia.

The Padres obtain 3B Joe Randa from the Reds. In return, the Padres send
pitchers Justin Germano and Travis Chick to the Reds.

2006
In a 3-1 victory over the Indians at Jacobs Field, Francisco Liriano
and four Twins relievers establish a club record with 17 strikeouts in a
nine-inning game. The Minnesota starter reached double-digit whiffs (10)
for the third time this season with Pat Neshek, Dennys Reyes, Juan Rincon
and Joe Nathan adding seven more punch outs over the last four innings.

Adrian Beltre hits the first inside-the-park homerun in the eight-year
history of Safeco Field. The eighth-inning blast to centerfield comes off
Mike Timlin in the Mariners' 9-8 victory over Boston.

Jered Weaver becomes the first rookie in 25 years to win his first 7 starts
as he leads the Angels to a 3-1 victory over the Royals.

a 9-inning game by having 17 batters strike out.

In a slugfest at Angels Stadium, Los Angeles collects a season-high 19 hits
beating the Indians, 14-11. The hit parade is lead by Howie Kendrick (4),
Jeff Mathis (4) and Casey Kotchman (5) making it the first time in franchise
history three different players have had four or more hits in the same game.

2009
Thanks to a spectacular grab of Gabe Kapler's bid for a leadoff homerun in
the ninth inning by defensive replacement DeWayne Wise, Mark Buehrle tosses
the 18th perfect game in major league history, a 5-0 gem over the Rays at
U.S. Cellular Field. The 30-year-old southpaw, who received a congratulatory
call from President Obama, a big White Sox fan, becomes the second pitcher
in franchise history to throw two hitless games for the team, matching Frank
Smith's accomplishment when the right-hander did it against the 1905 Tigers
and the 1908 A's.

2011
For the first time in the 50-year history of the franchise, the Mets compile
a 50-50 won-loss record after playing one hundred games. New York achieves
the dubious distinction when they lose in Florida, 8-5.

The Mariners tie the 1992 franchise record for consecutive defeats by losing
to the Red Sox at Fenway Park, 3-1. Seattle's 14th straight loss results
in Boston's skipper Terry Francona's 1,000th win as a major league manager.

2013
Wearing their home whites and batting in the bottom of the innings, the Reds
drop a 5-3 decision to the Giants in the second game of a twin bill at San
Francisco's AT&T Park, the make-up game of a washout of a July Fourth contest
that could not be rescheduled to be played Cincinnati. The Reds would have
been the first team in major league history to produce a walkoff win on the
road had they come back from their two-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth.

2017
Zach Britton of the Orioles set the American League record for most
consecutive saves converted by closing out the Houston Astros for his 55th
in a row.
