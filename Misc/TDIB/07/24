1901
In a baseball rarity, the Pittsburgh Pirates score in every inning, a ML
record of course, defeating the Reds 11-2. Deacon Phillippe is the winner
over Tannehill.

Milwaukee's Pink Hawley beats Boston, 4-3, and beans C Lou Criger with a
pitch. Criger is unconscious for 5 minutes before being taken away. Ossee
Schreckengost moves from 1B to C and Dowd moves to 1B.

1902
At Washington Park, the Giants win their 2nd in a row under McGraw,
beating Brooklyn, 2-0. Christy Mathewson strikes out 11 to even his
record at 8-8. Matty will top Brooklyn by the same score on the 28th,
in a rain-shortened game.

1903
At the Baker Bowl, Bill Duggleby holds the Giants to 5 hits and the Phils
hand Mathewson his 2nd loss in 4 days, winning 3-0.

1905
Giant LF Sam Mertes makes an unassisted double play to help New York stop
the Reds, 4-3, at the Polo Grounds. In the 2nd inning, the Reds have one
out and a runner on 3rd, outfielder Cy Seymour, once a wild pitcher for
the Giants. Mertes catches a short fly off the bat of George Schlei and
continues running to double off Cy.

Detroit and Boston play their 2nd straight game in Columbus, Ohio. Boston
won yesterday, 6-1, behind Cy Young, and today Boston wins again, 7-1. Bill
Dinneen is victorious over Detroit workhorse George Mullin. Boston 2B Hobe
Ferris was 3 for 4 yesterday, and today chips in with a homer.

1908
At the Polo Grounds, the Giants edge the visiting Pirates, 2-1, behind Hooks
Wiltse. Larry Doyle leads the offense with a single, double and RBI triple.

1909
At Washington Park, the Superbas (Dodgers) sweep a twin bill from the visiting
Cardinals with identical 1-0 scores. Brooklyn's southpaw Nap Rucker strikes
out 16 Redbirds in one of the contests. Rucker will fan 201 batters this
year, just 4 behind Orval Overall, the NL leader.

1910
The Giants drop the Cardinals again, winning 4-1 to finish 7-9 on their
western swing.

1911
At the Palace of the Fans in Cincinnati, the Giants establish a club mark
hitting four triples in one game. The plethora of three-baggers, including
two legged out by Hall of Fame hurler Rube Marquard as well as one each
from Larry Doyle and Chief Meyers, and nine other hits enable New York to
beat the Reds, 8-3.

An AL All-Star team plays the Naps in Cleveland, raising $12,914 for the
late Addie Joss' family. The All-Stars win 5-3. Joe Wood and Walter Johnson
pitch for the All-Stars, while Cy Young twirls for the Naps.

Rochester and Newark of the Eastern League play a doubleheader in 2 hours
32 minutes.

At Pittsburgh, Owen Wilson legs out three triples in an 8-2 win over
Brooklyn. Pittsburgh is in 5th place (86-48) but just 4 1/2 games out
of first.

1915
In the 9th inning of game 2 of a twinbill with Cleveland, the A's Nap Lajoie
lines into a triple play against Sam Jones to end the game (as noted by
Jim Smith and Herm Krabbenhoft).

1916
In Toronto, the Red Sox play a 5-5 exhibition tie with the Toronto (IL) Maple
Leafs. With Canada at war in Europe, two Sox players of German extraction
react to possible fan reaction; 1B Dick Hobitzell sits the game out while
Heine Wagner plays under the name Richardson.

1919
At Fenway, Ruth is twice intentionally walked by Yank pitcher Bob Shawkey
with runners on. But in the 8th, with a one run lead he gives up a single
to Braggo Roth and pitches to Babe who hits his 15th homer. Sox win, 4-2.

1920
After losing 3 in a row, Cleveland salvages a win against New York by scoring
2 runs in the 11th inning to win 4-2. Both Yankee runs come on solo homers
by Meusel and Ruth. Ruth, who hit his 34th homerun to give the Yanks a
temporary 2-1 lead, moves to 1B in the 8th to take over for Wally Pipp,
who was ejected. Ruth's high throw on a grounder allows Cleveland's Ray
Chapman to reach base safely, and he and Joe Wood score on a Gardner triple
that eludes Meusel. Jim Bagby is the winner. Cleveland leaves New York with
a slim lead over the Yanks.

At St. Louis, the Cards beat the Braves, 7-6, in 10 innings. After Dillhoefer
triples to lead off the bottom of the 10th, Heathcote and McHenry are
purposely passed. An out later, Jack Smith hits a drive to CF that would've
been a homer had more than a single been needed to drive in the winner.

1921
Walter Johnson gives up 6 runs to Detroit but Washington scores 14 to makes
his win an easy one. Harry Heilmann is 4 for 4 with 3 doubles for the losers.

The Phils lose to the Giants, 4-3, in New York as George Kelly drives in
all 4 Giant runs. Goldie Rapp is 2 for 4, his 17th straight game in which
he's garnered a hit. Off the field, the Phils do some housecleaning. They
fire manager Wild Bill Donovan (25-62 this year) and replace him with
Kaiser Wilhelm. Phils owner William Baker accuses Donovan of "knowing a
little too much" about the Black Sox scandal after Donovan testified at
the trial. Landis will order Baker to apologize and will send a letter to
Donovan exonerating him of any responsibility in the scandal. Also moving
is OF Irish Meusel, who is traded to the Giants for C Butch Henline, OF
Curt Walker, P Jesse Winters and cash. Batting cleanup, Meusel will drive
in more than 100 runs a year in 1922-25 while Walker will lead the Phils
in 6 offensive categories in 1922. This year, Irish will become the first
player to collect 200 hits in a season in which he was traded: only 5 other
players this century will accomplish this feat.

1922
In the midst of a pennant fight with the Browns, the Yankees obtain Joe
Dugan and OF Elmer Smith from the Red Sox for OF Chuck Fewster, SS John
Mitchell and OF Elmer Miller. This latest Sox-Yanks deal engenders such
outrage in St. Louis that Commissioner Landis recommends passage of the
rule that no deals, except waiver transactions, can be made after June 15.

1923
In Philadelphia, Yankee pitcher Carl Mays beats the Athletics, 9-2, for
his AL record 24th straight win over Philadelphia. (The record was listed
for years at 23 wins, but historian Lyle Spatz recalculated it at 24. This
matches the ML high of Christy Mathewson, who won 24 straight.) He started
with doubleheader victories on August 30, 1918 while pitching for the Red
Sox. The Yankees score 5 in the 8th and another 3 in the 9th on Ruth's
3-run homer, which lands on the roof of a house across 20th street. His
23rd homer ties the mark of Cy Williams.

At St. Louis, Cleveland's Jim Joe Edwards and the Browns' Ray Kolp face off
for 13 innings before Charlie Jamieson's leadoff HR in the 13th decides it,
3-2. Kolp faces 52 batters, at one point retiring 19 straight.

1926
Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth demonstrate that power hitting is not the only
thing they can do when Lou scores on a double steal with the Babe in a 7-4
victory over the White Sox. They had pulled the same double steal against
the Red Sox on April 13th.

1927
Off Tommy Thomas, Babe Ruth hits his first homer of the year at Comiskey
Park, as the Yankees edge the White Sox, 3-2. Ruth has now connected in
all 8 AL parks this year.

1928
The first-place Cards edge the Robins, 2-1, with both runs coming on solo
homers by Hafey and Bottomley. Wee Willie Sherdel wins against Jess Petty.

The Indians tally 35 hits and 25 runs in a double win over the Red Sox,
10-2 and 15-5. Johnny Hoddap has 4 hits in the nitecap and backup C Chick
Autry chips in with 5 safeties. Sox manager Carrigan finally pulls RF Doug
Taitt in to pitch the 9th inning.

1929
The Cubs regain the NL lead by beating the Giants in Chicago, 8-7; a
9-game winning streak gives them a 4 1/2 game lead. Today's win goes to
Mike Cvengros, who tops Fred Fitzsimmons. The Cubs offense is lead by Hack
Wilson's two homeruns.

The Yanks edge the Tigers, 7-5, behind the hitting of Bill Dickey. Dickey
has 4 hits, including a HR, to back Herb Pennock's pitching.

1930
The Cubs and Phils each bang out 17 hits, but the Cubs prevail 19-15. When
Chuck Klein objects sharply to an 8th-inning strike call by umpire Lou
Jorda he is banished for the first time in his career. Also ejected are
Phils manager Burt Shotton, captain Fresco Thompson and 1B Don Hurst. It is
necessary to use 42-year-old Cy Williams in RF in the 9th, the only inning
of play Klein will miss in 1930. With the win the Cubs (54-39) stay .007
behind Brooklyn, which divides a pair with the Reds.

Red Sox outfielder Earl Webb is 4 for 4 including a double and a homer,
to lead the Red Sox to an 8-5 win over the Browns. He also starts a double
play to back Reb Russell's pitching.

Despite the efforts of Chick Hafey, who goes 4 for 4 with 2 homers, the Braves
edge the Cards, 5-4. Bob Smith picks up the win over Jess Haines. Braves
rookie Wally Berger hits his 27th homer in going 4 for 4.

Jimmie Foxx clubs his 27th homer of the year, a 2-run shot in the 9th inning,
to give the first-place A's the victory, 8-6, over Cleveland. The drive, high
into the CF bleachers off Willis Hudlin, scores Mickey Cochrane. Earlier,
Cochrane hit his 22nd homer of the year to help Ed Rommel to the win.

In Detroit, the 3rd place Yankees beat the Tigers, 7-2. Ruth clouts his
36th homer to help Roy Sherid win over Guy Cantrell.

1931
Babe Herman hits for the cycle for the 2nd time this season (he did it
May 18th), but the Robins lose at Pittsburgh, 8-7. The Dodger outfielder
is one of only three men to hit for the cycle three times. Larry French,
in relief, stops a 9th-inning Brooklyn rally.

The Cards stretch their lead to 8 games by sweeping a pair from the Phillies,
10-0 and 7-2. Flint Rhem coasts in the lidlifter as the Cards collect 17
hits. Burleigh Grimes wins the nitecap.

1933
After leading the team to the National League pennant in 1930 and 1931,
skipper Gabby Street is fired mid-season by the Cardinals. Frank Frisch, the
Redbirds second baseman, is named as player-manager of the fifth-place club.

1934
In a 4-2 loss to the Browns, Yankee star CF Earle Combs (.319) crashes into
the wall at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and suffers a broken collarbone
and a fractured skull. New York calls up George Selkirk but learns he broke
his arm today playing for Newark. Combs will announce his retirement on
the 28th, but come back to play 89 games next season.

At Chicago, the White Sox top the Senators, 4-1, behind the 6-hit pitching
of Les Tietje. The only run for the Senators comes on a solo HR by Johnny
Gill. The temperature in Chicago today is 105 degrees, the highest ever
recorded in the city.

1935
Behind Chief Crowder, the Tigers beat the Yankees, 4-0, to go ahead by
one-half game, but are a fraction of a percentage point behind. Jo Jo White
leads off the game with his first ML homer, off Red Ruffing.

Carl Hubbell notches his first win over Dizzy Dean as the Giants edge the
Cards, 4-2.

1937
The Senators sweep a pair from the Browns, winning each by a 6-5 score. Pinch
hitter Wes Ferrell drives in the winning run in both games, hitting a sac
fly in game 1 and a single in game 2.

1939
The Detroit Tigers release oft-injured Dixie Walker. He signs with Brooklyn,
with whom he will have his most productive years.

1940
The Yankees (6) and Browns (5) tie a ML record for most pitchers in a
9-inning game. The Browns pound out a 14-12 win as Judnich hits a HR,
2 doubles and 2 singles. He had 2 homers in yesterday's win over NY. The
Yanks counter with homers by DiMaggio, Dickey, Gordon and Henrich.

1943
Browns pitcher Bobo Newsom is struck on the head by a liner off the bat of
Red Sox pitcher Oscar Judd. Bobby Doerr goes deep off Bobo, the 3rd straight
day that Doerr has homered.

1946
Bob Feller wins his 18th, stopping the A's on three hits, 1-0. Feller K's
nine to run his season total to 220. Hank Edwards' homer, off Bob Savage,
is the only score.

Scoring both runs in the first, the Dodgers top the Cubs, 2-1, and move
back into the NL lead. Rookie Joe Hatten is the winner as his teammates
dice Hank Wyse for 11 hits.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants drop the Cards out of first place when Johnny
Mize belts a 2-run homer in the bottom of the 9th. The Giants' Dave Koslo
wins, 3-1. He also scores the first run on a bases-loaded walk in the 2nd.

After being tied with the Cards for 5 days, the Dodgers take over undisputed
1st place with a 2-1 win over the Cubs. Joe Hatten is the winner.

Washington's well-traveled Bobo Newsom stops Detroit's Dizzy Trout, 1-0,
handing Trout his 5th shutout loss of the year. Cecil Travis' single scores
Stan Spence, who has a 4 for 4 afternoon.

The Reds' Bucky Walters wins his 6th straight, stopping Boston, 2-1. The
Braves' Johnny Hopp, the NL's leading hitter, maces three hits, one driving
in Boston's lone run.

Seerey again makes the record book becoming the first major leaguer to
strike out seven times in a doubleheader.

are injured, 7 critically, in a bus-truck crash near St. Paul. All told,
five are dead including manager George Treadwell, three players, and the
driver of the truck. The injured include Mel McGaha, future ML manager,
and Elmer Schoendienst, brother of the Cardinal infielder, Red.

1949
In the opener of a twin bill at Griffith Stadium, Indians hurler Bob
Lemon helps his cause by hitting two homeruns in a 7-5 victory over the
Senators. Cleveland completes the sweep when Gene Beardon gets the victory
in the Tribe's 5-2 win in the nightcap.

The Cards, with Musial hitting for the cycle, trounce the Dodgers, 14-1. This
win gives St. Louis 3 straight victories at Ebbets Field, as they take over
the lead Brooklyn has held through most of the season.

It is Frankie Frisch Day at the Polo Grounds and the former Giants star,
now the manager of the Cubs, is feted with two tv sets and numerous other
gifts from New York friends. His Cubs then add their presents, beating
the Giants twice, 5-3 and 6-1. The Cubs have 5 DPs in the opener and 2 in
the nitecap. Andy Pafko has a homer in the opener. In game 2, Hal Jeffcoat
drives in 2 runs in the 2nd with a double and later steals home. Bob Rush
and Doyle Lade are winners.

1950
At the annual Hall of Fame game in Cooperstown, the Red Sox beat the Giants,
8-5. Dick Littlefield goes all the way for Boston.

1951
At cavernous Forbes Field, Giants outfielder Willie Mays, unable to
reach across his body to make a catch with his glove of Rocky Nelson's
sinking 457-foot blast to deep center, sticks out his bare right hand and
grabs the ball on a full gallop to make the incredible final out of the
inning. Venerable Branch Rickey, Pittsburgh's general manager, sends a note
to the New York dugout during the game to tell the 20-year-old rookie, "That
was the finest catch I have ever seen, and the finest I ever expect to see".

1953
The Red Sox sweep the Browns as the two Boston pitchers, Mickey McDermott
and Bill Henry, hurl 6-0 and 8-0 shutouts.

Granny Hamner smashes 2 homers to give the Phils a 2-1 win over the
Cardinals. St. Louis scores in the 6th when Musial steals home for the first
time in his career. Cards manager Stanky fans as the lead-off batter in the
game, and when Hemus then singles, the Cards protest that the 2 batted out
of order (the lineup card has them reversed). The umps void the hit and
Musial, hitting 3rd, is called out.

1954
After Casey Stengel pulls Phil Rizzuto in the 8th for a pinch hitter,
he brings in Mickey Mantle again at SS. Mantle plays short with Willie
Miranda at 2B against lefthanded hitters. Against righties, Miranda and
Mantle switch positions. But Cleveland wins, 5-4, on Larry Doby's 2-run
homer in the 10th, his 3rd homer in 2 days at Yankee Stadium. Sam Dente
fills in at SS for George Strickland, sidelined with a broken jaw. The
Tribe go 2 1/2 games up on New York.

1955
Pitching for Seattle, Elmer Singleton fires his 2nd PCL no-hitter, beating
San Diego, 2-0, in 7 innings. Singleton pitched a 12-inning no-hitter in 1952,
only to give up 3 hits in the 13th and lose. He joins Skeeter Fanning as the
only PCL hurler with 2 no-hitters. In 2 days, former Dodger Chris Van Cuyk
will pitch another PCL no-hitter, beating LA, 2-0, in 7 innings for Oakland.

1956
Under cloudy skies, former first baseman/outfielder Hank Greenberg and
infielder Joe Cronin, currently serving as general managers for the Tigers
and Red Sox respectively, are inducted into the Hall of Fame as more than
8,500 fans witness the impressive ceremony. The former Detroit slugger
becomes the first Jewish player to be enshrined in Cooperstown.

New York City Mayor Robert Wagner appoints Charles J. Mylod as chairman, and
R. E. Blum and C. A. Allen as members of the newly created Brooklyn Sports
Center Authority. He reveals plans for a 50,000-seat stadium bounded by
Warren Street and Fourth, Flatbush and Fifth Avenues. Robert Moses prefers
a different Brooklyn site.

1958
It's McDougald and Mantle today hitting back-to-back shots, in the 9th, as
New York out-hits Detroit, 10-7. Paul Foytack is the reliever today. Mantle
is 3 for 4 as the Yanks sweep the Tigers.

Ted Williams is fined $250 for spitting at the Boston fans again.

At Wrigley, Ed Bailey hits a 2-run homer in the 8th to give the Reds the
4-3 win over the Cubs.

For the 2nd time in a week, a Dodger pitcher makes successive starts in a
game. Stan Williams, who pitched 2 innings yesterday, loses his 2nd in a
row at Pittsburgh, 5-3. Dick Stuart's 2-run HR in the 4th kayoes Williams.

1959
As a prelude to the IL game between the Havana Sugar Kings and visiting
Rochester Red Wings, Fidel Castro pitches two innings for his pickup team
Los Barbudos against a Military Police squad. Castro pitches both innings,
strikes out two batters with the aid of some friendly calls, and ground outs
to short. This well-photographed event is El Jefe's only mound appearance,
according to Cuban expert Pete Bjarkman.

1960
Chicago's 3rd straight win at Yankee Stadium and 8th straight overall,
6-3 behind Billy Pierce, gives the Sox a 2-game lead atop the AL. Eli Grba
beats Herb Score, 8-2, in the 2nd game to give New York a twin-bill split.

1961
In a mid-season exhibition match at Yankee Stadium, the San Francisco Giants
beat their former cross-town rivals, 4-1. Mickey Mantle's homer accounts
for the only Bronx Bombers run and Willie Mays has two RBIs for the visiting
'Jints'.

At Kansas City, Detroit P Frank Lary collides with rookie 3B Steve Boros,
and both players leave the game with injuries. Lary does not miss a start but
Boros' collarbone is broken and he will not return. He has 53 RBIs to date.

At Yankee Stadium, 50,000 fans, on hand for the Yankees exhibition game
with the Giants, save their biggest cheer for Willie Mays. Willie delivers
a 2-run single in the 4-1 victory. The only score for the Yanks is a Mickey
Mantle homer.

1962
In the 12th inning of a 4-4 tie with the Braves, Mets reliever Robert
G. Miller, not to be confused with Robert L. Miller, also on the team, gives
up a walk-off homerun to Del Crandall on the very first pitch he throws
this year. At the start of the season, the southpaw had been managing a car
agency, but was convinced by the struggling team to come out of retirement
because he only needed 18 more days of major league service to qualify for
the players' pension plan.

1963
The Royals sweep a pair at Fenway, winning 5-2 and 7-6. The A's Ken Harrelson
homers over the Red Sox bullpen in right CF, a rare feat for a RH hitter.

1964
Hank Aguirre gives up 5 runs on three homers to New York in the first 4
innings, but the Tigers overcome a 5-2 deficit to win 10-5.

1965
At the Astrodome, Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall loses his no-hitter when Bob
Lillis singles in the 8th inning. Nuxhall finishes with a 2-0 one-hitter.

1966
The Yankees beat the Angels, 9-1, in game one, and Mantle hits his 2nd
homer in two days. The roundtripper, his 493rd, ties him with Gehrig for
6th place on the all-time list.

1967
Chicago's 3-1 win at St. Louis puts the Cards and Cubs even atop the NL.

1968
In a 2-1 loss to the A's, White Sox hurler Hoyt Wilhelm breaks Cy Young's
record as he makes his 907th career appearance. The knuckleballer will
retire in 1972 after pitching in 1,070 games.

Don Drysdale walks 2 batters in the 5th, hits Brand with a pitch and then
plunks opposing pitcher Don Wilson with an offspeed pitch to force in a
run. Houston wins, 1-0.

1969
At Wrigley, Ken Holtzman tops Don Sutton for the 4th straight time - three
this year - as Chicago beats the Dodgers, 5-3. For a frustrated Sutton,
it is a Cubs-record 13th straight loss to Chicago stretching back to his
rookie year.

1970
Chicago's Bill Melton ties the ML record by striking out 7 times in a
doubleheader split with Detroit. Melton will strike out his first 3 times
up in his next game, in Baltimore on the 28th, before flying out in the
9th. The Sox win the opener today, 5-2, with 6 straight singles and 5 runs
in the 9th. The Tigers win the nitecap, 5-4, in the 9th when Don Wert draws
a walk from Wilbur Wood with the sacks full.

The Cubs pound the Braves for 16 hits and 11 runs and Ken Holtzman allows
6 hits as the Cubs roll, 11-1. Williams and Santo drive in 4 runs apiece
and Beckert scores 4 times.

In a surprise move, the Mets' Tommie Agee steals home with the bases loaded
in the 10th to give the Mets a 2-1 win over the visiting Dodgers. Agee
bunted and reached base on an error, stole 2B with 2 outs and went to 3B
on the throw. After two walks he took home to pin the loss on Brewer.

At Pittsburgh, Clemente celebrates Roberto Clemente night with a pair of
hits but leaves after suffering a cut left knee making a sliding catch on
the gravel warning track. Dock Ellis goes all the way allowing 4 hits as
the Pirates trounce the Astros, 11-0.

1972
Ted Simmons, who has been playing all season without a signed contract,
signs a new contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. The team claims the
signing, reportedly for two years at $35,000 per year, when the Federal
Pay Board exempted athletes from wage controls. Whether the owners fear a
possible test case or not, six players will open the 1973 season without
signing a contract and will play on renewed contracts:  Stan Bahnsen, Rick
Reichardt and Mike Andrews of the Chicago White Sox; Dick Billings of the
Texas Rangers; Fritz Peterson of the New York Yankees; and Jerry Kenney of
the Cleveland Indians.

1973
Although not selected, Willie Mays appears in his last All-Star game thanks
to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn increasing the player limit so the 'Say Hey Kid'
could participate in the Midsummer Classic. Bobby Bonds, a Giants teammate
of Mays, homers and doubles in the National League's 7-1 victory over the
AL at Royals Stadium in Kansas City.

The NL wins the All-Star Game at Kansas City, 7-1. A record 54 players
are used, including Willie Mays, who strikes out in his final All-Star
appearance, and Catfish Hunter, who sustains a fractured thumb that will
sideline him for 4 weeks. The A's ace has a 15-3 record at the time.

1974
Whitey Lockman becomes the team's director of player development, and will
be replaced as the Cubs manager by third base coach Jim Marshall. The Cubs
will still finish last. During Lockman's three-year stint in the dugout,
the Lowell, North Carolina native compiled a 157-162 (.492) record.

1975
The Royals fire manager Jack McKeon, hiring Whitey Herzog to replace him.

1976
At Comiskey, the Twins roll over the White Sox, 17-2. Lymon Bostock is 4
for 4, hitting for the cycle.

1977
Seattle's John Montague pitches 6 2/3 innings of perfect relief against
California, giving him 33 consecutive batsmen retired over 2 games to tie
the AL record. But California wins, 3-1.

1978
Pete Rose singles twice, the first time off Pat Zachry, during the Reds'
5-3 win over the Mets, extending his hitting streak to 37 games to tie the
modern NL record held by Tommy Holmes. When lifted, Zachry kicks the dugout
steps in anger, breaking his toe and ending his season.

Out on a force play. In Kansas City, a sobbing Billy Martin preempts a
firing by reading a prepared statement in which he resigns as the Yankee
manager. Martin's resignation comes shortly after he was quoted about
Reggie Jackson and George Steinbrenner saying, "The two of them deserve
each other. One's a born liar, and the other's convicted." Dick Howser will
fill in tonight as the Yanks lose, 5-2. Bob Lemon, a good friend of Yankee
president Al Rosen, is named as manager. The Bronx Bombers will win a World
Championship with their new skipper this season. At the time of Martin's
resignation, the defending champion Yankees are 52-42 and 10 games behind
the first-place Boston Red Sox in the American League East.

1979
Going deep off A's hurler Mike Morgan in the 7th inning at Fenway Park,
Red Sox first baseman Carl Yastrzemski becomes the 18th major leaguer and
seventh in the American League to hit 400 homeruns. 'Captain Carl' will
end his 23-year career with 452 homers.

In Pittsburgh, a 4th-inning call results in a 34-minute rhubarb during the
Pirates-Reds game. With Buc runners on 1st and 3rd, a 3-1 pitch to Omar Moreno
is called a ball, but Johnny Bench throws to 2B ahead of the runner from 1B,
Lee Lacy, who is attempting to steal. Lacy is called out by Dick Stello even
though Moreno has just received a walk (therefore entitling Lacy to 2B), and
walks off the bag. He is then tagged out by Dave Concepcion, precipitating
the argument. The subsequent protest is rejected by NL president Feeney,
and the Pirates' 6-5 loss is upheld.

In the first game of a doubleheader, Seattle C Bob Stinson ties a ML record
by allowing 2 Baltimore batters to reach base on catcher's interference. The
Birds win, 7-6, then complete the sweep, 11-3.

1980
Hours after signing a new 5-year contract that will boost his salary to
$1 million per year, Kansas City's George Brett goes 2 for 4 in a 12-4 win
over Chicago to raise his batting average to .379. The Royals lead 2nd-place
Texas by 11 games in the AL West.

1983
In the memorable "Pine Tar Game" at Yankee Stadium, George Brett hits an
apparent 2-run homerun off Rich Gossage to give the Royals a 5-4 lead with
2 outs in the 9th inning, only to have it taken away when Yankees manager
Billy Martin, at the urging of coach Don Zimmer, points out that the pine
tar on Brett's bat (a Marv Throneberry model) handle exceeds the 17 inches
allowed in the rules. As a result, Brett is called out for illegally batting
the ball, giving New York a 4-3 victory. Brett goes ballistic as the Royals
immediately protest, and AL President Lee MacPhail overrules his umpires for
the first time saying that, while the rules should certainly be rewritten
and clarified, the homerun will stand and the game will be resumed from
that point on August 18th. On August 18th the game resumes with the Royals
beating the Yankees, 4-3.

1990
Who needs a pickoff motion? Atlanta pitcher Charlie Leibrandt picks off
Craig Biggio by beating him back to 1B. Hough wins the game, 9-3. Atlanta
takes the nitecap from Houston scoring in the 8th and 9th to win, 9-8.
