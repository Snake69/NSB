1902
At Chicago, Elmer Flick and Nap Lajoie have three hits apiece as Cleveland
beats the White Sox, 6-2. Flick has 3 triples in 4 at-bats to set the AL
record for triples.

1903
In a game with the New York Highlanders, White Sox OF Danny Green is called
out at 1B by John Sheridan, and after returning to the bench continues to
yell at the ump. Sheridan finally rushes the bench and hits Green with his
mask, who then belts the umpire. The umpire is taken from the grounds and
locked up on charges of disorderly conduct. An hour later he is released
after bail is posted by Highlander president Joseph Gordon.

1904
Jack Chesbro's winning streak of 14 games comes to an end as Boston beats
the Highlanders, 4-1. Chesbro will win 41 games this year, to set a ML
record. Newly acquired Kip Selbach drives in 3 runs for New York.

1906
The Cubs take the 5th game in the series at Pittsburgh, 5-0, scoring
all their runs in the 9th. Three Finger Brown is the winner, allowing 4
hits. They will lose the last game of the series, on Monday in Chicago, 3-1.

1909
In a 15-3 blow-out of the Browns, the White Sox collect 12 stolen bases. The
thievery at Chicago's South Side Park includes the theft of home plate
three times.

In the Giants' 3-1 win over the Phils, New York collects 6 straight walks
in 6th. This is a ML record since tied in the NL, but will be broken in
the AL next month.

Inventor George Cahill brings his portable lights to Grand Rapids, Michigan
for a night game with the Zanesville Infants (Central L). The host team wins
11-10 in 7 innings, with the only complaints coming from the outfielders,
who had trouble seeing balls hit above the lights.

1911
At St. Louis, Smoky Joe Wood allows a single to Burt Shotton in pitching
a one-hitter. The Boston Red Sox win, 6-1.

1912
To fend off possible future challenges to the legality of the standard
contract and its reserve clause, new wording provides for compensation to
the player for the right to renew. A player's salary is specified as 75
percent for his services and 25 percent for the privilege of reserving them
for the following season.

1914
Suffering heavy losses from Federal League competition in Baltimore,
the Orioles' (IL) owner Jack Dunn offers Babe Ruth (plus Ernie Shore
and C Ben Egan) for $10,000 to old friend Connie Mack, who refuses,
pleading poverty. Cincinnati, which has a working agreement giving them
the choice of 2 players, ignores Ruth and takes OF George Twombley and SS
Claud Derrick. Dunn finally peddles his threesome to new owner Joe Lannin
of the Red Sox for a reported $25,000.

In an exhibition game in Buffalo, the Bisons (IL) humiliate the Boston
Braves, 10-2.

1915
The Phillies split with the Giants, losing the opener to Mathewson, 5-4,
and winning the nitecap, 1-0, behind former Giant Al Demaree.

After Brooklyn wins the opener, 4-3, over Boston, the two teams battle to

The A's continue to dismantle, shipping frontline pitcher Bob Shawkey to
the Yankees for $18,000.

1916
At St. Louis, Pete Alexander shuts out the Cards for a 1-0 Phillie win,
topping Lee Meadows. Dode Paskert in CF makes two leaping catches off the
bat of Bob Bescher to save homeruns.

In Chicago, the Cubs' Gene Packard twirls a one-hitter to beat the Braves,
1-0. Fred Snodgrass has the lone hit.

Who?! At Fenway, the Indians score in the first off Babe Ruth, but manage just
one more hit through the 7th. With the bases loaded in the bottom of the 7th,
lefty-hitting reserve Olaf Henrickson pinch hits for Ruth and draws a walk,
forcing home the tying run. Boston scores another in the 8th to win, 2-1.

1918
The Browns beat the host Washington Senators, 3-0, as the Nats manage just
3 hits off Allen Sothoron. Browns SS Jimmy Austin triples in the 9th off
Walter Johnson, then steals home.

In Chicago, the Cubs hand the Giants their 4th straight loss, beating New
York, 6-1. Starter Pol Perritt goes five innings to take the loss. Phil
Douglas wins to give Chicago a six-game lead in the NL. Perritt will come
back tomorrow and pitch a complete game victory to give the Giants a split
of their doubleheader with Chicago.

Rabbit Maranville gets a 10-day leave from the Navy and hits .316 in 11
games for the Braves before going back to sea.

At Newport, Rhode Island the Indians lose an exhibition game to a Navy
team, 5-2. The Navy offense is paced by OF Wally Rehg's 2-run homer, one
of three Navy outfielders from the Boston Braves. Joe Kelly and Ray Powell
team with Rehg.

In Omaha, the Western League votes to end this season after today's
games. In Ft Worth, Texas League president J. Walter Morris announces the
Texas League season will end today. The Pacific Coast and International
Leagues also close today.

1919
The Giants, leading 10-2 going into the 9th in the first game of a
doubleheader, ignore the Phils' base runners. Four get to 1B - Fred Luderus,
Eddie Sicking, Hick Cady and Gavvy Cravath - and each steals 2B and 3B,
tying the record for steals in one inning set by Washington on July 19,
1915. The Phils still lose, 10-5. In 1920 the rules will be changed so
that a base runner will not get credit for a stolen base due to defensive
indifference. New York wins the afternoon game, 7-2, in 10 innings.

In game 2 in Boston, the A's make 11 hits but Carl Mays pitches the last 2
innings to save it for the Sox, 5-4. Boston wins game 1 with a 2-0 shutout
by Sam Jones.

1920
Benny Kauff, after appearing in 55 games this season, is traded by the
Giants with cash to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for
Vern Spencer. In December, the New York outfielder had been implicated in
a car theft ring, and although aquitted of the charges, he will still be
banished from baseball for life by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

Following the Yankee series in Washington, Babe Ruth, wife Helen, OF Frank
Gleich, C Fred Hofmann and coach Charley O'Leary drive north stopping a
few times for drinks. About 3 A.M. near Wawa, Pennsylvania, Ruth takes a
curve too fast and rolls the car into a ditch. Incredibly, no one is hurt
though headlines tomorrow will proclaim:  RUTH REPORTED KILLED IN CAR CRASH.

The A's win two shutouts from the Red Sox, as Dave Keefe takes the first
game 6-0 and Scott Perry wins a 1-0 squeaker in the nitecap. For Keefe,
the inventor of the forkball, it is his only career shutout.

At Pittsburgh, the Pirates pull off the first triple play in more than 2
years, and edge the Phils, 2-1. Winning pitcher Wilbur Cooper starts the
TP by catching Zach Wheat's fly.

1921
The Cards top the Phillies, 15-2, as George Smith goes all the way for the
Quakers allowing 23 hits. The Cards help out by running the bases sloppily.

1922
Pirates OF Max Carey is the busiest man on the field in an 18-inning 9-8
loss to the Giants. He gets 6 hits, draws 3 walks, has 3 SBs, including
one of home, and catches 7 flies. His 51 stolen bases in 53 attempts is
the highest success rate ever achieved by a SB leader, remarkable in a
season where the league average success rate on steals is 54%. His record
of 31 straight steals without being caught will be broken by Davey Lopes'
38 in 1975. Johnny Gooch also has 6 hits in the losing effort.

Commissioner Landis bars ML teams from playing in Montreal.

1923
Cleveland scores in every inning against the Red Sox, but playing at home
they don't bat in the 9th. It's hardly needed as they roll to a 27-3 win
in a game known as "the Indian massacre." In their 8 innings, they run
up a then AL-record 27 runs, including 13 in the 6th, and tie the record
when 9 players score 2 or more runs. Boston's Bill Piercy leaves the game
with 2 outs in the 6th after being hit by a line drive off the bat of Tris
Speaker. Reliever Lefty O'Doul comes on and faces 16 batters, walking 6 and
allowing 13 unearned runs before recording the final out. Bosox manager
Frank Chance, annoyed at O'Doul's off-field antics, leaves Lefty on the
mound, O'Doul gives up the record-setting 13 unearned runs on 11 hits and
8 walks. The inning ends when 2B Riggs Stephenson is thrown out trying to
steal 2B, after the previous batter Joe Sewell had swiped 2B. O'Doul is
relieved in the 7th in this, his last season as a ML pitcher, but he will
return to the majors in 1928 as an OF. (O'Doul will become an outstanding
major league hitter and finish his 11-year stint in the majors with a
lifetime batting average of .349.) The Indians keep it up, scoring 3 in
the first inning of the 2nd game enroute to an 8-5 win.

There is scoring in the National League as well as the Pirates massacre the
Phillies, 18-5. Pie Traynor hits for the cycle and Reb Russell scores 5 runs.

1925
Rabbit Maranville leads the Cubs to a 10-5 win over Brooklyn at Ebbets Field,
with veteran Wilbur Cooper the winner over Tiny Osborne. Celebrating his
first victory that evening, Maranville gets into a fight with a cab driver.

1927
In the battle for 1st place, the Cubs oust the Pirates from the top spot
by winning, 2-1, in 8 innings. Hal Carlson wins over Joe Dawson. The Cubs
score twice in the 9th and the Pirates once after Pie Traynor triples home
Heinie Groh, when the game is called on account of rain.

Brooklyn manages just 4 hits against the Giants, but it is enough to win,
3-2. Dazzy Vance scatters 7 hits for the victory. Jay Partridge's 2-run
homer in the 3rd is the deciding blow for the Robins.

The Senators trade righthander General Crowder to the Browns to bring back
southpaw Tom Zachary. In a disastrous trade, Griffith had swapped Zachary
to the Browns in February of 1926, after the lefty was just 12-15 for the
Senators in 1925. Washington got Joe Bush and Jack Tobin, both of whom were
gone by July, while Zachary won 14 for the Browns in 1926.

1928
Bob Sanguinett of Midland (West Texas League) hits a homer in his 10th
straight game, a minor league record that will not be matched in the
century. The streak started on June 25. Mike Calise of Louisville (AA) will
come the closest, hitting homers in 8 straight games in 1982. Sanguinett
breaks the record of 7 straight games, held jointly by Richmond (Blue Grass
League) teammates Norman Nunn and Louis Munn, who did it in 1912.

1929
Pittsburgh jumps out to an 8-0 lead over Brooklyn and then rolls to a 17-6
win. Two Buc pitchers, Erv Brame and Fred Fussell, hit homers, a first in
the 20th century.

In St. Louis, Heinie Manush hits 3 balls off the newly erected screen
against the Yankees' Waite Hoyt, good for a single and 2 doubles, while
Ruth hit 2 off it in the series, including one today. The Browns win, 7-2.

At Mack Park in Detroit, 103 fans are injured, four badly, when gasoline,
spread over the wet infield and lit to dry it off, bursts into flame (as noted
by Rod Nelson). The ensuing grandstand fire destroys the semi-pro ball park.

1930
On Babe Herman's homer and 2 doubles, the Robins nose out the Reds, 2-1,
and take over first place from the Cubs. Ray Moss wins the pitching duel
over Bob Smith.

The host Phillies pound out 22 hits and still lose to the Giants, 13-12. New
York totals 16 hits off three pitchers. Lefty O'Doul and Chuck Klein hit
homers for the Quakers, but in the 9th inning with two on and two out,
Carl Hubbell comes in to strike out Klein.

At Boston, Alvin Crowder pitches the Senators into first place, beating
the Red Sox, 8-1. It is Crowder's 5th win since joining the Senators and
the 8th in a row for the Senators. In a pre-season AP poll, the Senators
were picked to finish in 7th place, just ahead of the Red Sox. Their stay
at the top will be short-lived, however.

1931
The Browns and the White Sox play a record 12-inning game in which not a
single strikeout is recorded. Chicago wins 10-8. The Browns tie the game
at 8-8 when pinch hitter Chad Kimsey homers in the 9th. Kimsey then pitches
2 scoreless innings before Al Simmons drives in 2 runs in the 12th.

1933
In Allentown, Phillies 2B Mickey Finn, 30, dies following a recent abdominal
operation.

In Chicago, a jury acquits Indians 1B Harley Boss of attacking a young
women in his hotel room following dinner. He says she asked for money and
he asked her to leave.

The Red Sox release fan favorite Fats Fothergill.

1935
At St. Louis, the Dean brothers deal the 2nd-place Cards a double win over
the Reds, 9-4 and 5-1. In the 4th inning of the opener Diz is booed when
he relieves Jess Haines in the 4th inning. Dizzy, who refused to take a bow
in an exhibition game at St. Paul, turns the boos into cheers when he hits
a single in the 5-run 5th inning, and holds the Reds scoreless the rest of
the way to win his 13th. Paul scatters 7 hits in the nitecap.

After four attempts, Carl Hubbell wins his 10th, defeating the Dodgers,
9-2. The Dodgers take a 2-1 lead but Mel Ott's grand slam in the 3rd sends
the first-place Giants to a 6 1/2 game lead at the All-Star break. Ott has
18 homers, tops in the NL ... Greenberg is leading the AL with 23.

The Yankees crush the Senators, 11-1, as Lazzeri and Gehrig drive home all
the runs. Both hit homers, Gehrig hitting a grand slam and Tony's a 3-run
shot, off Buck Newsom. Lazzeri adds another three RBIs on singles. Johnny
Broaca pitches the complete game win for the first-place Yankees (45-26).

The Tigers crush the Browns, 12-5, for their 10th straight win. St. Louis
pitchers hand out 11 walks as Detroit scores 11 in the first three
innings. Moose Solters accounts for all the Brownie runs with homers his
first three times up. Hank Greenberg has a double and a triple and three
RBIs to give him an even 100 at the All-Star break.

Phillies 2B Lou Chiozza ties a NL record with 11 assists in a 9-1 win over
Boston. Chiozza has a pair of hits to back Curt Davis' pitching.

At a special meeting, the AL owners raise the waiver price from $4,000 to
$7,500, the same as the National League. There was no discussion of the
reputed plan to shift the St. Louis Browns franchise elsewhere, but the
club owners informally endorse a plan to give the all star voting "back to
the fans."

1936
The NL, having lost the first 3 All-Star Games, wins 4-3 at Boston's
National League Park with four different Cub players (Galan, Herman,
Hartnett and Demaree) scoring runs. After Dizzy Dean and Carl Hubbell
each pitch scoreless 3-inning stints, Curt Davis is hammered by the AL,
including Lou Gehrig's HR, but Lon Warneke shuts the door. Meanwhile, the
NL is helped by Joe DiMaggio's loose fielding and error, and Augie Galan's
HR. DiMag is the first rookie to play in an All-Star game. The NL plays its
starting lineup throughout except for 2 late-inning pinch hitters. Local
favorite and 3-time starter Wally Berger doesn't appear. Missing from
the NL roster are Dolph Camilli and Buck Jordan, BA co-leaders at .348,
as well as the eventual batting champ Paul Waner.

1937
Lou Gehrig leads the AL All-Stars over the NL, 8-3, with a HR, double and 4
RBIs in a game that President Franklin Roosevelt attends in Washington. Joe
Medwick has 4 hits for the Nationals. In the 3rd inning, Dizzy Dean's right
toe is fractured by a drive off the bat of Earl Averill. After the injury
Dean is unable to pitch with the same delivery. He uses an unnatural motion,
causing an arm injury from which he never recovers. Left off the powerful
AL squad is Hank Greenberg, whose 103 RBIs at the All-Star break will not
be topped.

1939
Sacramento (PCL) beats San Francisco 5-4 in an exhibition game played inside
Folsom Prison.

1940
The Bees sting the Dodgers twice by one run, dropping Brooklyn out of first
place. Manuel Salvo wins the opener, 1-0, when Johnny Cooney drives home
the lone run off Whit Wyatt. Coffman checks the Dodgers in the nitecap,
2-1. The Reds, 4-3 winners at Chicago, take over the NL lead, which they
will not relinquish.

At the NL club owners meeting in St. Louis, Ford Frick proposes batting
helmets for hitters. Frick admitted his idea had met with a lukewarm response
when players and managers were polled. Frankie Frisch talked it over with
the Pirates and most were against it.

1942
A military all-star team, captained by Mickey Cochrane, that includes Bob
Feller, Cecil Travis, Sam Chapman, Benny McCoy, Johnny Sturm and Frank
Pytlak loses 5-0 to the AL stars in a night game at Cleveland in front of
62,094 fans. Jim Bagby wins against his Indian teammate Feller. The winner
is Military relief which receives $160,000.

1943
Chicago's Wally Moses swipes home in the 14th inning to give the White Sox
a 3-2 win over the Red Sox. It is the second steal of home in extra innings
for Moses this year, and a record three times he's accomplished the feat.

1945
White Sox outfielder Wally Moses leads off the 1st inning with a walk,
moves to 3B, and swipes home when A's pitcher Luther Knerr goes into a slow
windup. That's all the scoring Chicago pitcher Bill Dietrich needs for the
1-0 win.

1948
The Indians stun the baseball world by signing Satchel Paige, fabulous
veteran Negro League pitcher. The move is ridiculed by some as a Bill
Veeck publicity stunt, and A.G. Spink in The Sporting News editorializes,
"Veeck has gone too far in his quest for publicity ... To sign a hurler at
Paige's age is to demean the standards of baseball in the big circuits." The
42-year-old Paige will answer the critics tomorrow, getting a relief decision
in an 8-6 win over New York in a DH sweep. He will finish at 6-1. Paige
is the oldest player to debut in the majors, but not the first 40-year-old
... Chuck Hostetler in 1944 was 40.

1949
Pitcher Dave Koslo hits the first 2 homers of his career - he'll hit one more
- and drives in 5 runs while beating the Phils 11-3 at the Polo Grounds. Mize

over Chicago.

1951

Indians as the motormen roll, 13-3. Bob Cain is the victor with batterymate
Myron Ginsberg driving in 5 runs on 4 hits.

At Fenway, the Yankees lose to the Red Sox, 10-4 with the Sox being led
by Clyde Vollmer's grand slam in the first inning. Vollmer, inserted as
a starter on July 4, had a 2-run triple in yesterday's 6-2 win over the
Yankees. Mantle, a late inning defensive replacement, hits a 9th inning HR
off Ellis Kinder, the complete-game winner.

1953
The Dodgers set a major league mark for most homeruns in consecutive games
by a team with 24 games with at least one round tripper.

The Browns set the ML mark for consecutive home defeats, as they drop their
20th in succession, 6-3 to the Indians. The streak dates back to June 3rd.

In Philadelphia, the bus carrying the Yankees to the train station is involved
in an accident, and Allie Reynolds injures his back. He will suffer chronic
pain as a result.

The Dodgers establish a new NL record by hitting a HR in their 21st
consecutive game, sweeping a pair from the Pirates, 5-4 and 9-5. Hodges,
Snider and Robinson go deep in the opener, while game 2 features a pair of
HRs by Billy Cox and a dinger from Preacher Roe. It is Roe's only homer in
his career. Preston Ward has a game 1 homer - a grand slam - while Frank
Thomas hits a 3-run HR in game 2, both coming in the 9th.

1954
At New York, the Yankees outslug the Red Sox, 17-9. Mantle has three hits,
including his 12th homer, off Tom Brewer.

1956
At Chicago, the Tigers blast 3 successive homers off Dick Donovan in the

1958
At the NL meeting, William Shea outlines plans for a $12 million stadium at
Flushing Meadows, the eventual site of Shea Stadium. NL President Warren
Giles appoints a committee to study the possible expansion of the league
to 10 teams.

1959
At Forbes Field, Hank Aaron's eighth-inning single ties the score and a
triple hit by Willie Mays plates Aaron with the winning run in the 5-4

during the season. Don Drysdale pitches perfect ball the first 3 innings.

1961

his sore right arm.

1962
The Athletics again spot the Senators a 4-run lead and score 5 runs in the
8th inning, off reliever Dave Stenhouse, and edge the Senators, 9-8. Bobby
Del Grevo's 2-run homer is the big blow in the frame. Not until the the
Yankees, on July 30 and 31st, 2005 against the Twins will an AL team come
back in consecutive games trailing by 4 runs.

1963
3B Jim Ray Hart debuts with the Giants singling and doubling during a
15-inning 4-3 squeaker over the Cards at Candlestick. In the 2nd game,
Hart suffers a broken collarbone when hit by a Bob Gibson pitch.

1964
In the only All-Star game ever played at Shea Stadium, the National League
evens the all-time series at 18 victories for each circuit by beating the
AL, 7-4, with a dramatic 4-run ninth-inning rally which includes a three-run
homer by Phillies slugger Johnny Callison off Dick Radatz. Home team second
baseman Ron Hunt becomes the first Mets player to be selected as a starter
in the Midsummer Classic.

1966
At Yankee Stadium, New York scores 2 runs to tie Boston 2-2 in the bottom
of the 9th. Then with 2 on and 2 out, Mantle breaks a 1 for 17 slump with
a 3 run shot into the RF stands.

1967

the midst of a 7-game losing streak.

1968
Denny McLain, the major leagues' winningest pitcher with 16, helps Detroit
take a 9 1/2 game lead in the AL at the All-Star break, as the Tigers sweep
the A's 5-4 and 7-6. McLain wins the opener when Willie Horton clubs a
3-run homer, and Al Kaline matches that in the nitecap.

1970
Rico Carty, the National League's leading hitter, becomes the first player
voted to play in the All-Star Game as a write-in candidate. The Braves
outfielder's name was left off the ballot that was drawn up by managers
and general managers before the start of spring training.

Brooks Robinson cracks a 10th-inning grand slam off New York's Lindy McDaniel
to give the Orioles a 6-2 win.

Phil Regan picks up two wins in relief for the second time this season as the
Cubs sweep the Pirates, 5-4 and 4-3, edging Bob Veale and Elroy Face. Regan
won a pair on April 21st for the Dodgers, and no reliever has ever won a
pair twice in a season. The Vulture will top the NL with 12 relief wins
and 25 saves.

Completing a 7-game West Coast winning streak, the Cardinals take a 10-game
lead into the All-Star break.

Back in the Expos lineup for the first time since June 27, Ken Singleton
drives in 3 runs to support Bill Stoneman's 7-2 win over the Giants. Singleton
wears a special uniform to prevent a rash from recurring because of his
allergy to materials in the Expos regular uniform.

1973
The Brewers unload on 18-year-old P David Clyde to whip the Rangers 19-5 and
hand Eddie Rodriguez his first ML win, a complete-game effort. Milwaukee
has a 5-run 6th and 7-run 7th and is paced by Bobby Coluccio's grand slam
and Don Money's 3-run homer.

1974
In the opener of a doubleheader, Don Money sets a ML record for consecutive
errorless games at 3B with 78. The Brewers beat the Twins 8-5, then lose
5-3. Money will end the season with just 5 errors, breaking George Kell's
record set in 1950. Money also holds the NL record with just 10 errors,
set with the Phils in 1972.

In an 11-2 win over the Cards, Reds pitcher Darrell Chaney hits a grand
slam homerun. Chaney will hit 14 homers in the ML, but the radio call on
the slam will end up as his front door bell chime.

1975
In an 8-6 loss to the Cardinals at Busch Stadium, Giants catcher Marc Hill -
as well as the Cards - ties a mark last accomplished in 1905 when he tags
out three Cards runners at home on throws from the outfield. The three
Cards dealt out are:  Ken Reitz in the first inning on a throw from LF Gary
Thomasson, Reitz tries scoring from 2B on a Mike Tyson single; Ron Fairly
in the 6th inning thrown out by RF Bobby Murcer on a Tyson fly ball; Bake
McBride in the 7th thrown out by LF Chris Arnold when he tries to score on

home was in 1905 when Cubs flycatcher Jack McCarthy accomplished the feat
with his three outfield assists.

1978
The Brewers' Mike Caldwell beats the Yankees' Ron Guidry, 6-0. For Guidry
(13-1), it is his first loss of the season. Caldwell shut out the Yankees
9 days earlier, and will shut them out again on September 19th.

1979
Mike Schmidt homers in his first 3 times up for the Phillies, to give him a
ML-record-tying 4 straight over 2 games. Schmidt flies to the warning track

hit 3 more HRs in the next 3 games to tie the NL record of 7 HRs in 5 games.

1982

Floyd Youmans, ticketed for the minors after the game to make way for
Gullickson coming off the DL, pitches the last 3 innings to get his 1st ML

Enos Cabell and a 2-run single by Fitzgerald do it for the Expos.

1986

memorable when he leads off the inning with a game-ending homerun off
the 27-year-old rookie. The Cardinals' southpaw is the first hurler to
surrender a game-winning homerun to the first major league batter he faces
since San Diego's right-hander J.J. Trujillo accomplished the deed in his
major league debut by allowing Baltimore's Tony Batista to end a game with
a round-tripper in 2002.

Adam Dunn becomes the second Washington Nationals player to hit three
homeruns in a game, and the first major leaguer to accomplish the feat at

edge San Diego, 7-6, on a very warm night in the nation's capital.

2012
Bryce Harper becomes the youngest position player to make an All-Star team
when he is named to replace Miami's Giancarlo Stanton, who is unable to
participate because of an injury. The 19-year-old Nationals outfielder,
who is older than hurlers Dwight Gooden (Mets) and Bob Feller (Indians)
when they played in their first Mid-summer Classics, surpasses backstop
Butch Wynegaras (Twins) as the youngest non-pitcher to be selected.

In the bottom of the first inning at Minute Maid Park, first base umpire Sam
Holbrook tosses Zack Greinke from the game. The arbitrator takes exception

hurler covered the bag in a 6-4 loss to Houston.

2017
Aaron Judge set the Yankee franchise rookie record for homeruns by hitting
