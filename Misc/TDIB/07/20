his form in New York, going 11-6 this year and will win 27 games in 1906.

1905
SS Phil Lewis has a busy afternoon at Washington Park in the Brooklyn 2-1 win
over the Cincinnati Reds. Lewis has 18 chances and comes up with 7 assists,
6 put outs and 5 errors, the latter tying the NL record. Winning pitcher
Stricklett makes 2 errors. The attendance for the last place Brooklynites
is 1500; they had 330 for a recent game.

1906
Brooklyn righthander Mal Eason, the victim of John Lush's no-hitter in May,
no-hits the Cardinals, 2-0, at St. Louis. Eason walks 3 and strikes out
5. This will be Eason's last season as an active player ... he will become
an NL umpire.

Against Christy Mathewson, the Cubs overcome a 3-2 deficit with 4 runs in
the 8th inning to win, 6-3. Harry Steinfeldt's 2-run triple puts the Cubs
ahead to stay.

1907
Chicago's Carl Lundgren and New York's Mathewson are stingy today with the
Cubs' twirler allowing just 4 hits while the Cubs scratch 3 off Matty. The
Giants score in the 4th when Cy Seymour parks a drive in the bleachers with
two on. Prevailing rules make the hit a single, with just one run scoring
... it is enough as Matty wins, 1-0. Joe Tinker is hitless against Matty,
the only time this year that Mathewson shuts down his nemesis.

1909
New York suffers two losses against the Cards. The first is a line drive
in the 7th off the bat of Joe Delahanty that breaks a finger on the left
hand of Christy Mathewson. Matty leaves the game and the Cards win, 4-3,
in 11 innings. The Giants load the bases in the 11th with no outs but fail
to score. Matty's broken finger turns out to be "mashed."

1911
Frank Schulte hits for the cycle to help the Cubs tip the Phils,
4-3. "Wildfire" will end the year as the first player ever to top the 20
mark in doubles, triples, homers and stolen bases. Only Willie Mays in 1957
will match him.

The Cardinals knock Mathewson out of the box in the 2nd inning with 5 hits
and 5 runs. Doc Crandall relieves for New York, but the Cards win, 8-5.

1912
Ray Caldwell of the Highlanders, inserted as a pinch runner in the 9th,
steals home for the tying run in an eventual 4-3 win over Cleveland. Maloney,
another pinch runner in the 9th, steals 2B and scores the winner. Caldwell
then pitches a 4-0 victory in the second game.

In Chicago, the Phils pound the Cubs, 14-2. Sherry Magee leads the way with
two steals of home tying a ML record.

Jeff Tesreau, with relief help from Mathewson in the 9th, beats the Pirates,
2-1. Four singles in the 9th inning off Hank Robinson provide the Giants
with the margin.

1913
The Tigers ship 38-year-old George Mullin (1-6), five times a 20-game winner,
to Washington. Mullin pitched a no-hitter a year ago on his birthday.

1914
Lefty Tyler and Bill James combine to hold the Pirates to 4 hits and the
Braves score a run in the 9th to win, 1-0. Boston (37-43) now moves into
6th place past the Dodgers.

Hub Leonard, pitching masterfully in relief for the Red Sox, throws 8 hitless
innings against the Tigers while striking out 9 batters. The Sox win it,
3-2, to stay in 3rd place ahead of Washington.

1916
The Reds acquire three future Hall of Famers when Christy Mathewson is
traded to Cincinnati with Giants CF Edd Roush and 3B Bill McKechnie for
former Giants Buck Herzog and Red Killefer. McKechnie will make it to
Cooperstown as a manager, not as a player, but the 23-year-old Roush
is a steal for the Reds. A longtime nemesis of the Reds, Mathewson will
pitch one game and then manage, and a new team nickname will be coined:
"Matties." The Reds split today, managing just two hits off Pete Alexander,
who contributes 2 doubles himself to the Phils offense. Alexander wins 6-0,
but the Reds salvage a victory in game 2, winning 5-3.

The Tigers beat the 2nd place Red Sox, 3-2, in 13 innings when Ty Cobb scores
on a Ralph Young single. Cobb reached on an infield chop and a throwing error
by Babe Ruth, who took over for Rube Foster in the 9th with the score, 2-2.

In the PCL, William Rodgers of Portland makes an unassisted triple play
against Salt Lake. Billy Orr and Buddy Ryan are on base for the TP. On July 4,
1921, Henry Sands of Salt Lake will make an unassisted triple play against
Sacramento, and both Orr and Ryan, now with Sacramento, will be on base again.

1918
Cleveland president James Dunn wires AL headquarters "We will play a
double-header with Washington tomorrow and then close the ball park for the
balance of the season. It is our desire to comply with Secretary Baker's
ruling on baseball." Dunn's wire is in answer to Ban Johnson's telegram
asking if the owners wanted to comply at once.

The visiting Dodgers beat the Cubs for the third game in a row, topping
the Bruins, 6-4. Chicago scores first when Fred Merkle clips Rube Marquard
for a 3-run homer, but with the game knotted in the 9th, Hy Myers clouts
a two-run homer off a tired Claude Hendrix. Larry Cheney wins in relief.

In Washington, Walter Johnson goes the distance in beating the White Sox,
6-1. The Senators score four runs in the 4th off Frank Shellenback, who
takes the loss.

At Philadelphia, the A's take the opener with Cleveland, 10-4, then forfeit
the nitecap when the crowd surges onto the field. Cleveland is leading
9-1 in the 9th when fans surge onto the field and stood along the foul
lines. The AL indefinitely suspends Bill Wambsganss and Steve O'Neill for
their altercations on the 15th in New York.

The visiting Boston Braves beat the Reds, 8-3. Rookie Jesse Haines makes
his lone appearance for the Reds, allowing a run in 5 innings, but he'll
return to the Western League. Haines will resurface in the majors with the
Cardinals in 1920, eventually making the Hall of fame.

1920
With two outs in the 9th, the White Sox score four to defeat the Yankees,
7-5. The Yanks load the bases in their half of the 9th and fail to score. Babe
Ruth poles his 32nd homer in the losing cause. The Yanks come back to win
the 2nd game, 6-3, behind George Mogridge. Ruth is hitless but Wally Pipp
hits a homer. The series at the Polo Grounds sets a new attendance record
of 120,000 for the four days.

1922
At Sportsman's Park, Rogers Hornsby belts a 2-out 9th-inning HR with two men
on to the give the Cards a 7-6 win over Boston. It is the Rajah's 25th HR

weeks, Hornsby will break the record of 27 homers set in 1884 by Chicago's
Ned Williamson.

1924
In Washington, George Sisler hits a 1st-inning solo HR off Walter Johnson,
but the Senators come back to win, 5-4. Allan Russell is the winner in relief.

1926
A's outfielder Al Simmons establishes an American League record by playing

in 518 consecutive games after signing as a Japanese free agent with the
Yankees, will surpass the Hall of Famer's mark in 2005.

Springfield makes the news again as they join with Peoria (Three I league)
to set an OB scoring record. Springfield wins, 33-23. Peoria outhits
Springfield 27 to 22 and has 4 homers, 3 by Harry Layne.

1928

in the 7th.

Bud Tinning.

The Yankees manage just three hits in a 3-1 loss to Cleveland's Mel Harder,
scoring a single run when Ben Chapman drives in Ruth with a sac fly.

1936
In an exhibition game in Pittsburgh, former Yankee Waite Hoyt stops his old
teammates, 7-2. Lou Gehrig's 6th-inning homer is the first score for New
York. Ted Kleinhaus is cuffed in his 8 innings. While Hoyt wins, another
old pitcher loses as the Pirates hand Guy Bush his release. The Bees will
sign him.

1937
At Sportsman's Park, the Browns load the bases with no outs in the 10th
inning against the Yankees, but fail to score. Pinch hitting manager Hornsby
grounds into a force at home, then Ethan Allen's fly out results in a tag
out at home. DiMaggio contributes his 25th homer of the year, and adds
a double play from CF as the Yanks win it, 5-4. DiMaggio has two hits in

In St. Louis, the Browns stretch their lead with a 7-3 win over the
Yankees. The game is marked by a wild display among fans after ump Cal
Hubbard banishes Browns hurler Nelson Potter in the 5th inning for wetting the
ball. The game is held up for 15 minutes. The Browns start the spitcalling
in the 4th inning, accusing Yanks Hank Borowy of loading up a ball. Potter
is banished for 10 days for allegedly "putting an illegal substance on the
ball," but will return to win 19 games for St. Louis. Potter is the first
pitcher ever to be suspended for throwing a spitball The spitball, shineball
and emeryball were outlawed by the major league's Joint Rules Committee
in 1920 which allowed the seventeen pitchers using the doctored pitches at
the time to keep throwing the banned pitches legally until they retired.

1947
The choice rhubarb of the year occurs at Brooklyn in the top of the 9th with
the Cardinals leading, 2-0. Ron Northey hits a long fly ball that 3B umpire
Beans Reardon signals has gone into the stands - but 1B ump Larry Goetz
rules the ball in play. Northey jogs around the bases only to discover
Dodger catcher Bruce Edwards awaiting him with the ball. With Northey's
homer nullified, the Dodgers then score three runs in the bottom of the
inning to win, 3-2. The Cardinals protest and on the 26th NL Prexy Ford
Frick upholds the protest and the homer is good. But he allows the Dodger
scores to remain and the game is ruled a tie, even though the Cards are

doubleheader on August 18.

the 2nd in the majors in three weeks (Ferris Fain hit one on June 29), to
lead the Browns to 4-3 win. The Browns edge the Sox, 7-6, in the nitecap,
with Heath driving home 3 runs. Mele has 4 ribbies for Boston, now 45-40.

1948
An unprecedented 10-game suspension and $500 fine of an umpire, the
veteran Bill McGowan, is announced by AL President Will Harridge following a
confrontation in the Washington-Cleveland game. Tired of Senator pitcher Ray
Scarborough continually complaining about strike calls, McGowan had thrown
a ball-and-strike indicator at him. After that he ejects Nats manager Joe
Kuhel and several coaches. Kuhel also lodged a protest after yesterday's 11th
inning loss when Ed Stewart was thrown out at home in the 10th. When Stewart
argued the call with plate ump Paparella, McGowan threw a ball at Stewart.

The Giants beat St. Louis, 13-3, with an 8-run 3rd inning. Roy "Stormy"
Weatherly has a double and triple in the inning.

1951
In a game against the Reds with all-star hurler Ewell Blackwell on the
mound, the Giants, for the first time, employ their infamous scheme for
stealing catcher's signs using a telescope positioned in the centerfield
clubhouse. The 'Jints' beat Cincinnati, 11-6, and New York will win 22 of
the remaining 27 games at the Polo Grounds overtaking the Dodgers to win
National League pennant. In a move that will aid their pennant drive, the
Giants put OF Bobby Thomson at 3B to replace the slumping Hank Thompson,
out with a spike injury. Thomson, who's been riding the bench since losing
his starting job to the rookie Mays, will hit .357 for the rest of the season.

hits a 2-run HR in the 9th.

Brooklyn also wins 7-5, over the Cubs, as Duke Snider hits his 300th homer
and his 8th in 10 games since the All-Star break. Drysdale is the winner,

Dodgers stay a game in back of the Braves.

1958
Jim Bunning of the Tigers pitches a 3-0 no-hitter over the Red Sox and
fans 12. Only 2 walks and a hit batsman mar Bunning's performance as he
wins his 6th game in his last 7 decisions (8-6). The future Hall of Famer
and U.S. Senator will become the first modern pitcher to toss a hitless

inside-the-park grand slam since Deacon Phillippe did it for the Pirates

Hart single. It's the only tally as the Giants beat Houston, 1-0.

1969
San Francisco's Gaylord Perry connects for his first hit of the year, and
his first ML homer to beat the Dodgers, 7-3. The victim of Perry's dinger
is Claude Osteen. Last year, Alvin Dark had remarked to sports writer Harry
Jupiter about Perry's hitting, "They'll put a man on the moon before he
hits a homerun." Perry's homer comes about 20 minutes after the club house
receives word that Neil Armstrong has set foot on the moon.

Jim Perry does his brother one better by winning two games today in
Minnesota's sweep of the Pilots. Playing two more innings to complete
yesterday's suspended game, the Twins score 4 runs in the 18th to win, 11-7,
then follow with a 4-0 win. Perry tosses 11 innings of shutout ball to win
the pair. The loser in both games is John Gelnar. In the extra inning game,
the 2 teams strand a ML record 44 runners, with the Twins contributing 23
(the Mets and Cards will leave 45 runners on during a September 11, 1974
marathon). The 2 wins means the Twins go into the All-Star break with a 4
game lead over the A's in the AL West.

no-hitter to Atlanta with 2 outs in the 9th, no-hits the Phillies 5-0
(the first Dodger no-hitter since Sandy Koufax' departure), giving up no
walks. He strikes out 10 and makes 2 miscues, one a controversial throwing
error that pulls 1B Wes Parker off the base. The Phillies' players argue,
contending the soft chopper by Don Money should be a hit. Singer had
spent 3 weeks in the hospital in June, and 52 days on the disabled list,
for hepatitis. Singer posts a 5-0 record along with a 1.84 ERA in July,
and will be named NL Player of the Month.

With the score tied 1-1 in the 9th, Chicago's Ken Holtzman walks Hank Aaron
before Tommy Aaron homers for a 3-1 Braves victory.

Stadium, 8-3.

1978
After coming upon Expos GM Charlie Fox arguing with the slumping Chris
Speier, pitcher Steve Rogers, a player rep, intervenes and gets punched in
the mouth for his troubles. Fox will get fired at the end of the year but

cycle and drives in 6 runs to lead Montreal to a 7-3 win over Atlanta.

gives up a bloop single to Craig Reynolds and back-to-back home runs to
Denny Walling and Dickie Thon before settling down for a 10-3 victory.
