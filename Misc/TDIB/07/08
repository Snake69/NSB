Jul 8

1901
An 8th-inning decision favoring the Brooklyn Superbas infuriates St. Louis
fans. When the 7-5 Brooklyn win ends, they rush umpire Hank O'Day, who
suffers a split lip before St. Louis players and police can rescue him.

At Chicago, the Colts and Phils both score in the 9th and Chicago plates
a run in the 10th to win, 2-1. After the game, Chicago releases veteran
Cupid Childs, who went hitless today.

Player-manager George Davis leads the Giants to a 9-3 win over Cincinnati
with four hits, including 2 inside-the-park homers, and four RBIs. Mathewson
beats Dick Scott for the 2nd time this year, though Matty's control is
off. He walks 4 batters and hits two, including Cincy 1B Jake Beckley,
who is hit in the head with a Matty pitch and knocked out for 5 minutes.

1902
John McGraw, accused by Ban Johnson of trying to wreck the Baltimore and
Washington clubs, negotiates his release from the Orioles and officially
signs to manage the Giants at $11,000 a year, although he'd already secretly
signed a contract several days earlier brought to Baltimore by Giants
secretary Fred M. Knowles. McGraw says, "I wish to state that I shall not
tamper with any of the Baltimore club's players." But conspiring with NL
owners Brush and Andrew Freedman, McGraw swings the sale of the Orioles
their way, enabling them to release Orioles Dan McGann, Roger Bresnahan,
Joe McGinnity and Jack Cronin for signing by the Giants. Joe Kelley and Cy
Seymour go to Brush's Cincinnati Reds. Both the Orioles of the AL, and the
Giants of the NL will finish in last place, the only time a manager has
skippered both last-place teams in the same year.

In the first of two, the Giants edge Chicago, 1-0, with Christy Mathewson
outpitching Bob Rhodes. Chicago wins the nitecap, 2-0, in 7 innings.

A rough outing as Boston righthander Doc Adkins faces 16 batters and gives up
12 hits and 12 runs in the 6th inning of a Philadelphia A's 22-9 win over the
Somersets. Five players - Hartsel, Davis, Lave Cross, Seybold and Murphy -
collect two hits apiece in the frame. The A's new 2B Danny Murphy does not
arrive until the 2nd inning and takes over for Lou Castro in the field with
no batting practice. He is 6 for 6, including a three-run homer off Cy Young,
while handling 12 chances flawlessly in a sensational AL debut (he played
briefly in the NL last year). Teammate Harry Davis adds a grand slam. The
45 hits - 27 by the A's - by the two teams sets an AL record that will be
tied in 1928. Rube Waddell picks up the win, facing just three batters in
one inning of relief, while singling in the big inning.

1903
Chicago's Nick Altrock, pitching against the Boston Americans, loses to
his former team, 6-1.

1904
In the fight for first place in the AL, Boston continues to roll, beating
New York, 12-3, Kip Selbach has a single and a triple.

1905
In an AL doubleheader split at Philadelphia, Boston has a ML record 14
doubles and the A's 12. The 26 doubles is also a ML record. Boston's Hobe
Ferris has 5 doubles as Boston wins the opener, 11-8, and loses game 2, 11-4.

1907
Bombarded by pop bottles in Brooklyn, irate Cubs manager Frank Chance throws
one back into the stands where it cuts a boy's leg. Chance is mobbed and
leaves the park in an armored car with a police escort after the Cubs'
5-0 victory. Three Finger Brown emerges with the shutout win.

1908
Despite 5 hits by Honus Wagner, the host Pirates drop a doubleheader to
their cross-state rivals, the Phillies, 4-1 and 8-5. They will split the
next two games, but lose Deacon Phillippe for the year when he is hit on
his pitching hand by a Red Dooin line drive.

1910
Against the Browns, Walter Johnson K's the first 7 hitters and 8 of the
first 9 batters. After Washington scores 10 runs in the 5th inning, Johnson
records no more strike outs, and coasts home to a 12-3 win.

In New York, the Yankees' Bert Daniels triples in the 6th inning, then
steals home, a first in the AL. New York beats the White Sox, 13-4.

McIntire, to help himself to a 5-2 win at the newly refurbished Polo Grounds.

1912
In Chicago, the Cubs beat the Giants and ace Rube Marquard, 7-2, stopping
Rube's remarkable streak. Rube's record is now 19-1. Rube is lifted at the
end of 6 innings with the score, 6-2. He gives up 8 hits and walks 7. The
19 straight wins is the NL record for the 20th century and ties Tim Keefe's
mark of 19 in a row set in 1888.

In Pittsburgh, the Phillies top the Pirates, 5-1, ending Howie Camnitz'
win streak of 7. Alexander is the victor.

1914

on Christy Mathewson.

1915
The Pirates make just 2 assists, both by 2B Jim Viox, in a 9-inning game

the Cincinnati Reds had no assists in a 7-inning game versus the Phils.

1917
The St. Paul Saints defeat Kansas City (AA) in the 2nd game of a doubleheader
to snap KC's win streak at 15 games.

1918
Although Babe Ruth's 10th inning blast over the fence in Fenway scores
Amos Strunk in the Red Sox' win 1-0 over Cleveland, the prevailing rules
about the winning run scoring ahead of the homerun reduce Babe's HR to a
triple. The run gives Sad Sam Jones the win over Stanley Coveleskie. Guy
Morton gives up 3 Boston hits in the nitecap to beat Carl Mays, 4-3. Ruth
will hit 11 homers this year, all on the road.

At the Polo Grounds, the Yankees come from behind to tie the White Sox with 3
runs in the 8th, then win in the 9th, 6-5, on Frank Baker's 100th hit of the
season. Baker is the first player to reach the century mark in hits this year.

In a battle of the top two teams, the Cubs spilt a doubleheader with the
Giants. Behind George Tyler's complete game, Chicago takes the opener from
the visitors, 6-3. Pol Perritt, a loser yesterday, beats the Cubs in the
nitecap, 3-1. Hendrix is the loser.

The A's pound out a 16-9 win over the Tigers, who are playing without Harry
Heilmann. Heilmann is struck by a bat in pregame practice. Three players -
Cobb, McAvoy and Acosta - collect four hits apiece, but Cobb playing 2B
and Bush at short add two errors apiece.

1919
Jack Coombs resigns as manager of the last-place Phils. Slugger Gavvy Cravath,
now leading the NL in hitting, replaces him.

1920
The Indians sweep a doubleheader in Washington winning 4-2 and 9-6, to move
back into first place in the AL. Seldom used Guy Morton wins the opener
with a 5-hitter, and George Uhle takes the second game. The majors' only
player-manager, Tris Speaker, connects for 7 straight singles (5 for 5 in
game 2) in the two games.

At New York, Ty Cobb, out with a wrenched knee since June 6, hits a
pinch single in the 9th to drive home the winner in a victory over the
Yankees. Cobb extends his hit streak to 12 games, while Ruth, who put the
Yanks ahead with a RBI-triple, runs his hit streak to 22 games. New York
scores one in the 9th but loses, 4-3.

1921
In Detroit, RF Harry Heilmann hits a HR off Boston's Joe Bush that the New
York Tribune reports measures 610 feet. The story says the groundskeeper
measured the distance. Heilmann, hitting .413 on July 2, is in the middle
of a 34 for 58 hitting splurge. But Detroit manages just 3 other hits off
Bush in losing, 4-1.

In Chicago, White Sox pitcher Dickie Kerr beats the Yankees 4-1 and steals
home in the 7th inning on the front end of a double steal. Ruth has a pair
of hits.

An order is issued that allows fans to keep balls hit into the stands in
Pittsburgh. Robert Alderdice, Director of Public safety makes the ruling
following threatened damage suits against three policemen who placed three
fans under arrest for refusing to throw balls back on the diamond.

1922
Reds righthander Pete Donohue beats the Phils, 7-1. A 3-time 20-game winner
in 9 years with the Reds, Donohue will beat the Phils 20 straight times.

1924
At Cincinnati, the Phils play 25 innings in a doubleheader without making an
error. The Phils win game 1 in regulation, 3-1, behind Bill Hubbell. The Reds
win the 2nd game, 2-1, in 16 innings when Edd Roush drives in the winner. Eppa
Rixey goes the distance and scores the winning run. From today's game through
July 18, Rixey will throw 31 straight scoreless innings. In the opener,
Hubbell, on instructions from his manager, issues an intentional walk to
Curt Walker by throwing 4 balls to 1B Walt Holke. There is a runner on 3B
at the time. The ump allows this but it is later repudiated by NL president
Heydler who calls it farcical. Heydler will send out a bulletin stating
that the practice is illegal.

1927
Ban Johnson, finally yielding to club owners, retires as American League
president after 34 years of service. The resignation is effective November
1. Johnson, who has been on leave because of health since January, twice
before refused to quit. This time he insists that his compensation should
stop when he does, thus giving up his contract that would run till 1935.

Cubs righthander Charlie Root tosses the first one hitter of the year,
a 1-0 win over Bucs' ace Lee Meadows. Pitt has the top three hitters in
the league (Harris, Waner, Barnhart) but it is C Johnny Gooch's two-out
single in the 8th that breaks the no-hitter. Chicago scores its only run
on a throwing error by Buc's captain Pie Traynor. Root wins his 15th,
and will lead the NL with 26 wins and 309 IP.

The Yanks split with the Tigers, losing the opener 11-8, then outslugging
the Tigers, to win, 10-8. Ruth clouts his 27th homer in the nitecap,
a 3-run inside-the-park drive to deep center, to back George Pipgras'
pitching. The hard drive, off Don Hankins, ricochets off the wall past CF
Heinie Manush, and the Babe scores standing up for his only inside-the-parker
this season. Lil Stoner goes all the way for Detroit in the opener, allowing
14 hits to win. Gehrig, leading the AL with a .401 average, has 4 hits for
the afternoon, but his longest is a triple.

1929
Donie Bush, manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, thinks his fast traveling
Buccaneers may win the NL pennant if the lively ball does not kill or
maim some of his best players. "The Pirate pilot was asked if the ball
is as closely related to a rabbit as has been alleged by some indignant
players. 'It's not a ball, it's a bullet,' said Donie. 'Somebody's going
to get killed if they don't watch out. A pitcher who has to put the ball
over hasn't a chance. All he can do is to pitch and duck.' However, if the
Pirates do not forget to duck, the manager thinks he has a great chance to
win another pennant." (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette)

1930
For the 2nd time in 5 days, the Yankees are shut out. This time the A's Rube
Walberg turns the trick, winning 4-0 in the first game of a doubleheader. It
is the 2nd and last time the Yanks will be shut out this year.

1931

16-5. Ferrell has completed 18 of 20 starts.

1934
At Boston, the A's leadoff hitter Max Bishop collects 8 walks in a
doubleheader, tying his own ML record, as the 3rd-place Red Sox win 7-4 and
7-2. Bishop is the only player to walk more than 6 times in a doubleheader,
and he's done it twice. Foxx hits a pair of homers in the opener, #25 and
#26, while Bob Johnson hits #25 in the same game. Bob Johnson also hits
a fly ball off Red Sox pitcher Hank Johnson, which is caught by center
fielder Roy Johnson.

1935
The AL continues its All-Star Game reign, winning the 3rd event, at
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, 4-1. Jimmie Foxx is the hitting star with a
homer and 3 RBI. Lefty Gomez pitches six outstanding innings for the win,
while Bill Walker takes the loss. Because of Gomez, the rule that no pitcher
can throw more than three innings unless the game goes extra innings will
be instituted.

1939
Prior to the first game of a doubleheader with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium,
a wall of Japanese beetles form in front of the home dugout. Although over

1941
At the All-Star Game at Briggs Stadium, Ted Williams, hitting .405 at the
break, homers off Chicago Cubs P Claude Passeau with two out and 2 on in the
bottom of the 9th inning to give the AL a dramatic 7-5 victory. Williams'
4 RBIs are matched by NL SS Arky Vaughan, who hits HRs in the 7th and
8th. Vaughan is the first player to homer twice in the classic. Joe and
Dom DiMaggio both played for the AL marking the first time that brothers
have appeared in the same All-Star game.

Warren Spahn, 19, pitches his 4th shutout in a row as Evansville (Three I)
edges Madison, 1-0.

1942
The Cards sell veteran P Lon Warneke (6-4) to the Cubs. The Arkansas
Hummingbird was 17-9 last year, but in answer to the fans' protests, Breadon
says, "We let Warneke go because it was apparent that he had lost some of
his stuff." Maybe so. Lon will be 21-24 in Chicago.

1943
At Comiskey Park, Chicago RHP Orval "Righty" Grove has a no-hitter against
the Yankees until, with 1 out to go, Joe Gordon doubles. Grove gets the
next batter for a 1-0 win.

to top the Reds, 1-0. Pinky May singles with 2 outs in the bottom of the
14th to drive home the lone run.

1944
At Boston, the Indians stake Allie Reynolds to a 4-0 lead in the top of
the 1st, but the Chief allows the 1st 4 batters to reach base and exits
with a 3-0 count on Bobby Doerr. Calvert then serves up a HR to Doerr,
and the Hubmen add another 6 runs off Calvert in the 2nd to complete their
scoring for an 11-7 tally. The win goes to Terry and the loss goes to Calvert
under the existing rules. Tribe OF Paul O'Dea throws 3 shutout innings of
relief. Fox has 4 hits for Boston, while Seerey, Keltner and Boudreau (2)
homer for Cleveland.

At Washington, the Browns edge the Senators, 5-4, behind Sig Jakucki. Sig
walks 7, including 3 intentional walks to Stan Spence. Johnny Niggeling
gives up 10 hits and strikes out 10 in losing to the league-leaders.

1945
Filling wartime rosters requires going deeper into the bag. The Dodgers
bring back Babe Herman from California. He pinch-hits twice against the
Cardinals, tripping over 1B on a hit as the Dodgers lose, 6-4. Guy Bush,
Clay Touchstone and Hod Lisenbee, contemporaries of Babe Herman in the 1920s,
will get their chances on the mound. The Babe will go 9 for 34, mostly as
a pinch-hitter, sock one HR, and be a popular gate attraction in Brooklyn.

The Cubs take the NL lead by winning 2 from the Phillies, 12-6 and 9-2. Phil
Cavarretta has 4 hits and 4 RBIs in the opener, as Ray Prim beats Whit
Wyatt. Led by Vance Dinge's 4 hits, the Phils outhit the Cubs in the opener,
17-12. The Cubs never relinquish first place, despite losing 16 of 22 games
to the Cards.

1946
A special meeting of clubs deals with Mexican League defections and attempts
by players to gain new rights. Some results:  $5,000 minimum salary,
$25-per-week training-camp expenses, a fixed period for spring training, 25
days for post-season barnstorming, maximum pay cut of 25 percent. A pension
fund aimed at providing $100 a month for retired 10-year players will be

league will have a player rep to baseball councils. The first player reps
named are Yankees P Johnny Murphy and Dodgers OF Dixie Walker.

1947
Yankee right-hander Spec Shea becomes the first rookie to win an All-Star
game. The 26-year-old 'Naugatuck Nugget' tosses three solid innings in the
American League's 2-1 victory at Wrigley Field, but his appearance in the
Mid-summer Classic leads to a sore arm limiting his effectiveness as a starter
for the Bronx Bombers. Clutch pinch hits by Luke Appling and Stan Spence
lead the AL. Schoolboy Rowe pinch-hits for Johnny Sain, becoming the first
player to appear for each side. Rowe pitched 3 innings for the AL in 1936.

wins, 4-0.

are the first blacks to play for the Giants. Thompson, who was also the
first black to play for the St. Louis Browns in 1947 (twelve days after
Larry Doby's American League debut), starts at 2B, and Irvin pinch-hits
in the 8th for Hartung. When Thompson steps in against Don Newcombe, it is
the first time in ML history that a black pitcher and a black hitter have
faced off. The Dodgers win, 4-3.

At Shibe Park, the Phils tie the Braves with 2 outs in the 9th when Granny
Hamner doubles home Ashburn to knot the game 1-1. Both teams score twice in
the 11th, and in the 13th Boston baserunner Alvin Dark is knocked unconscious
by a ball thrown by Hamner. Dark is carried off the field on a stretcher
and taken to Temple University Hospital. Del Crandall's sac fly in the 16th
off Schoolboy Rowe wins it, 4-3, for Boston. The game ends at 1:01 a.m.,
the latest game to date in the NL.

1950
At Forbes Field, Red Schoendienst of the Cards goes 5 for 5 against
Pittsburgh, but the Cards lose 7-6, to drop the Birds into 2nd place, a game
behind the Phillies. The Bucs win in the 9th when they load the bases and
a long fly by Jack Phillips (pinch-hitting for Murry Dickson) is seemingly
snagged by Stan Musial, but then drops into Greenberg Gardens for a pinch
grand slam. Kiner and Rojek also homer for the Corsairs. Phillips, a 28-year
utility infielder, will go deep only nine times in 892 major league at-bats.

1951
The feud between Joe DiMaggio and Casey Stengel reaches a head in the 2nd
inning against the Red Sox. Because of a misplay in the first, Stengel

Cubs Bob Rush in Philadelphia. The game is ended after 5 innings because of

aboard in the 4th proves to be the deciding run. Shantz strikes out the side
in the 5th, whiffing Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial. Lon
Warneke umps his first All-Star game after pitching in three in the 1930s.

1953

1959
During the All-Star break, the Reds fire manager Mayo Smith (35-45) and

is the team's fourth manager in less than a year.

1960
The Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro brings an end to Havana's
