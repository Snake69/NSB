1903
Sue for non-support. In game 1 against the White Sox, Detroit's Bill Donovan
emerges with a 1-0 win. He'll lose an AL record five 1-0 games this year,
a mark only tied in the loop by Jack Warhop in 1914, and no ML pitcher will
lose six 1-0 decisions. Frank Owen takes the loss for Chicago, giving up
a run in the first. Detroit loses the nitecap, 4-2.

1907
Cleveland wins a pair over the New York Highlanders, 7-5 and 8-3, to move a
half game behind the league-leading Chicago White Sox. The Sox lose today,
4-3, to the A's. Highlander's Hal Chase has his 33-game hit streak stopped
in game 1. It began on June 24. It is the AL-record until Cobb will top it.

1911
In a 7-6 loss to St. Louis, the league-leading Phils are dealt a blow when
catcher-manager Red Dooin suffers a broken leg in a collision at home plate
with Cards runner Rebel Oakes.

Christy Mathewson wins his 21st straight game from the Reds, 5-3. He replaces
Hooks Wiltse in the 8th and his single in the 9th scores a run to help win it.

1912
In an accommodation to the Wall Street crowd, the Giants open their home
stand with a 3:45 game against the Cubs. But the Cubs score 3 in the 8th
off Mathewson to win, 4-2.

1914
Boston rookie Ernie Shore stops the Naps in Cleveland, 4-1.

1916
Tigers favorite Harry Heilmann gets an appreciative hand from the crowd
for having dived into the Detroit River last night to save a woman from
drowning. The Tigers then beat Washington, 6-5.

1918
That's spelled Steal. Giants pitcher Bob Steele tosses a 7-hit shutout over
the Cardinals to win 8-0. In the 6-run 7th, Steele steals home. The Giants
are now 2 games in back of the Cubs, losers today to the Phils.

1920
Caution pays off as Sam Jones walks Ruth four times and fires a three-hitter
at 2nd place New York. The Red Sox win, 9-0.

1922
In several pregame fights between Yankees teammates, Bob Meusel and Wally
Schang duke it out in the dugout. Then Babe Ruth and Wally Pipp take a
turn. The players then turn on the Browns, beating them 11-6. Ruth bangs
two homers, Pipp adds another, and Schang chips in with a two-run triple.

1924
At Chicago, Babe Ruth strikes out with the sacks full in the 9th, then
belts a game-winning HR in the 14th, off Sam Jones, to give the Yankees a
5-4 win over the Sox.

1926
Athletics ace Eddie Rommel shuts out the Red Sox, 5-0, in the only AL game
played today.

1927
Max Carey, who played 17 years with the Pirates before he was dismissed,
returns to Pittsburgh in a Dodgers uniform and makes a clean steal of home
in the 6th inning. It is his 33rd and last steal of home, an NL record. He
has 3 hits and 3 steals in the game, but the Pirates score the tying and
winning runs in the 8th and win, 6-5.

1928
At Navin Field in Detroit, Detroit rookie righthander Vic Sorrell and the
Yankees' Waite Hoyt are 1-1 after 11. Twelve hits and 2 walks in the 12th,
all off Sorrell, score eleven New York runs to set a ML record for the
biggest extra-inning storm ever for the inning (the same two combined for
11 runs in the 12th inning on May 14, 1923 ... NY - 8, Det - 3, which is a
record for 2 teams). For the 3rd time, Yankee Bob Meusel hits for the cycle,
a major league record that only Babe Herman in the NL will tie. Detroit takes
the nitecap, outslugging New York, 13-10. Harry Heilmann hits a grand slam
in the 2nd, and adds a triple and single to drive in 8 runs. Earl Whitehill
is the winner, though reliever Elam Vangilder belts a homer.

Carl Hubbell makes his ML debut, against the Pirates. He pitches a scoreless
1st inning, but the Pirates score 5 in the 2nd to knock him out. Pittsburgh
wins, 7-5, behind Burleigh Grimes.

The Phils buy left-handed hitting OF Chuck Klein from Fort Wayne.

The first place Cards beat the Robins again, 6-1, behind Pete Alexander's
pitching. Alex adds 3 singles while Frankie Frisch, Taylor Douthit and
George Harper hit homers.

1930
Phils pitchers continue their consistency, giving up 5 HRs to the Cubs in a
16-2 pasting. Hack Wilson has 3 of the homers, increasing his total to 32,
while Gabby Hartnett and winning pitcher Pat Malone add the other two. Phil
Collins, the ace of the weak Phillies staff, is routed by the 9-run attack
in the first two innings.

At the Polo Grounds, Bill Terry collects a double and two homers to
lead the Giants to a 10-4 come-from-behind win over the Pirates. Memphis
Bill's 2nd homer is inside-the-park against Erv Brame, the loser to Fred
Fitzsimmons. Giants manager John McGraw, who skips the game to look over the
Montreal Royals in Canada, opines, "This lively ball is hurting baseball. I
think the club owners ought to get together on it. I suppose six out of eight
teams in each league would like to see it go. It has taken the confidence out
of pitchers. The ball is so lively that fielders cannot handle it and throw
it to the plate. Bunting is gone - the ball is too lively. And baserunning has
disappeared. The public liked that. Those plays were always close." Flubber??

At Boston, 33,000 fans are on hand for Rabbit Maranville Day and to watch
the Braves play a doubleheader with the Cardinals. The captain-shortstop
receives numerous gifts between games, including a car, a chest of silver
and a $1,000 in gold. A three-run rally in the 8th by St. Louis wins the
opener, 5-4, for Burleigh Grimes. The Braves win the nitecap, 6-5, behind
sterling relief work by Bob Smith. Cards acting manager Frankie Frisch has
4 hits and a stolen base in game 2.

1931
The Yankees split a doubleheader with the White Sox, taking the 2nd game
22-5 with a ML record-tying 9 players scoring 2 or more runs each. Pat
Caraway, who had given up 11 runs to Boston in 4 2/3 innings on the 23rd,
is hit hard in the debacle, the worst loss in Sox history. Chicago wins the
opener, 5-4, despite collecting just 5 hits off Henry Johnson. One of the
hits is a HR by Lu Blue in the 3rd inning, his first and only homer in his
2 seasons in a Chicago uniform. But Lu will collect 127 walks this year,
a club mark not topped until another 1B, Frank Thomas, does it in 1991.

At Cleveland, the Tribe ends the A's 13-game win streak with a 13-2
victory. Earl Averill's HR and Burnett's 5 hits lead a 19-hit attack and
pins Waite Hoyt with his first A's loss.

1933
Rogers Hornsby swaps St. Louis uniforms, leaving the Cards to manage the
Browns. The Rajah takes the place of Allen Sothoron on the 29th.

The 61-game batting streak of San Francisco's (PCL) 18-year-old rookie,
Joe DiMaggio, is stopped by Ed Walsh Jr of Oakland. Joe's streak breaks the
PCL mark of 49, set by Jack Ness in 1915. DiMaggio hit .405 (104 for 257)
during the skein. Walsh will stop the Seals again on August 17, pitching
a 5-0 no-hitter.

Lou Gehrig is thrown out of the second game in a doubleheader, a 9-4 loss
against Boston. Bill Summers tosses him in the 4th for excessively riding
the umps. Had it been the first game, Lou's consecutive-game streak would
have ended. New York wins the first game, 2-0.

1934
Sad Sam Jones of the White Sox celebrates his 42nd birthday and his 18th
wedding anniversary by white washing the Senators, 9-0.

Dizzy Dean and Carl Hubbell confront one another for the 3rd time. Hubbell
loses for the 3rd time, 7-2, but it is Paul Dean in relief who is the winner.

1935
Jesse Hill's line drive bounces off the head of P Ed Linke back to C Jack
Redmond on the fly, who throws to 2B to double off Ben Chapman. Linke will
be hospitalized for 2 days. But the Senators knock the Yankees out of first
for the first time since May 30, 9-3. Heinie Manush leads the Nats offense
with 2 homers, one a grand slam.

1936
Umpire Bill Summers is forced out of the game after he was hit in the groin
by a pop bottle thrown from an unruly crowd of 50,000 at Comiskey Park. The
crowd is upset with an out call at 1B on Ray Radcliff in the 8th of the
nitecap. Judge Landis, on hand to watch the game, offers a $5,000 reward
over the PA system for the culprit, but only draws more boos. The deluge
of pop bottles finally abates when Jimmy Dykes pleads through the field
amplifier. The Yanks sweep a pair from the Sox, winning 12-3 and 11-8
in 11 innings. Gehrig hits his 29th with two aboard to start New York's
scoring in the opener. DiMaggio and Lazzeri add round trippers to make it
easy for Johnny Broaca. Sugar Cain is the losing pitcher. In the nitecap,
Gehrig adds another homer, while Zeke Bonura homers and drives home 4 runs
for the Sox. DiMaggio has one hit, a triple. The sweep increases New York's
lead to 9 1/2 games. Landis will state tomorrow that he is considering a
ruling that all beverages be served in a paper cup.

The Tigers strand 14 runners and lose to Boston and Wes Ferrell, 10-3. The
Tigers have 13 hits including Goose Goslin with 3 for 3. Jimmy Foxx hits his
28th homer of the year in Boston's 5-run 8th, then hits another in the 9th,
to pin the loss on Eldon Auker.

Before a paid attendance of 41,596 in Boston - the largest crowd in the
NL since 1930 - the Cards and Bees split. The Bees take the opener, 4-3,
on Wally Berger's two run homer in the 8th inning off Jess Haines. The
nitecap is knotted at 2-2 in the 7th, when the Cards unload 5 runs. Joe
Medwick leads off the frame with a homer, Johnny Mize doubles, and Virgil
Davis homers to knock out Ben Cantwell. After two more reach base, Dizzy
Dean drives them both home to ensure his 16th win of the year. Dean adds
a run-scoring triple in the 3rd as well.

Bucky Walters allows just two hits in beating the Cubs, 4-0, in the first
of two games. The Cubs roll in game 2, winning 18-5, as Frank Demaree has 5
hits including two homers. Auglie Galan, Stan Hack, Ethan Allen and pitcher
Lon Warneke also hit homers.

The Giants score 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Reds,
5-4. Helping the victory is a 4th inning triple play started when LF Hank
Lieber makes a brilliant catch near the left-CF wall.

1937
Mickey Cochrane resumes command of the Detroit Tigers as a bench manager.

1939

homers. Red Ruffing coasts to the win, allowing 3 Brownie safeties.

1940
New York P Spud Chandler beats the White Sox with his bat, knocking in 6
runs with a single and 2 HRs, one a grand slam off Pete Appleton. The 6
RBIs by a pitcher ties the ML record held by Appleton, George Uhle and Wes
Ferrell. Joe Gordon also hits a homer, his 7th in 8 games. Tonight's game was
the last night game for New York this year ... their record after dark is 3-2.

1941
The Yankees roll over the White Sox, 11-3, collecting 14 hits. But Sox
reliever Johnny Hallett strikes out Joe DiMaggio in the 6th, the first K
for Joe since June 8.

The Cards' Ernie White wins his 4th game in 5 days, a 20th century ML
record, stopping the Braves, 9-2. His other wins, all in relief, were over
the Giants on July 22, 23 and 24, also a record.

1942
Clyde McCullough hits 3 consecutive HRs, but the Chicago Cubs lose, 4-3,
to Philadelphia Phillies in game one. The Phils also take the nitecap,
6-1. McCullough will end the year with 5 homers.

1946
In a move that foreshadows Bill Veeck's use of Eddie Gaedel, the Indians
try and use a midget at third base. With Ted Williams about to step in the
batters box at Fenway, the Indians move into the Williams shift. Three-foot
tall Marco Songini runs onto the field and takes over the empty third base
spot. The umps then wave him off. The Red Sox win, 5-1.

Monty Stratton, who lost a leg in a hunting accident in 1938, wins his 14th
game for Sherman (East Texas League). He will finish with 18 victories for
the second-division team.

At Chanute (Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri League), Chanute beats Iola, 14-3, as
Ross Grimsley of Chanute strikes out 18 batters. Grimsley will have a cup
of coffee with the White Sox in 1951, but his son will star for the Orioles.

1948
The Bambino makes his final public appearance at the New York premiere of
The Babe Ruth Story. The Sultan of Swat will die three weeks later.

13-4. Preacher Roe is the losing pitcher while Sheldon Jones takes the
victory.

1949
Vern Stephens of the Red Sox smacks a homer and a double in the 8th inning

In a 5-4 win over St. Louis, A's vet Wally Moses gets his 2,000th hit,
off Joe Ostrowski of the Browns.

1950
Brooklyn beats the Cardinals, 7-5, as the Dodgers' Jim Russell switch-hits
HRs, making him the first switch-hitter in history to do it more than
once. Stan Musial hits in his 30th straight game, the longest streak of
the decade. He is enroute to a .346 BA for the season and his 4th batting
title. The Cards, currently 1 1/2 games behind Brooklyn, will begin a slow
and steady descent to 5th place.

1951
In a 9-1 victory over the Cubs at Wrigley Field, Jim Russell becomes the
the first player in major league history, to hit a homerun from both sides
of the plate in two different games. The Dodger outfielder's accomplishment
will be surpassed in 1956 when Yankee slugger Mickey Mantle goes deep both
right and left-handed in the same game for a third time.

At Fenway, Clyde Vollmer knocks in 6 runs on 3 homers to lead the Red Sox
to a 13-10 win over the sliding White Sox. His last homer, a 3-run shot,
breaks a 10-10 tie.

1952
Mantle again supplies the Yankees fire power, hitting a grand slam into
the left-CF upper deck at Briggs Stadium off Ted Gray, but again New York
loses. Detroit wins 10-6 in 11 innings and again it is Steve Souchock

to Gray.

down the Braves, 6-4.

1953
At Briggs Stadium, the crowd of 49,717 is treated to a pair of Tiger victories

reaching Al Aber in the first game and Steve Gromek in the nitecap.

1954
Brooklyn defeats Giant stalwart Sal Maglie in Ebbets Field, roughing him

has recorded 10 straight victories in the Brooklyn ball park.

1955
The Yankees release pitcher Ted Gray, who will be signed by Baltimore, his
4th AL team this year. Just 2 other players have played for 4 AL teams in
one season.

1956
The Braves win their 9th straight at the Polo Grounds, defeating the Giants,
11-0, and increasing their NL leads to 5 1/2 games. Elongated righty Gene
Conley is the winner. Aaron and Thomson hit homers, the 8th straight game
the Braves have had 2 or more homers.

1957

was coming off 3 straight shutouts at the hands of the Dodgers.

1961
John Blanchard ties a ML record by hitting his 3rd and 4th HRs in 4 at bats
over 3 games. He drives in 4 of the Yankee runs in a 5-2 victory over the
White Sox at the Stadium. New York manages just 6 hits but 4 are homers,
including one by Mantle following Blanchard's first-inning clout. Blanchard
will end the year with 21 homers in 243 at-bats, the first player in history
to hit 20 or more in fewer than 250 at-bats.

At Milwaukee, the Reds muscle 3 runs in the 8th inning to beat the Braves,
3-2. Gus Bell rings a pinch homer and Frank Robinson clubs a two-run homer
for the Reds.

1962
Braves hurler Warren Spahn homers off Craig Anderson of the Mets to set

career homerun helps Milwaukee to extend New York's losing streak to 11
with a 6-1 Milwaukee win.

In New York, P Gene Conley and IF Pumpsie Green of the Red Sox mysteriously
disappear after a 13-3 loss to the Yankees. They leave the team bus in traffic
to use a rest room and fail to return. Conley decides he wants to fly to
Israel, and goes to the airport, but is refused a ticket because he does
not have a visa. Conley was the loser in the game, pitching 2 2/3 innings,
and walking in 2 of the 8 earned runs allowed. Pumpsie did not play. Bouton
is the winner, shutting out the Hubmen for 6 innings.

1964
LF Tony Conigliaro suffers a broken arm in a 6-1 Boston win at Cleveland.

Worthington wins over Thad Tillotson in 4 hours 20 minutes.

1968
Leaving with a strained knee after 5 innings of pitching, Earl Wilson of the
Tigers earns a 4-1 win in the opener of three games with the Orioles. Rookie
Daryl Patterson provides spectacular relief coming in with the bases loaded in
the 6th and striking out the side. Powell's homer in the 8th is the only tally
for the O's. The win increases the Tigers lead over the O's to 6 1/2 games.

1970
Johnny Bench of the Reds and Orlando Cepeda of the Braves each collect 3
consecutive homers and 7 RBIs during respective games with the Cardinals
and Cubs. Bench hits all 3 off Steve Carlton and adds a single in the Reds'
12-5 win over the Cards. Bench now has 33 homers and 95 RBIs to lead the
majors. Cepeda collects his 7 RBIs in the Braves' 8-3 win over the Cubs
in game 1. His first 2 are solo shots, and the 3rd follows an intentional
walk to Aaron to load the bases. His last RBI comes on a single in the

Cepeda and Tony Perez had been the co-leaders with 379.

1999
Major league umpires file suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia for
the right to withdraw their mass resignations. So far, 14 of the 56 umps
who "resigned" have withdrawn their resignations. Resignations from 9 of
the AL umps are accepted by the league.

The Red Sox obtain OF Butch Huskey from the Mariners for minor league P
Robert Ramsey.

Braves C Javy Lopez is put on the DL after injuring his right knee. He will
miss the remainder of the season.

The Diamondbacks bring up Mexican star Erubiel Durazo, 25, to replace
slumping 1B Travis Lee. Durazo, whose contract was purchased from the
Monterrey Sultans last December after he hit .350, tore up the minors (AA
El Paso, .403, 14 HR in 64 games; AAA Tucson, .407, 10 HR, 30 games). He'll
do the same in the majors hitting .329 and 11 homers in 52 games.

2000
The Phillies send their number-one starter, Curt Schilling, to Arizona for
first baseman-outfielder Travis Lee and pitchers Omar Daal, Vicente Padilla
and Nelson Figueroa.

The Blue Jays defeat the Indians, 8-1, as David Wells wins his major
league-leading 16th game. Bartolo Colon takes the loss for Cleveland, despite
striking out the first 6 batters to face him to tie Bob Feller's team record.

The Dodgers obtain oft-injured P Ismael Valdes from the Cubs for minor
leaguers Jamie Arnold and Jorge Piedra. The Dodgers swapped Valdes to the
Cubs last year. Piedra was a top prospect in 1998, hitting .383 at Great
Falls, while reaching base in 54 straight games.

2001
Rookie P Chris George, 21, becomes the 1st lefthander to start for KC
in 239 games. He loses to the Mariners, 4-0. The winner is Joel Piniero,
who allows one hit in 6 innings to win his first ML decision.

The White Sox send P James Baldwin to the Dodgers for 3 minor leaguers -
pitchers Onan Masaoka and Gary Majewski, and OF Jeff Barry.

2002
The Rangers defeat the Athletics, 12-4, as Carl Everett becomes the first
Ranger ever to homer twice in the same inning. He does so in Texas' 9-run 7th.

2003
The Indians score 8 runs in the 2nd inning and go on to defeat the Mariners,
9-2.

2004
The Diamondbacks beat Houston, 4-1, behind Brandon Webb, snapping their
losing streak at 14 games. The D'Backs had a losing streak of 11 games in
June, making them the first team since the 1962 Mets to fashion two losing
streaks of that length in the same year.

The Brewers get IF-OF Russell Branyan from the Indians for future
considerations.

2005
After waiting through a 2-hour 43-minute rain delay in Chicago to start the
game, Greg Maddux becomes the 13th pitcher in baseball history to register
3,000 strikeouts. Taking an inside fastball in the top of the third inning,
Omar Vizquel of the Giants becomes the historic victim of the 39-year-old
Cubs right-hander.

2006
The Indians send 1B Ben Broussard and cash to the Mariners for OF Shin-Soo
Choo and a player to be named.

2010
Allowing only a second-inning walk to Brennan Boesch, who is promptly erased
on a double play, Matt Garza faces the minimum 27 batters in his no-hitter
against the Tigers. With the right-hander's 5-0 victory, the Rays join
the 1917 Browns and White Sox as the only teams to be involved in three
no-hitters in the same season.

2011
The 19-inning 6-hour 39-minute game between the Pirates and Braves at Turner
Field ends in a 4-3 Atlanta victory when Jerry Meals makes one of the worst
calls in baseball history. The home plate umpire rules that Michael McKenry
had missed Julio Lugo, although it was evident to everyone in the ballpark
that the base runner was tagged out three feet in front of the dish.

With a 9-2 victory in New York, the Mariners post their first win since
July 5 to end their 17-game losing streak, a franchise record. Seattle's
recent futility surpassed the team's previous longest winless drought,
which consisted of 14 consecutive defeats in 1992.

2012
After hitting a long fly ball down the left-field line at Citizens Bank
Park, Carlos Gomez completes his homerun trot around the bases. Arriving
at home plate, he is made aware that the ball was called foul, and then the
embarrassed Brewers center fielder promptly takes a called third strike on
a pitch thrown right down the middle.

Starling Marte becomes the 28th player in history to homer on the first
pitch he sees in the major leagues when he goes yard to deep left-center
field at Minute Maid Park off Houston's Dallas Keuchel. The 23-year-old
left fielder is the first Pirates player to hit a homerun in his first big
league at-bat since Don Leppert accomplished the feat in 1961.

Matt Harvey establishes a Mets record for strikeouts in his major league
debut when he fans 11 batters in team's 3-1 victory over Arizona at Chase
Field. In his 5 1/3 innings on the mound, the rookie right-hander gives up
three hits, while collecting two hits in the batter's box.

2013
The Cubs trade Alfonso Soriano, along with cash, to the Yankees in
exchange for minor-leaguer Corey Black, a 21-year-old right-handed pitching
prospect. The 37-year-old Dominican left fielder made his major league debut
with the Bronx Bombers in 1999, developing into an All-star second baseman,
before being traded to Texas four seasons later as part of a blockbuster
deal that brought Alex Rodriguez to New York.
