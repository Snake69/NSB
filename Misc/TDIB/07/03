1906
At Cleveland, the Naps top the Tigers, 5-0, in a game called after 6
innings on account of rain. To underscore the soggy conditions, Detroit
outfielder Germany Schaefer plays the last few innings wearing a raincoat
over his uniform.

1909
Seventeen Cardinals commit errors in a doubleheader loss to the Reds,
10-2 and 13-7, to tie a modern ML record.

At a packed Washington Park, the Giants beat up Brooklyn, winning 5-3 and 2-1
in a total of 23 innings. In the opener, Mathewson relieves Bugs Raymond with
the score knotted at 3-3 in the 9th. Matty shuts out the Superbas in the next
6 innings, and the Giants score 2 in the 14th off Harry McIntire for the win.

The Browns' Bill Dinneen allows 2 hits in shutting out the White Sox, 4-0.

to win, 7-3. New York holds a one-game lead over the Cubs.

At Philadelphia, the A's Frank Baker hits for the cycle in a 5-1 win over
the Yankees in game 2 of a doubleheader.

1912
The Giants' Rube Marquard nips Nap Rucker 2-1 to capture his 19th straight
game this season. With two end-of-year wins in 1911, the 25-year-old
future Hall of Famer has 21 in a row in regular season play. Both marks
are records. On the 8th, the Cubs will beat him, but he will ultimately
compile a league-leading 26 victories against 11 defeats. Today's game is
the Giants' 16th consecutive win. Brooklyn will end the streak tomorrow.

After a first game 3-2 victory, Walter Johnson picks up a win in game 2
and is given a rare rest in the 6th inning as Washington coasts to a 10-2
win over the Yankees. Johnson will rack up an AL record 16 straight wins
before he is beaten. The Senators are in the middle of a six-game sweep of
the Yankees, including another pair tomorrow.

1913
The Red Sox tally 15 hits off Washington's Walter Johnson, but lose 1-0 in
15 innings. This ties a ML record of frustration for most hits in an extra
inning shutout. Ray Collins takes the loss.

The Giants hand Pete Alexander his 3rd loss in the 4-game series with the
Phillies, as Jeff Tesreau wins, 4-2, in 11 innings. New York is now in
first place by 3 1/2 games.

1914
Chief Bender and Bob Shawkey whitewash the Yankees, 2-0 and 1-0, for an
A's sweep.

The Braves make their 2nd trade in 4 days acquiring OF Josh Devore from
the Phils for INF Jack Martin.

At Washington, it's Johnson versus Johnson in game 1, with Walter beating
Boston's Adam, 12-0. Adam leaves after 4 innings. Rip Williams is the big
hitter for the Nationals with a double, triple and homer. Smoky Joe Wood
wins the nitecap, 3-1, and he singles and scores in the 2-run 10th inning
for the Sox.

1915
The Browns beat the Indians, 3-1, behind George Sisler. Sisler walks 9 and
strikes out the same number in pitching a complete game victory. He allows
7 hits. Cleveland comes back in game 2 of the doubleheader to win 5-1.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

The Red Sox split with the A's, losing the first game 7-3, before taking
the nitecap, 11-0. Jack Barry makes his first appearance for the Sox,
playing the final two innings against his old mates.

1916
Ray Caldwell of the Yankees tosses an 11-inning shutout to defeat Washington's
Walter Johnson.

1917
After managing for 5 games, Honus Wagner resigns as manager. Czech born Hugo
Bezdek is named as his replacement, his qualifications including being the
football coach at Penn State.

1918
Babe Ruth announces that he has joined the Chester team of the Delaware
River Shipbuilding League and will not play for Boston. The Red Sox players
are unperturbed and the Red Sox management threatens an injunction. Heinie
Wagner tracks down the Babe in Baltimore and convinces him to return to
the Sox. Meanwhile, the Ruth-less Sox unravel, losing 6-0 to the A's Vean
Gregg. Gregg allows just one hit in the first six innings, and four overall.

The first-place Cubs finally lose a game to the last-place Cards, 2-1,
in St. Louis. With the score tied, Bob Fisher singles in the 8th, steals
2B and 3B, and scores on Charlie Grimm's single. Fisher helps again in the
9th inning when he nabs Dode Paskert at 2B with a hidden ball trick.

Giants pitcher Fred Anderson follows in the footsteps of Jeff Tesreau and
jumps the team to join a shipyard team. Anderson has been trying to join the
Navy's dental corp, and the Giants don't know his whereabouts. He'll rejoin
the team, however. The Giants are also unsuccessful in luring back Dave
Robertson from government service in Norfolk. Robertson, the NL's co-leader
in homers in 1916-17, turns down an offer of $7,500 and will not rejoin
the Giants until next year. The players aren't needed today as the Giants
sweep a pair from the Dodgers, 9-4 and 1-0, to move to two back of the Cubs.

1920
In Philadelphia, Connie Mack sets up a meeting between Yankee pitcher Carl
Mays and Bryan Hayes, the fan who filed a complaint against Mays for hitting
him with a ball last year. Mays apologizes and Hayes withdraws his complaint,
which has kept the pitcher from appearing in Philley for over a year. Mays
also apologizes before today's A's-Yankees game to the 16,000 fans, then
shuts out the last place "Apathetics," 5-0 in 1 hour 23 minutes. Rip Collins
makes it a sweep by beating the A's, 4-2 on a 4 hitter. Rip has two hits,
while Ruth has 4 hits for the afternoon. Scott Perry takes the loss in game 1.

The slumping Robins lose to last place Philadelphia, 5-2 to drop three
games behind the Reds, winners over the visiting Cubs, 5-3. Chicago also
loses catcher Bill Killefer when he is badly cut in the face when a foul
tip breaks his mask. Killefer has already missed a month with a broken finger.

1921
In the Browns' 5-1 loss to the White Sox, Jim Riley makes his ML debut,
replacing Jimmy Austin late in the game. The Canadian Riley will go hitless
in four games with the Browns and a couple with the Senators, but will finish
second next year in scoring in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. Riley
will make his NHL debut with the Chicago Black Hawks on January 19, 1927. He
is the only athlete to play in both the major leagues and the NHL (as noted
by Jeff Obermeyer).

1922
Bob Meusel hits for the cycle for the 2nd time in his career to pace
the Yankees to a 12-1 whipping of the Athletics. Meusel and Ruth go
back-to-back in the 7th as Carl Mays cruises to his 22nd straight win over
the Athletics. As noted by historian Ted Farmer, all of the wins have been
complete games.

1923
For the 2nd time this season, Babe Ruth clouts a game-winning homer in the
15th inning, this one off former Yankee George Mogridge. The Yankees beat
the Senators, 2-1. The winner is Joe Bush, who pitches all 15 innings and
accounts for the other New York run with a homer.

1925
Dodgers second baseman Milt Stock sets a National League mark by having
his fourth consecutive four-hit game.

In a 6-3 win over the Giants, Brooklyn 2B Milt Stock sets a modern NL record
by getting 4 hits in his 4th consecutive game.

Traynor has a homer and double in one inning for the Bucs.

At Cleveland, George Uhle shrugs off a first inning steal of home by Ty
Cobb to beat the Tigers, 7-5.

1927
In Washington, Ruth crushes a 1st-inning homerun into the far centerfield
seats, the longest clout ever seen at Griffith Stadium, and tips his cap to
the applauding crowd. Not till Mantle will a ball be hit there farther. Goslin
matches him in the first inning and Lazzeri in the 8th. Washington beats
the Yanks, 6-5, to run their win streak to 10 games. Ruth and Gehrig are
now tied for the AL lead with 24 homers.

The Pirates lead is cut to a half game over the Cubs when the Reds edge
Pittsburgh, 5-4. Buc SS Joe Cronin makes 3 errors - all high throws -
in the 6th to allow 3 runs to score.

1928
At Boston, Phils P Alex Ferguson shuts out the Braves to win 15-0. It is the
first shutout for the Phillies pitching staff this season. Boston veteran
George Sisler tosses a last scoreless inning against the Phils.

1929
The Cubs and Reds turn 9 double plays, tying the Detroit-Washington 1925
mark for a regulation game and setting the NL mark (tied in 1961). The 7-5
Chicago win is their 7th in a row (with one tie in the middle), giving them
a half-game lead over the Pirates. The AL mark of 9 DPs will be broken by
the Twins-Red Sox in 1990 (10).

Chicago's Carl Reynolds swipes home in the 10th inning against the Indians
as the Sox score 3 to win, 6-3. Wes Ferrell is the losing pitcher against
reliever McKain.

Babe Ruth belts a grand slam, off Red Ruffing, in the 7th as the Yanks
rally to beat the visiting Red Sox, 6-5. Reliever Lefty Heimach wins his
own game with an inside-the-park homer in the 8th inning. Losing pitcher
Red Ruffing also hits a homerun.

1932
At Wrigley, the Pirates take over first place from the Cubs, beating Chicago
5-4 in 6 innings of drizzle. Vince Barton opens the 6th with a homer off
Heine Meine but the Cubs leave the tying run on base as rain stops play. Pat
Malone takes the loss.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants top the Braves, 5-2, as Carl Hubbell goes
all the way for the win. Frank Hogan crashes his 3rd homer, off Bob Brown,
in three days, to start the scoring in the 2nd. The Braves get 4 hits in
the 6th inning, including a leadoff homer by Wally Berger.

The Red Sox host the Yankees in the first Sunday game ever played at Fenway
(a Boston law had restricted games within 1000 feet of a church on Sundays),
and the Yankees turn a 4-2 game into a rout. They spray 10 hits and score
9 in the 6th inning to win 13-2. George Pipgras gets two singles in the
6th and allows five hits and 8 walks to win. Ben Chapman has a single and
a bases-loaded triple, while Earl Combs and Lyn Lary each hit two doubles
in the frame. Ivy Andrews is hung with the loss.

The Reds slam three triples in the 7th inning off Tex Carleton to overcome
the Cardinals, 4-2. Crabtree, Hendrick and Lombardi leg it around to third,
while Hendrick has three other hits to back Si Johnson's 8-hitter.

1934
At Pittsburgh, Red Lucas makes his 100th consecutive start without being
relieved as the Pirates coast to a win, 10-0, over the Reds. Red allows
6 hits.

Boston snaps the Yankees' 8-game winning streak by edging the Bombers, 10-9,
in 11 innings. Roy Johnson hits a 2-run HR off Johnny Murphy to win. Gehrig,
Werber, Chapman and Crosetti also homer in the game at Yankee Stadium.

1935
To cut their payroll, the Cubs drop Kiki Cuyler. He will sign with the Reds
2 days later. Today, the Reds trip the Cubs, 4-3, when Ernie Lombardi hits
a HR in the 10th at Crosley Field.

In the Giants' 4-3 ten-inning loss to the Phils, Giants SS Dick Bartell
has no fielding chances. Carl Hubbell is the loser.

1938
The Yankees pound out four homers - three off loser Wes Ferrell - to whip
the Senators, 12-2, for their 7th straight win. Joe DiMaggio leads the
attack with a triple, two singles and a homer to drive in 4 runs. New York
now trails the Indians by two games.

1939
Cleveland's Ben Chapman tallies 3 triples, tying the ML record, as Bob
Feller notches his 13th victory, 4-2, over host Detroit. The next American
Leaguer with 3 triples in a game will be Bert Campaneris in 1967.

Cardinal first baseman Johnny Mize equals a NL record with 4 extra-base hits
- double, triple and 2 HRs - and accumulates 13 total bases in the Cards'
5-3 win over the Cubs at Wrigley Field.

1940
At the Polo Grounds, the Dodgers tie the Giants 3-3 in the 9th, then Pee
Wee Reese's grand slam gives the Dodgers a 7-3 win.

Paced by a Jimmie Foxx homerun, the Red Sox score 6 in the 9th to defeat
the A's, 12-11, to erase a 7-run deficit after the 7th. Williams and Tabor
clout 3-run homers, with Ted's tying the game. Cronin also homers for the
Hubmen, while Sam Chapman (2) and Siebert homer for the A's.

1941
At Philley, the Red Sox win, 5-2, over the A's as Lefty Grove scatters 10
hits to win. For Lefty (6-2), it is his 299th win. Ted Williams hits his
16th homer.

1943
In a night game in Cleveland, Leon Culberson cycles to lead the Red Sox
to a 12-4 win over the Indians. Joe Dobson starts for the Red Sox, but
41-year-old Al Simmons pinch hits for him in the 6th, and Mike Ryba then
wins in relief. Culberson is the 4th AL rookie - and the 3rd Sox rookie -
to hit for the cycle. It is also the first night cycle in ML history.

In Detroit, the royalty have the day, as the Tigers sweep a pair from New
York. "Prince Hal" Newhouser pitches the opener, a 6-5 win. In the nitecap,
the Tigers win a 10-9 slugfest. Reliever Hank "Prince" Oana, brought up last
month, wins his first ML decision and belts a 3-run homer, his only ML dinger,
off losing pitcher Atley Donald. The Hawaiian-born Oana came up briefly with
the Phillies in 1934 as an outfielder but converted to pitching last year,
and went 16-5 with Ft. Worth (Texas League).

1945
At Braves Field, the Cubs tie a ML record when Phil Cavarretta, Don Johnson
and Stan Hack each score 5 times as Chicago pummels the Braves 24-2. For
Chicago, it is the most runs scored this century. Johnson has 5 hits, as does
Cavarretta, who adds 5 ribbies. Starter Claude Passeau is the beneficiary of
all the offense-by-the-infield (16 runs scored) support. Tommy Holmes, hitting
in his 30th straight game, is 3 for 4 to raise his average to .402. The
Cubs will sweep the next three games from Boston, and Holmes will go 5 for 14.

1946
St. Louis pitcher Ken Burkhart rolls to a 16-0 shutout over the Reds, after
the Cardinals score 10 runs in the 4th inning. Burkhart allows 10 hits but
strands 14. Enos Slaughter has 6 RBIs.

the twenty-two-year-old will become the first black to play in the American
League.

1948
Dick Lane, CF of Muskegon (Central League), hits 5 HRs in a game against Fort
Wayne. Lane, who will get a trial with the White Sox in 1949, will hit only
7 other HRs during the year, only 18 in a 4-year minor league career, and
not 1 in the ML. Lane will have a cup of coffee with the White Sox next year.

1949
Giants P Monte Kennedy hits a 7th inning grand slam and shuts out the Dodgers,
16-0. It will be 51 years before another Giants hurler (Shawn Estes - 2000)
hits a bases-full homerun. The Giants amass 20 hits, batting around in the
1st and 7th. John Mize and Willard Marshall each have four hits as every
starter collects at least a hit. Ralph Branca (10-2) exits early but takes
the loss. It is a club record for the biggest shutout win that will stand
until May of 2000.

Ralph Kiner's 21st homer, off Warren Hacker, helps the Pirates down the
host Cubs, 7-3. Vic Lombardi goes the rout for his 3rd win.

The Cards move to within a game of the leading Dodgers, by beating the
Reds, 8-1. Gerry Staley pitches the complete game win, and batterymate Joe
Garagiola poles a homer, off starter Herm Wehmeier.

1950
With rookie Joe Collins not hitting and Tommy Henrich still injured,
Casey Stengel asks Joe DiMaggio to play 1B in an experiment. In the 7-2
loss he handles 13 cleanly but is clearly not happy with the move. After
this one-game experiment, Joe returns to the outfield.

1951
Former Dodger pitcher Hugh Casey, 37, kills himself with a shotgun blast
to the neck.

Bill DiBenedetto of the Class D Hornell Dodgers walks 21 in a 5-1 loss to
Corning. This record number of walks breaks the 36-year-old record of Harry
Harper of the Minneapolis Millers.

Giants rookie Willie Mays hits a 13th inning solo homer off the Phillies'
Jocko Thompson to give New York a 9-8 win. It is Willie's 2nd extra inning
homer in two weeks ... he'll hit another on July 7th, against the Braves'
George Estock.

1952
The Giants beat the Dodgers for the 6th time in a row, tipping Brooklyn
4-3. Don Mueller drives in two runs off Billy Loes with a triple, then scores,
and his throw in the 8th nips the tying run. The Dodgers outhit the Giants,
8-4, but Jim Hearn, with relief from Wilhelm, gets the win.

The White Sox take two from the Browns, 6-3 and 12-3, to gain 2nd place in
the AL. The first game, a completion, of an April 27 game takes 4 innings,
with Chuck Stobbs emerging the winner. Stobbs gets a save in the nitecap,
taking over for Marv Grissom. Eddie Robinson knocks in 7 runs in the pair,
including two 3-run homers in the nitecap.

At Brunswick (Georgia-Florida League), Cordele beats Brunswick, 14-2. In the
4th inning, Ralph "Froggy" Betcher of Cordele bats with the bases loaded. A
wild pitch and 2 of the Pirates 6 errors on the day empty the bases. Betcher
then hits his first and only homerun of the season.

1954
With Doby hitting a homer in each game to lead the offense, Bob Feller and
Early Wynn hurl the Indians to a sweep of the White Sox, 3-2 and 5-4. The
Sox pennant hopes receive a jolt when 3B George Kell wrenches his knee and
will be out for 5 weeks.

At the Stadium, Mickey Mantle's opposite field three-run homer is the
game-winner as the Yankees beat Bob Porterfield and the Senators, 3-2. Mantle
has a 12-game hitting streak and is hitting .320.

1957
At Yankee Stadium, the Yankees win a 10-0 laugher over the Red Sox, as Yogi
Berra drives in eight runs. Yogi has a homer and two singles; the second
single is his 1,000th hit.

1958
At Griffith Stadium, Mantle homers twice off Russ Kemmerer to lead New York
to an 11-3 veto of the Senators. The first clears the 31-foot high wall
over the 372-foot marker in right CF and is still rising when it leaves
the ball park. Whitey Ford coasts to his 12th straight win.

1959
Boston fires manager Pinky Higgins, replacing him tomorrow with Billy
Jurges. Coach Rudy York takes over for today's game.

After giving up a grand slam to the A's Bob Cerv, Herb Score settles down
and strikes out 14 in Cleveland's 8-4 win.

1960
Before 50,556 fans in New York, the Yankees sweep two from the Tigers,
winning 7-6 and 6-2. In the opener, Ryne Duran fans Charlie Maxwell with the
bases loaded and 2 outs in the 9th. Detroit is ahead 2-1 in the night cap
when Norm Cash argues at length about a call at first base, and finally gets
tossed. When play resumes, Pete Burnside serves up a 3-run homer to Mantle,
batting righty. The Yankees are 23-5 since June 5 and lead the AL by 3 games.

A day after his wedding in Chicago, Jim O'Toole pitches and loses, as the
Cubs pound him for 7 runs and 9 hits in less than 5 innings. Chicago wins,
7-5. An unsympathetic manager Hutchinson says, "It was his turn to pitch. I
didn't tell him to get married."

1962
The Yankees need all of the 5 homeruns they hit - 2 each by Mantle and Maris,
plus one by Bobby Richardson - to edge the A's 8-7. Mantle's 2nd homer,
in the 8th, is the tie breaker.

1963
At Houston, the Reds' John Tsitouris allows just 2 hits in beating Houston,
2-1. Cincy collects just 2 hits in the win, scoring the first run on Johnny
Edwards homer and the 2nd when Rusty Staub misses a pickoff throw from Hal
Woodeshick and Pete Rose scores from 1B.

In a split with the Orioles, Minnesota SS Zoilo Versalles ties an AL mark
by making 5 errors. The Twins win 7-5, then lose 4-3.

1964
Birdie Tebbetts returns to limited duty as manager of the Indians.

1965
Pre-game horseplay between Phillies teammates Frank Thomas and Richie Allen
turns serious when Thomas swings a bat at Allen. Allen recovers enough
to hit a 3-run triple in the 7th and Thomas hits a pinch homer to tie the
game in the 8th inning. But the Reds prevail 10-8. Following the game, the
Phils release Thomas, who has had a history of irritating players before
the incident with Allen, and he signs with Houston.

1966
Pitcher Tony Cloninger hits 2 grand slams and drives in 9 runs, as the Braves
rout the Giants at Candlestick Park 17-3. Cloninger is the first NL player
to slam two in a game, and the first pitcher ever, and his 9 RBIs are a ML
record for pitchers, breaking Vic Raschi's mark of 7. The National League
record for pitchers was 5, held by several ... the last hurler to collect
5 RBIs in a game is Cloninger who had 5 on June 16th against the Mets
(as noted by Tom Zocco).

Mantle hits a first-inning homer, and for the 2nd time this week has hit
three homeruns in consecutive times at-bat. New York blows a 5-0 lead in
the 8th as the Senators storm back. Bobby Richardson homers in the 11th to
give New York a 6-5 lead. In the bottom of the inning, Paul Casanova is on
first when a sac bunt moves him to 2B. He overruns the bag and decides to
head to 3B where he knocks the ball away from Tom Tresh. He then continues
to home where he is thrown out by a mile.

1967
At the launching pad in Atlanta, Billy Williams, Ron Santo and Randy Hundley
homer for Chicago, and Rico Carty and Felipe Alou answer for the Braves -
all in the first inning, tying a major league record for homers by 2 teams
in an inning. It is the first time its been done in the opening frame. Carty
adds another homer later, but Glenn Beckert's three-run shot helps put the
game out of reach. Ray Culp emerges the winner, 12-6.

In St. Louis the fans get boxing with their baseball in the Cards' 7-3
win over the Reds. After Bob Gibson pitched inside to Tony Perez in the
5th inning, the pair exchange words after Perez flies out. Both benches
empty but there is no fighting until the Reds bullpen, led by Bob Lee,
show up. It takes 12 minutes before the police are needed to restore order.

1968
Luis Tiant registers 19 K's in 10 innings, as Cleveland beats Minnesota, 1-0,
at Cleveland Stadium. Tiant sets two modern ML records - most strikeouts
in a 10-inning game; 32 strikeouts in consecutive games - and ties the
modern ML record of 41 strikeouts in 3 successive appearances. 'El Tiante'
becomes the second hurler to whiff more than 18 batters in an American
League contest - only Tom Cheney of the Senators recorded more with 21
punch outs in a 16-inning game in 1962. He will top the AL in ERA with 1.60.

1969
At Los Angeles, Lee May hits a 2-run homer in the 11th and the Reds beat
the Dodgers, 4-3. For May, second in the NL to McCovey (27) in dingers, it
is his 23rd homer, matching his birth date and uniform number (his younger
brother Carlos will also have his birth date as his uniform number). Granger,
the 3rd Reds pitcher in the 11th, stops the Dodgers rally.

1970
In pregame ceremonies, California's Clyde Wright is inducted into the National
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Hall of Fame for his pitching
while at Carson-Newman College. He then hurls a no-hitter against Oakland
in one hour 51 minutes needing to throw only 98 pitches, winning 4-0. Reggie
Jackson's 400-foot shot to dead center in the 7th is caught.

Mike Lum hits 3 homers as the Braves beat the Padres, 8-1, in the first
game of a doubleheader. The Braves continue hitting in game 2 to win, 9-4.

In Boston, a Yaz homer in game one and an unearned run in the nitecap
provide the Red Sox with 2-1 and 5-4 wins over Cleveland. In game 2,
Indians reliever Dean Chance is told to remove a tiny flag pin on his cap
by umpire Ed Runge in compliance with a rule prohibiting glass buttons and
metal objects on uniforms because of their glare.

1973
Brothers Gaylord (Indians) and Jim (Tigers) Perry pitch against each other
for the only time in their careers. Neither finishes the game, but Gaylord

saves Tommy John's 4-1 win over the Reds in the first game of a doubleheader.

1975

East. But Milwaukee will fall flat in August and slide to a 5th place finish.

1976
The Tigers rookie sensation Mark Fidrych shuts out the Orioles, 4-0, for
his 8th straight victory.

1977
On his 24th birthday, Angel Frank Tanana records his 14th straight complete
game in beating the A's, 6-4, and raising his record to 12-5. His overworked
arm would plague him for the rest of the season, and he would wind up 15-9.

Ron Guidry scatters 6 hits and tosses his 2nd consecutive shutout, a 2-0
Yankee win over Detroit. Roy White breaks the scoreless game with a double
in the 8th inning.

In an 11-7 win over the Padres, Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt hits an
inside-the-park homer, the 2nd of his career. He'll hit one more, in 1982.

1978
At Fenway, Carl Yastrzemski strokes a run-scoring double in the 3rd, his
2,800th career hit, as the Sox pummel the Yankees, 9-5. Yaz adds two singles
in Boston's 12-hit attack, as Dennis Eckersley (9-2) tops Ed Figueroa. The
win moves Boston ahead of 2nd place Milwaukee by 7 1/2 games with New York
now trailing by 8 games.

1980
The ML's largest crowd in 7 years (73,096) watches Wayne Garland 2-hit the
Yankees, 7-0, at Cleveland Stadium.

win over Texas. Doug Flynn will match it also in a month.

Danny Thomas, 29, hangs himself in jail in Mobile while awaiting trial on
charges of raping a 12-year-old. Thomas, who played with the Brewers in

World Wide Church of God and would not play on Friday nights nor Saturday
afternoons.

1982
A County Stadium-record crowd of 55,716 watches the Brewers shut out the

including 2 doubles in the 15th. Dave Beard is the loser for Oakland,
while Odell Jones is the victor.

1987
On 'Dick Howser Day' at Royals Stadium, Paul Splittorff, the team's all-time
leader in victories, is inducted into the Royals' Hall of Fame, along with
