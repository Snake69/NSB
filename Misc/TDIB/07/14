1901
The White Sox top Milwaukee, 4-0, and are prevented from further scoring by
a bases loaded triple play when umpire Joe Cantillon rules that Dummy Hoy
left 3B before a catch. 1B Jiggs Donahue, catches a line drive to retire the
Sox, Frank Isbell, then steps on first to double up runner Sam Mertes. Jiggs
throws to second baseman Billy Gilbert in an effort to nail Fielder Jones,
but Jones was on the base. Meanwhile, Hoy crosses the plate. Gilbert throws
to the 3B Bill Friel, who touches the bag, and Cantillon's rules that Hoy
is out for leaving third base early on the line drive.

1902
At Philadelphia, Highball Wilson, who pitched a game for Cleveland in 1899,

innings. Cy Young is the losing pitcher.

1904
The St. Louis Browns trade Frank Huelsman and Hunter Hill to the Senators

on June 16th.

1905
With runners on 1B and 3B and no outs in the 9th, Boston's Ed Abbaticchio
lines to SS Corcoran in a game-ending triple play against the Reds' Bob
Ewing. The play preserves the Reds' 4-3 win and is the 2nd triple play in
a Reds-Boston game in a week. The other Reds game-ending TP was on June
22, 1882; the next won't come until May 30, 1967. In the 6th Fred Odwell,
who will lead the NL in homeruns, hits a homer over the RF wall, one of
the longest blows hit at South End Grounds.

1906
At Robison Field, the Giants clip the Cardinals, 5-1 and 4-0, with the help
of two additions to the lineup. Cy Seymour, last year's near triple crown
winner, is a new addition from the Reds for $12,000. Seymour was with the
Giants from 1896 to 1900 as a pitcher and outfielder, and in 1905 led the NL
in batting, RBIs, slugging percentage and 2nd in homers (8). Cy has 4 hits
for the Giants today. The other addition is Spike Shannon, who moves over
from the Cardinal dugout in exchange for Sam Mertes and Doc Marshall. Spike
has 3 hits and 2 runs in the opener. Mathewson wins the nitecap, shutting
out the Birds on 6 hits.

1910
At Pittsburgh, the Giants blow a 3-0 lead in the 9th when starter Christy
Mathewson tires. Matty gives up three runs, and with the bases loaded,

but New York does worse damage to Larry Cheney and Jimmy Lavender, and wins
12-8. Bob Bescher has a HR, the 1,000th Giant homerun. New York leads the
the NL by 4 1/2 games.

to beat Cleveland, 2-1, at Fenway Park.

1915
White Sox P Red Faber steals 3 bases in the 4th inning against the A's. With
the White Sox leading 4-2 in the 4th and rain threatening, the A's try
to delay the game. Joe Bush purposely hits Faber with a pitch, and Faber,
trying to speed up the game, tries to get thrown out by stealing. Little
effort is made to retire him, and he scores Chicago's 5th run. His "steal"
of home turns out to be the winning run, as rain never materializes, and
Chicago wins 6-4.

1916
Browns hurler Ernie Koob pitches a complete game going all 17-innings of
the scoreless tie. Carl Mays pitches the first 15 innings for the Red Sox
with Dutch Leonard finishing the 0-0 game.

The Cubs whip the visiting Phillies, 6-3. Despite the new policy of Cubs
owner Charles Weeghman to let fans keep foul balls hit into the stands,
the Phils don't go along with it. The Tribune reports that the Quakers
request compensation for 8 balls hit into the stands and not returned during
pre-game batting practice (as noted by Gene Disio).

1920
At Washington, the Senators jolt the White Sox, 6-4, with the help of a
3-run homer in the 5th inning by Sam Rice. For Rice, it is the 1st of 9
homers he will hit at home in his 19 seasons with the Senators, and all of
the round trippers are inside-the-park.

1925
Tiger manager Ty Cobb shows his animosity towards his veteran pitcher Dutch
Leonard by leaving him in for 9 innings against the A's, who pummel him
for 20 hits in a 12-4 win over Detroit. Even Connie Mack's plea to take
Dutch out is ignored by Cobb. At the end of the month the Tigers will sell
Leonard to Vernon (PCL) but he won't report, quitting baseball instead to
grow grapes in California. It will be payback time next year when Leonard
accuses Cobb and Speaker of throwing a game in late 1919.

Al Maderas, of Springfield (Three I league) homers his first four times up
against Quincy.

1928

1930
Brooklyn takes a 12-3 lead over the Pirates after 5 innings, and Dazzy
Vance puts it on auto for the last 4 innings, giving up 12 hits and 7 runs
to win his 10th. Pittsburgh's only hit in the first four innings is a bunt
single by George Grantham. Captain Glenn Wright matches the Pirates by
hitting two homers and two singles to drive in seven runs. Grantham and
Wright will homer in every NL park this season, as 5 NLers do it.

At Comiskey Park, the White Sox outslug the Yankees 10-9 in the opener
before being handcuffed in the nitecap by Bob Shawkey, 7-2. Lou Gehrig
homers in each game, while Babe Ruth, nursing a sore hand, contributes
a two-run single in the opener for his only safety. Ben Chapman adds a
4th-inning homer in the nitecap.

1934
In Detroit, Gehrig's consecutive-game string is extended by having him lead
off and listed in the lineup as shortstop. He singles and leaves the game,
and Red Rolfe pinch runs. But the Tigers win a swatfest, 12-11, to regain
the AL lead. The Tigers bang out an AL record 11 doubles (the 1905 A's had
the record with 10) while the Yanks add 3, while Ruth and Crosetti chip in
with homers. Marberry beats Grimes.

In the first of 2, the Phils score 11 runs in the 2nd inning and coast to
an 18-0 win over the Reds. Snipe Hansen is the winner over Don Brennan. It
is the Phillies' second 18-0 win over the Reds in four years and ties the
team mark for largest margin in a shutout. Philadelphia will sweep today's
doubleheader with a 5-4 victory in the nightcap.

1936
Pitcher Roger Wolff, in his debut with Oklahoma City (Texas League) holds
Galveston hitless and runless for 9 innings but loses on 2 hits in the 10th.

experiment with uniforms designed to be worn during night games. The red,
white and blue shiny satin uniforms are believed to reflect the light during
the evening contests.

Red Sox pitcher Lefty Grove seriously injures his arm fielding a bunt and

The Yankees tie the AL record with only one assist, as Red Ruffing wins,
8-3, over the Tigers.

1940

with ear flaps in The Sporting News. Players express no interest, but next
year Brooklyn will introduce a cap liner, which some batters start to use.

Freddie Fitzsimmons of the Dodgers wins his 200th career game, a 4-hitter
over Pittsburgh. Fat Freddy will win 6 games each from the Pirates and

16 in just 134 innings of work, the best ratio of wins to innings pitched
of any starter in the 20th century.

inside-the-park homerun - the only HR of his career - and the win.

1946
Player-manager Lou Boudreau of Cleveland hits 4 doubles and one HR, but
Ted Williams wallops 3 HRs and drives in 8 runs, as the Boston Red Sox top
the Indians, 11-10. Boudreau's 5 extra base hits is a since-tied ML record
(20th century), but he is the first American Leaguer to hit 5 in a game. The
Kid's homers include a grand slam with the Tribe ahead 5-0, a 3-run homer,
and a game-tying solo shot in the 8th. In the Sox' 2nd-game win, the famous
Boudreau Shift is born. Boudreau shifts all his players, except the 3B and LF,
to the right side of the diamond in an effort to stop Williams. Laughing at
the unusual alignment, the 'Splendid Splinter' doubles in his first at-bat
against the new defense. In his other at-bats Ted grounds out and walks
twice while ignoring the shift and the Red Sox win, 6-4.

The Dodgers lead shrinks to 2 1/2 games following a doubleheader loss to the

teammates Dropo and Williams.

The Waterbury (Colonial League) club has a franchise but no players when the

games at Kingston, NY. Strike issues are several:  the players claim that

first game and return for the second rather than lay over; 6 players claim
that the club reneged on the promise of a pay raise if they were still on
the roster on June 2.

is only Parnell's 3rd win against 2 losses and is the 6th straight loss -
it'll reach 11 - for 2nd-place Chicago. The no-hitter is the first for the
Red Sox since 1923. Parnell will go 4-4 before a torn muscle in his pitching
arm ends his career as the Red Sox' winningest southpaw.

the Mets, 4-2. The Chicago miscues, that include shortstop Andre Rodgers
