will return on the 15th of August.

Cy Young goes all the way as Boston loses to the Highlanders, 15-14. The New
Yorkers had been shut out in their two previous matches in the series. Patsy
Dougherty leads the Boston offense by hitting for the cycle, but Cy gets
little defense as Boston makes 8 errors behind him. New York starter Jack

and Matty holds on to win.

1908

the A's, 5-4. During the off season, a frustrated Connie Mack traded his

10-year career the .284-hitting Patsy has ruined a no-hitter.

The A's Jack Coombs shuts out the Senators, 4-0, for his 10th win in July,
tying the post-1993 ML record set by Rube Waddell in 1902 for most wins in
a month (as noted by Brian Rash). Nine are complete games and one is a win
in relief on July 11.

1911
At Boston's Huntington Ave Baseball Grounds, Joe Wood of the Red Sox whiffs
twelve Browns enroute to a 5-0 no-hitter. He walks 2 and hits one batter.

St. Louis. The Giants pitcher will beat the Redbirds again on the 31st,
allowing 5 hits. With nine stolen bases, the Giants establish a franchise
record. Eight different New York players contribute to the record and seven
of the nine steals are off Cardinals backstop Jack Bliss.

1912
For the first time, a NL team loses a game because of the rule that holds
runners in place when a batted ball hits an umpire. A double by the Giants'
Buck Herzog drives in 2 runs, but the ball hits umpire Garner Bush, and
the runs do not count. New York loses, 4-3, to the Cubs.

1915
At 41, Honus Wagner becomes the oldest player in this century to hit a grand
slam when he connects in Pittsburgh in the drizzling rain. It is inside
the park against Jeff Pfeffer of Brooklyn in an 8-2 win. The record will
stand until Tony Perez hits a grand slam on May 13, 1985, one day short of
his 43rd birthday. Pfeffer is also caught off 1B when RF Hinchman nabs a
Myer's line drive and makes an unassisted DP.

Walter Johnson wins his own game with a 10th-inning drive to deep CF with

umpire Corcoran. The run-in will also cause the postponement Saturday of
"George Stovall Day" celebrations.

Boston NL pitcher Pat Ragan wins 2 games today, beating the Reds twice,
10-5 and 7-6. In game 1 he is lifted after 4 innings with a lead, but is
given credit for the victory. He goes the distance in the 2nd game.

1916
Pitching for the 7th place Browns, Dave Davenport throws two complete-game
wins over the first-place Yankees, winning 3-1 and 3-2 over Ray Caldwell and
Reb Russell. This singular effort will not be matched against the Yankees,
though Boston's Don McMahon will beat them twice in relief. The Red Sox,
losers of two to the Tigers today, remain in 2nd place a half-game behind
New York.

1918
Back in the rotation, Babe Ruth tops the Browns, 3-2, for the first place
Red Sox, allowing just 4 hits. Ruth has a triple and one RBI at the plate.

Yankees for pitchers Bob McGraw, Allan Russell, an unnamed third player to
be chosen and a reported $20,000 (the New York Times lists $40,000).

The Yankees chase White Sox ace Eddie Cicotte with 12 hits in 5 innings and
roll to a 10-0 win. Hank Thormahlen allows 6 hits in the white wash. Frank
Baker has 4 hits, including 2 doubles and a triple, and Roger Peckinpaugh
adds 3 hits.

In the 9th inning with two out, Detroit P Dutch Leonard walks Braggo Roth
to pitch to Babe Ruth, who already has hit 2 doubles off him. The two had
had an argument in early June at Fenway. The Babe then hits his 9th homer
of the month and his 16th of the year, a new AL record. Despite the homer,
Detroit tops the Red Sox, 10-8.

1920

by the Phillies for lackadaisical play. McGraw gives up 3 bench warmers
and $30,000. The Giants take 3 from the Reds and go into the NL lead for
the first time. They will fall back by 7 games before coming on with a rush
in September.

1922
At the Polo Grounds, the under-performing Pirates crack 5 homers and
trounce the league-leading Giants, 8-3. Max Carey hits two and starter

1924
Art Nehf does it all, pitching the Giants to a 5-2 win over the Cardinals

called a major league record, but still lose to the Tigers, 4-3.

1928
The Indians score 8 in the first and 9 in the 2nd in a 24-6 romp over the
Yankees at Cleveland. George Pipgras takes a quick loss, allowing 5 hits
and getting no outs in the first. Johnny Hodapp of the Indians becomes
the first AL player to get 2 hits in an inning twice in a game when he
strokes a pair of singles in both the 2nd and 6th innings. Hodapp and Joe
Sewell each have 5 of the Tribes' 27 hits as Joe Shaute coasts home with the
win. The 24 runs is the most ever scored against the Yankees. The Yankees'
lead shrinks from 11 1/2 games to 6 in one week.

1929
The lively ball is threatening the popularity of the National pastime in
the opinion of the majority of major and minor league baseball managers
and officials polled by the United News (as noted in the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette). Ten major league managers favor a return to the dead ball, four
like the present ball, one doesn't care what kind of ball is used, and
another failed to express an opinion. John P. McGraw and Wilbert Robinson
are the leaders of the group who would return to the dead ball. Miller
Huggins steadfastly sticks by the lively ball, but admits it might aid the
game to help the pitcher. "We've got to play this game the ways the fans
want it played," Huggins said. "They build the stadiums and they pay the
Ruths and Gehrigs. And they like the home runs." President E.B. Barnard
of the American League thinks the lively ball is being exaggerated as a
menace to baseball, while President John Heydler of the National League
maintains that there is no difference in the baseballs used in the senior
circuit during the past 10 years.

1930
Despite a Hack Wilson HR, Eppa Rixey pitches the visiting Reds to a 4-3 win
over the Cubs. Sheriff Blake takes the loss. The hot-hitting Hack will add

walks plus three hits off Guy Cantrell gives the Indians 7 runs in the 2nd
inning. In the inning, Earl Averill hits his 10th homer and a double. Reliever
Milt Shoffner pitches 7 1/3 innings for the win.

Ruth contributes a pair of singles and a walk, but Gehrig supplies the big
blows in New York's 12-3 win over the host A's. After Ruth opens the 4th
with a single, Gehrig hits his 30th homer into left-center field. In the
5th, Babe walks and Gehrig triples to center; a Ruth single in the 7th is
followed by a Gehrig smash over the RF wall. Lou adds a double in the 2nd
and his 6 RBIs make it easy for Henry Johnson to pick up the win. Gehrig's
hitting moves him into the AL lead at .390, as Al Simmons (.386) is hitless.

1931
Cleveland's Wes Ferrell shuts out Washington, 6-0, scattering 10 hits,
as the Senators leave a record tying 15 runners on base. It's only been
done once before, on May 22, 1913, but it will eventually be matched and,
in 1994, finally topped.

1933

edge the host White Sox, 3-2, scoring two unearned runs on errors by Luke

in response to a Bob Elson question concerning his off-season employment as
a Dayton, Ohio policeman, quips "I crack n*****s on the head". Commissioner

comments as acting "not intentionally, but carelessly," and will suspend
the reserve flychaser for ten days.

1940
The Pirates use 21 players and rally for 6 runs in the 9th, but still lose
to Brooklyn, 7-6.

1942

Bartell and Babe Young homer in the nitecap, a 3-1 win for Dick Lohrman.

Outhit by the Cards 9 to 6, the Dodgers win 4-3 behind Whit Wyatt at Ebbets
Field. Mort Cooper is the loser, dropping the Cards eight games behind the

stopped because of the Army's dim-out rule. There is one out in the home
half of the 7th when the game is stopped.

as the Browns lose, 11-10, to the Senators. The Nats collect 20 hits off
6 Brownie pitchers.

1943

released by the Braves. Cooch will just miss winning the batting title in

to finish one behind former Indian Wes Ferrell on the homer list for pitchers.

1948
In Boston, Big Bill Voiselle pitches the first-place Braves to a 2-1 win
over the Pirates, and collects his 5th hit of the year. Voiselle raises his
average to .097 average, a point higher than his uniform number. Voiselle
has the highest uniform number ever in the majors in honor of his North
Carolina home town of Ninety Six.

Dave Koslo. Jansen and Hartung threw the other two shutouts. Walker Cooper's
grand slam, off Ken Raffensberger, is the big blow.

The Red Sox rout the Tigers, 8-1, behind Jack Kramer's 10th straight

pace the attack. The victory extends the Red Sox AL-lead to a half-game
over the idle A's.

Maglie. New York takes the nitecap as well, 6-4, as Irvin (2) and Mays both
swipe bases.

Against the visiting Phillies, Cubs player-manager Phil Cavarretta earns his
money by driving home 3 runs in a first game win, 5-4, snapping the Cubs'
10-game home losing streak. His triple in the 6th off Robin Roberts ends the
Cubs' scoreless inning skein of 31 innings, and the consecutive scoreless
innings by Phils pitchers at 41. Cavarretta takes the bench in game 2 but
inserts himself as a pinch hitter in the 7th when Roberts relieves, and
hits a pinch grand slam homerun as the Cubs sweep, winning the nitecap,
8-6. The nitecap loss goes to Bubba Church, who put 2 runners on before
giving way to Roberts. It is Church's 1st and only career loss to Chicago
after 8 straight wins.

1952
In Chicago, the first place Yankees, having lost 6 of their last 7 games,
look like they'll lose another as the White Sox build a 7-0 lead through 6
innings behind Billy Pierce. New York scores 3 in the 7th to cut the lead,
then score 3 in the 9th off Harry Dorish. Dorish loads the bases for Mantle,

shuts out the Sox to give New York a 10-6 win.

Sutcliffe swipes home, the first pitcher since Pascual Perez in 1984 to steal

commissioner Bud Selig and union head Donald Fehr urges all sides 'to protect
the game we all love and have given so much to, we suggest you agree to a

franchise history to hit for the cycle. After singling in the second, doubling

free agency at the end of the season.

of run support.

The front-running Padres trade Double-A right-hander Wynn Pelzer to obtain
veteran infielder Miguel Tejada from the Orioles and also include more than

field and at the plate, with his 14 years of experience in the major leagues.

surgery during spring training.

deep beyond the center-field wall in the Indians' 3-2 come-from-behind
