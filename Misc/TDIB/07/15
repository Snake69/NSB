1901
Christy Mathewson becomes the first rookie in the modern era of baseball
history (post 1900) to throw a no-hitter. The 20-year-old right-hander
holds the Cardinals hitless in the Giants' 5-0 victory at Robison Field in
St. Louis. Matty saves his own no-hitter in the 6th when an Otto Krueger
hit caroms off 1B Chick Ganzel's glove to Mathewson, who throws back to 1B
for a 3-1-3 putout.

1902
At Cincinnati, Christy Mathewson starts a triple play in the 2nd inning by

1903
In a showdown game at Pittsburgh, the Giants score 3 runs in the top of
the 9th to take a 3-2 lead, but the Bucs tie it up against Mathewson. No

to give Matty his 6th win of the year over Pittsburgh. Matty strikes out
11 and scatters 10 hits.

McGinnity, is the winner.

1905
In New York, the Giants open a four-game series with the 2nd place Pirates
by staking McGinnity to a 6-0 lead. But the Bucs score 2 in the 6th and
5 runs in the 7th inning before Iron Joe is lifted. Mathewson shuts out
Pittsburgh over the last 2 2/3 innings and New York scores a deuce in the
9th on a 2-run homer by George Browne. Browne is carried off the field by
the ecstatic fans after the 8-7 win. Pittsburgh takes the nitecap, 3-0,
behind Deacon Phillippe's four-hitter. Honus Wagner secures the victory
with a 2-run homer onto the elevated tracks in the 8th inning.

1907
The White Sox pound the Highlanders, 15-0, the second time this season
they've beaten New York by that score. They'll beat them in 1950 by the
same score, the Yanks' team record for most runs by an opponent in a shutout.

and a walk, and Doc Miller has 4 hits and 4 stolen bases.

The Reds swap Fred Beck, last year's co-leader in homers in the NL, to the
Phils, and include Bill Burns with him. The Phils send Bert Humphries to
the Reds. Beck was acquired from the Braves in March, but hit just .184 for
Cincy. He was the second Brave in 4 years to lead the NL in homers and then
get shipped to the Reds in the off-season. The other, Dave Brain, lasted
just 16 games with the Reds in 1908. Beck will have 3 homers this year for
Philadelphia, helping them to be the first ML team with more homers than
triples in a season. Beck will move to the Cubs after the season.

1912
A U.S. team defeats the Swedish Vesteras Club, 13-3, in a one-game Olympic
exhibition in Stockholm, Sweden.

run his streak to 61 innings.

both against New York, as he beats the Yankees, 3-0. Roger Peckinpaugh's

1915
In the first game of a doubleheader with Washington, Brownie rookie
pitcher-first baseman George Sisler goes all the way allowing 6 hits in
winning, 5-2. St. Louis takes the second game, 4-3. Sisler goes 4-4 with
a 2.83 ERA in fifteen starts for the Browns. He will become the Browns'
full-time first baseman in 1916 and will make only 4 more starts on the
mound in his Hall of Fame career.

Braggo Roth each have 4 hits for the Tribe. Umpire Brick Owens confiscates
a ball from Yank pitcher Joe Finneran, who had earlier been accused by
George Moriarty of throwing a tallow ball, and will send the exhibit A to
Ban Johnson. Owens also throws out more than the ball when he tosses Bill
Wambsganss in the first for protesting a strike call and Steve O'Neill in
the 2nd for disagreeing on an out call. Cleveland now moves into 3rd place
ahead of the Yankees.

Slim Sallee, who has been out of action with a lame back, gives up 5 Reds
hits in pitching the Giants to a 2-1 win. Fred Toney takes the loss for Cincy.

the nitecap when Larry Gardner drives in 2 runs in the 5th with a triple.

1920
Babe Ruth ties his 1919 record of 29 HRs with a game-winner in the 11th,
off lefty Bill Burwell, to beat the Browns, 13-10. The Babe's blast is

baseman Jake Daubert's walk-off homer four days earlier is the only other
hit this season. Ruth scores three runs, while Pratt has hits in his first
four at-bats. Wally Pipp homers, but the Browns match it with homeruns by

what they deemed pirated property.

1923
At the Polo Grounds, Cubs outfielder Barney Friberg breaks a 5-5 tie by

1925
The A's go back into the lead with a sweep over the White Sox, 9-7 and 11-5.

The NL owners meet in NYC and take no action on the so-called "rabbit
ball." They concluded that more frequent replacement of balls and better
stitching is the cause of the homeruns. One decision is approved: rosin bags
will be placed behind the mounds. According to Burt Solomon, this practice
started in the Southern Association.

1926
Charlie Gehringer shocks Urban Shocker with his first ML homer, and the
Tigers beat the Yankees, 7-2. Sam Gibson is the winner.

over the two days without an error. Today he has 6 POs and 10 assists.

The Yankees' Lefty Gomez beats the Indians, 8-5, for his 15th win. The
weak-hitting Gomez has 2 hits to knock in 2 runs and New York knocks out
Wes Ferrell in the 4th inning. Ferrell, suffering from his 20+ innings of
work in 3 days, relates to Don Honig years later:  "Now, that was a little
relief stint, those 11 innings. A few days later I'm taking my regular
turn, against the Yankees in New York. I got out there, and I just don't
have anything on the ball. They beat me. I'm sitting in the clubhouse
after the game, and Peckinpaugh comes over and says, 'Hey, why don't you
bear down out there?' 'What the hell are you talking about?' I said. I
was steaming. 'I've been winning 20 games every year for you and pitching
out of turn whenever you needed me, and you ask me why I wasn't bearing
down? I always bear down. I just didn't have anything to bear down with
today.'" Ferrell's relationship with Peckinpaugh will go downhill after
that and result in Ferrell's suspension.

1939
A disputed call on a Harry Craft fly ball down the LF foul line into the
upper deck at the Polo Grounds touches off a melee in which the Giants'
Billy Jurges and umpire George Magerkurth spit at each other. Both will be
fined $150 and suspended for 10 days. NL President Ford Frick announces that
2-foot screens are to be installed inside all foul poles to prevent future
arguments. The AL eventually also adopts the rule. The Giants lose, 8-4,
to the Reds and will add another 8 in a row to take them out of contention.

and former teammate Harry Gumbert, turn a triple play in the 2nd, and coast
to a 12-1 win. Emil Verban, who started the triple play, is the winner. The
Cards also reeled off a triple play on July 1 against the Dodgers, and the

bases-full round-tripper to Sammy White two weeks ago at Fenway Park,

two innings. Nolan's arm stiffens while watching his team rally for 5 runs
in the top of the 8th. With 2 outs in the 9th, Norm Cash, who had struck
out his 3 other times at-bat, comes to bat wielding a piano leg. Umpire Ron

teams collect 34 hits. Treadway, Presley and Justice all homer in the 7th off
Dale Mohoric, but Tim Wallace's grand slam and Galarraga's 3-run HR offset
them. Kremer and Murphy for Atlanta, and Fitzgerald for Montreal also homer.

from Kansas City on April 26 and last pitched June 13.

striking out 11, giving up 5 hits and allowing no runs. Consistent with his
record-setting season, he walks none. He'll end up with more wins than walks,
14 to 13.

In the first inning at Comiskey Park, Sox manager Gene Lamont accuses
Indian slugger Albert Belle of using a corked bat, and umpire Dave Phillips
confiscates the bat and stores it in the ump's dressing room. In a Mission
Impossible caper revealed in 1999, the Indians' Jason Grimsley crawls 100
feet along a ceiling, drops down into the dressing room, and exchanges
Belle's bat for one of Paul Sorrento's. After the 3-2 Indians' win,

Alexander, will manage just a broken bat single in 18 at-bats and after 6
games at 3B, Cal will return to shortstop.

pitchers Hector Carrasco and Scott Service.

outdoors. Under an open retractable roof, Seattle's debut at the $517.6
million Safeco Field becomes forgettable as closer Jose Mesa squanders a
ninth-inning lead by walking four batters resulting in a 3-2 defeat to the
Padres. A crowd of 44,607 is on hand.

The Brewers postpone their game against Kansas City as a gesture of respect
for the three workers who died when a huge crane collapsed lifting a portion
of the roof for the team's new stadium, Miller Park. The crane broke in
half as it lifted the 400-ton load damaging the partially completed stadium.

At the Oakland Coliseum in the fifth inning of an 11-9 win over San Francisco,

balls and should have been charged with a 4th, while Derek Jeter makes a
critical error. Posada will lead the majors in passed balls this year with 18.

Behind Piazza's 3 hits and 3 RBIs, the Mets win, 5-2, over Toronto as both
teams celebrate Negro League Tribute Day by wearing old NL uniforms. The
Mets wear the NY Cubans, 1947 NL champs, while the Blue Jays are in the
uniforms of the Chatham All Stars. In Pittsburgh, the Pirates wear the
Homestead Grays and the Royals wear Monarchs uniforms.

Brian Lawrence pitches a complete game 5-1 win over the Angels, and the
Padres reward him after the game by sending him down to Portland (PCL). The
move is to make room for Brian Tolberg, out since May 6th when he broke a
finger on a comebacker from Sean Casey.

Umpires file a grievance against ML baseball, saying the commissioner's
office is pressuring them to call more strikes by keeping track of total
pitch counts. As part of the ML's efforts, cameras were installed over the
weekend, July 13 and 14, at Shea to track each pitch. Fenway and Shea are
the only parks with the tracking system, which is similar to that used on
Fox' broadcasts, but ML officials hope to have 4 more by September.

a game won by the Quakes by a score of 19-4. Two of his victims reach base
on 3rd-strike wild pitches.

2005
The Royals establish the longest losing streak by any big league franchise
to play in Kansas City. Their 16th consecutive loss, a 11-3 decision to
the Mariners, is one more than the 1884 Unions, the first team to play
professionally in the City of Fountains.

At Miller Park, Mike Stanton's first appearance in a Washington Nationals

base umpire.

slate. The last time such an event occurred was on September 15, 1978.

2007
In front of a sellout crowd of 44,872 at Citizens Bank Park, the 125-year

All-Star game, Rangers shortstop Michael Young's sac fly plates Justin Morneau
of the Twins to end the 4 hour 50 minute marathon. The record tying 15-inning
contest gives the American League its 11th consecutive victory as the Junior
Circuit beats the National League, 4-3. Dan Uggla becomes the first player
in the history of the All-Star game to make three errors. The Marlins second
baseman, who has two miscues in the 10th and one in the 13th, doesn't fare
much better at the plate going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and grounding
into a double play with runners on first and third in the 10th inning.

Lou Gehrig's wool warm-up jacket, given to Marion and Ray Parker in 1941,
friends of the Yankee first baseman and his wife Eleanor, is won with a
$325,000 bid at Hunt Auctions site at the All-Star Fan Fest at the Javits

one he wore to bring out the Yankee lineup card at Detroit's Briggs Stadium
in 1939, on the day his streak of 2,130 consecutive games ended.

2009
The Phillies and Pedro Martinez finalize a one-year deal, reportedly worth

the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder strain, has compiled a 214-99
record during his 17 seasons in the big leagues.

2013
NL manager Bruce Bochy names Matt Harvey as the National League's starter. The
24-year-old rookie right-hander, who becomes the first Mets pitcher to start

sold him to the Halos in May, hits three homeruns his first three at-bats,
helping the team complete a three-game sweep of the Diamondbacks with a 5-3
victory at Citi Field. The outfielder’s first three homers of the season

in a game, but the 27-year-old is the first to accomplish the feat at home.

2017
Cody Bellinger becomes the first Dodger rookie to hit for the cycle when
he collects a seventh-inning triple in the team's 7-1 victory over the
