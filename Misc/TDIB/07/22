1901
At St. Louis, the Colts blow a 5-0 lead and the Cardinals win, 6-5, scoring a
run in the 8th against reliever rube Waddell. Pete Childs, recently acquired
from St. Louis to take over 2B from veteran Cupid Childs, scores the last
Chicago tally after hitting a triple in the 5th.

The A's are victorious in Chicago over the first-place White Sox, winning
2-1 in 12 innings. Eddie Plank wins over Roy Patterson, the St. Croix wonder,
as all 3 runs are the result of errors.

1902
Jack Pfiester beats Doc Scanlan to give Chicago (NL) a 6-3 win over Brooklyn.

The A's Rube Waddell beats Addie Joss and the visiting Clevelanders,
9-4. With 2 outs in the 9th inning, and with two strikes on Harry Bay,
Waddell gestures to the crowd to go home. He then strikes out Bay to end
the game, his 2nd win in 2 games with Cleveland. Rube will end the night
by refereeing the Grif Jones-Jimmy Farren lightweight fight.

1905
Weldon Henley of the Athletics, who will win 4 games all year, fires
a no-hitter against the 7th place St. Louis Browns winning 6-0. During
his four-year big league career, the Georgia native will compile a 32-43
won-loss record. Harry Davis and Lave Cross each have 3 hits off Barney
Pelty. St. Louis cops a split by defeating Rube Waddell, 3-2, in the nitecap.

1906
Without a single assist registered by his Reds' teammates, Bob Ewing beats
the Phillies, 10-3.

1907
In the Giants' 2-1 loss to the Cubs, Larry Doyle debuts at 2B for New
York. The Giants manage just 4 hits off Cubs ace Ed Reulbach, but Doyle
has 2 of them.

1908
In Pittsburgh, Brooklyn first sacker Tim Jordan hits an over-the-fence HR,
the first in 9 years, but its all the scoring his team can muster. The
Pirates prevail, 2-1.

1909
Ty Cobb steals 2B, 3B and home in the 7th inning, doing it against Red Sox
pitcher Harry Wolter. The Tigers beat Boston 6-0, as Ty has 3 hits and 4
steals. Killian is the winning pitcher.

Pitching for Portland (PCL), Alex Carson pitches a 10-inning no-hitter
against LA, winning 1-0. He allows one baserunner, who reaches in the 8th
on an error. Toser is the losing pitcher. It is the first extra-inning
no-hitter in PCL history. National Baseball Commission head Garry Herrmann
is in attendance.

1910
Pittsburgh ace Deacon Phillippe hits a 2nd inning inside-the-park grand slam,
off Brooklyn's Fred Miller, and the visiting Pirates roll, 14-1. Not till
Mel Stottlemyre, in 1965, will another pitcher slam one inside-the-park.

1911
The Pirates pay St. Paul of the American Association $22,500 for righthander
Marty O'Toole, the highest purchase to date. Dreyfuss spends another $5,000
for his batterymate Bill Kelly. In 1912, O'Toole will be 15-17 and lead
the NL with 159 walks. He will last only 2 more years.

Brooklyn hurler Nap Rucker loses a no-hitter with 2 outs in the 9th
inning when Cincinnati's Bob Bescher comes through with a chopper up the
middle. Rucker wins the game, 1-0, outpitching Frank Smith, who gives up 2
hits and an unearned run. The Reds set a ML record for 9 innings by going
to bat just 24 times (it'll be topped in the AL and tied twice in the NL
this century) and the 2 teams combine for just 48 at-bats, to tie a ML
record set April 22, 1910.

A crowd of 28,000 sees Mathewson come back against the Cards to win, 10-2,
as the Giants riddle Bill Steele.

outpitching George Suggs.

to George Moriarty, before striking out Baldy Louden.

The Red Sox sell pitcher Eddie Ciccotte to the White Sox.

1913
In a game against the Superbas (Dodgers), Slim Sallee becomes the only pitcher
in Cardinal history to steal home. In the third inning, the Redbird southpaw
scores the first run in St Louis' 3-1 victory over Brooklyn at Ebbets Field.

New York sweeps two from Pittsburgh, winning 8-3 and 2-1 in 11 innings. Al
Demaree wins the rout in the opener, and former Pirate Art Fromme, in relief
of Mathewson, picks up the victory in the 2nd game. Fred Merkle drives home
George Burns to win for New York. The Giants now lead the NL by 8 games.

1914
Bill James continues the Braves' remarkable pitching by blanking the Pirates,
1-0. The Braves then lose the nitecap, 8-4.

1915
At St. Louis, the Red Sox use 3 pitchers in subduing the Browns, 7-3. With
the Red Sox ahead, Carl Mays takes over in the 2nd with 2 outs and pitches
through the 8th to earn the win. Browns rookie George Sisler pitches in
the 9th inning, allowing a hit to Red Sox reliever Smoky Joe Wood.

Jack Ness of Oakland (Pacific Coast League) has his 49-game hitting streak
stopped by veteran Art Fromme. Ness, now hitting .387, bats .440 in the
longest streak thus far in organized baseball, topping Cobb's streak of 40
games of 1911, and long since breaking Chester Radbourne's PCL record of
29 games.

1917
Before 23,000 in Chicago, the White Sox trim the Red Sox, 2-0. Reb Russell
is the winning pitcher while Swede Risberg is most of the offense. Swede
scores from 3B on a foul pop to the third baseman, sliding into catcher
Agnew and knocking the ball out of his hands. He also knocks him out of
the game. Swede also has a RBI single.

Cleveland rolls over the visiting A's, 20-6. Jim Bagby pitches 6 shutout
innings and then leaves after the Tribe scores 8 runs in the 6th, to take
an 11-0 lead.

1918
With today's game possibly the last of the season, 10,000 fans show up at
Fenway in 98 degree heat. The Red Sox win their 2nd doubleheader shutout
in 5 days, this time over the Tigers. Joe Bush wins the opener, 1-0, and
Carl Mays takes the nitecap 3-0. Ruth goes 0 for 7 in the two games.

The Giants purchase pitcher Fred Toney from the Reds.

1920
The Yanks move to seven percentage points behind the Indians by tripping the
Tribe, 11-3 in 7 innings. The Yanks put it away early and then try and speed
play to beat the rain:  Ruth doubles in the 4th and is out strolling to 3B,
Meusel does the same, and when Bodie follows with a single-turned-double
when Speaker doesn't throw to 2B, the Indians leave Ping alone as he goes to
3B on a passed ball and strolls home to score. With the crowd booing, Ward
walks and then Muddy Ruel waves at three to end the 4th inning. Cleveland
goes down in the 5th, and the two teams play normally until the 7th. Rip
Collins is the winner over Stan Coveleski.

The Red Sox protest the sale of Portsmouth (VA) shortstop Pie Traynor to the
Pirates for $10,000. The Red Sox sent Traynor to Portsmouth on the condition
they would have first choice of any players. The future Hall of Fame third
baseman will play just 24 games for Pittsburgh in the next two seasons,
but then anchor the Pirate infield for a decade.

1921
Despite it being an exhibition game, the Yankees show no mercy, deflating
the Akron Firestones, 23-3.

1922
The Cards go into first place by 1/2 game by beating Boston while the Reds
are downing the Giants. It is the first time both St. Louis teams are ever on
top together. St. Louis overcomes an 8-3 deficit in the 8th, to win, 9-8. The
game was halted to clear hundreds of straw hats off the field. For the Cards,
it is their 23rd win in 29 games, but from here on out they will slide.

1923
Washington's Walter Johnson is the first ML pitcher to notch 3,000 strikeouts
(fanning Stan Coveleski) on the way to 3,508. He fans 5 in beating Cleveland,
3-1. The milestone will not be reached again until Bob Gibson accomplishes
the feat in 1974. The Tribe has to pack, ending their extended 31 game home
stand which began on June 23. Their record for the stay was 16-15. Every
AL team paid a visit during the home stand.

1924
In the first inning of game 1, the Cubs' catcher Bob O'Farrell fractures
his head when hit by a foul tip which strikes his mask driving the top of
it into his skull. He'll be out about a month. The Braves take the opener,
3-1, then lose the nitecap by the same score.

The Yankees buy SS Leo Durocher from Hartford (Eastern League).

1926
The Reds pound 4 triples in an 11-run 2nd inning, including 2 by Curt Walker,
against the Braves, tying a ML record, and go on to win, 13-3. Walker's feat,
the 1st since 1900, won't be done again until Al Zarilla does it in the AL
in 1946. On the 24th, the Pirates move past the Reds into the NL lead.

The Giants score two runs in the 9th inning off Pete Alexander to whip the
Cardinals, 5-3.

1927
Red Lucas of the Reds pitches a 3-0 one-hitter against Dazzy Vance and
the Dodgers. The "hit" is a 6th-inning grounder by Hank DeBerry that goes
between the legs of Cincinnati 2B Hughie Critz.

1928
P Red Faber of the White Sox comes up to bat in the 8th with 2 runners on
base and the game with the Yankees tied 4-4. He swings twice righthanded
against righty Wilcy Moore and misses. He then switches to the left side
and knocks in the winning runs with a single to center as the Sox win,
6-4. Cy Moore is the loser in relief.

1929
After losing, 7-3, to Rube Walberg, the Yankees capture a hair-raising
14-inning win, 4-3. George Pipgras matches the vet Jack Quinn, allowing
just 4 hits the whole game. His wildness allows the Athletics to score 3
in the 1st, when Al Simmons belts a homer. For the 14 innings, the A's set
a record by leaving no runners on base.

1930
Phillies pitcher Phil Collins hits homeruns in the 4th and 5th innings of an
11-5 win over the Pirates. His two HRs is half of his career total. Teammate
Pinky Whitney adds an inside-the-park homer in the 6th.

Behind Ed Coffman, the Browns outpoll the Senators, 3-1, for their 3rd win
in a row over Washington. The Browns are the only team to have won more
than they've lost against the 2nd place Nats so far this year.

Good-hitting pitcher George Uhle bangs a 2-run pinch single in the 8th to
give the Tigers a 6-5 win over the first place A's. Reliever Lefty Grove takes
the loss, his 4th of the year, while Chief Hogsett is the Bengal victor. The
two teams combine for 10 doubles, with Hayworth and McManus collecting a pair.

The Indians trip the Yankees twice, winning 6-5 and 10-8. Cleveland wins the
opener for Willis Hudlin by scoring a pair in the bottom of the 9th. The
Yanks tie the nitecap at 8-8 when Ben Chapman scores on the front end of
a double steal. Earl Averill breaks the tie with a two-run homer, his 2nd
of the game, and his 2nd over the right field screen.

1931
In Detroit, the Tigers win 3-2 over the Yankees in game 1. In game 2, Ruth
homers in the 1st off Tommy Bridges, then he and Gehrig both homer in the
6th off Charles Sullivan as New York wins, 9-5. Lazzeri triples with the
sacks full to help Babe and Lou.

1932
In Pittsburgh, Billy Jurges, shot on July 6, returns to the Cubs lineup,
allowing Woody English to move back to 3B. But Pittsburgh's Steve Swetonic
tops Pat Malone, 3-1, for the win. Pittsburgh now leads the Cubs by 3
1/2 games.

In the AL's only game, the A's easily defeat the Senators, 8-4, as Mickey
Cochrane hits for the cycle, scoring 3 and driving home 4. Walberg is touched
for 15 hits, but Washington helps with poor baserunning. They have 4 singles
and no runs in the 8th.

1933
The Indians' Monte Pearson scatters eight hits in edging the Yankees,
2-1. Again, Ben Chapman drives in Ruth with the lone run.

and notches his 2,000th strikeout to beat the Braves, 4-2, for the Cardinals.

1935
The Red Sox end a game for the second consecutive day with Wes Ferrell

him a 2-1 victory against the Browns.

1936
In a 16-4 cakewalk over the Pirates, Phillies OF Johnny Moore hits 3
straight HRs.

1938

first appearance in the majors since chucking for the Giants in 1922-23. The
long-time minor leaguer gives up 5 hits and 3 runs in 2 2/3 innings to finish
a 9-7 Browns win over Washington. Cactus will go 3-7 this year for the Browns.

1937
The Phils jump on Clyde Shoun and Larry French for 7 runs in the 8th and
top the league-leading Cubs, 7-4. Claude Passeau is the winner.

tomorrow. Goodman has three hits, including a homer for the Reds, while
Burgess Whitehead collects 3 hits for New York.

Behind Danny MacFayden, the Bees stop the Cards, 3-0, to sweep the four-game

and the team's 7th of the game, jumps from the stands to punch the Boston
catcher. Pittsburgh wins, 9-3.

Detroit pitcher Schoolboy Rowe helps his own cause by bashing a 2nd-inning

get one hit in seven at-bats (.143) this season.

In the 2nd inning, with one out and 1B open, the Cards intentionally walk
the Giants' Dick Bartell to get to Billy Jurges. The hot Jurges, with

1948
The Yankees take the rubber game of the series with the Indians as Vic Raschi
earns the decision over Bob Feller, 6-5. Joe DiMaggio's grand slam is the
big blow for the Bombers:  he has hit 4 homers and a triple in Feller's
4 starts against New York. His 8 RBIs in the 3 games with Cleveland gives
him a league-leading 82.

Denny Galehouse returns to the Red Sox lineup and stops Chicago, 3-0. Vern
Stephens clouts a 2-run homer. In the 2nd game, a 5-3 win, Stephens adds
