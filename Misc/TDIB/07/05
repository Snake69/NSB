(three doubles and three singles). Demaree manages another 2 hits in the
nitecap. The two games last 6 1/2 hours. The Cubs now lead the Giants by
2 games.

The Indians pound on the Browns like a drum, winning 14-4 and 5-4. In
the opener Cleveland's Hal Trosky drives in 7 runs on three successive
homers (the first baseman from Norway, Iowa will finish the season with 32
round-trippers), the first two off former teammate Oral Hildebrand. Sheriff

1946
The first place Dodgers lose to the last-place Giants, 7-6, but not before
Bums manager Durocher makes his famous, "nice guys finish last" remark to
reporters. In a pre-game interview with Red Barber, the announcer calls
Giants manager Ott "a nice guy." The Lip retorts, "A nice guy? I've been
in baseball a long time. Do you know a nicer guy in the world than Mel
Ott? He's a nice guy. In last place. Where am I? In first place. The nice
guys are over there in last place, not in this dugout."

for 13 years amassing 1,515 hits, just three less than Jackie Robinson.

homer and a single to pace the Yankees to a 12-8 win over the Athletics. Tommy

(he walks 2 in the 6th). He also hits 4 batters to tie the ML record. Kellner

tears ligaments in his left knee in a collision with Mapes at 2B in the 7th.

1951

to an 8-4 win over the Giants. Andy Pafko also homers, off Larry Jansen. Don
Newcombe notches his 12th win, giving up 7 hits. After sweeping the Giants
in the 3-game series, Dodger manager Chuck Dressen declares, "We knocked
'em out. They won't bother us anymore." The Dodgers now lead the Giants by
7 1/2 games.

1952
In their final season in Boston, the Braves play in front of the largest
home crowd of the season when 13,405 fans watch Brooklyn beat their team for
the 12th consecutive time, a 5-3 complete-game victory by Carl Erskine. The

a 3-run homer in the 2nd, and Bobby Thomson legs out an inside-the-park
homer. Spencer's homer in the 7th, his team-high 14th, completes the scoring,

and will get fines of $100. Sarni gets a $25 slap. The Redlegs tally twice
in the 9th to win, 5-4.

1956

hits, including a Rosen 3-run homer in the 6th.

1958
At Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox take a 5-3 lead in the top of the 11th, only
to watch the Yankees stall in their at-bats until the 11:59 P.M. curfew is
reached. The outcome then reverts to the 10th inning 3-3 tie. Mantle has
a game-tying homer in the 9th, off Dave Sisler.

infielder's offensive output helps the Redbirds rout the Dodgers, 9-1.

At Yankee Stadium, Roger Maris cracks a 7th inning solo HR against the
Indians, and also is credited - erroneously, as it turns out - with a
3rd-inning RBI on a single. The 2 RBIs are officially recorded, though just

for the season.

wins his 14th straight game 9-3 at Detroit. Detroit OF Mickey Stanley plays
his 220th straight errorless game and C Bill Freehan picks Paul Blair off

who select him in January of 1982 but he will be ineffective in the minors.

1980

with a 6-run first inning. Mario Soto relieves and pitches 8 2/3 innings
of shutout ball, allowing just 3 hits. The Reds rally to win, 8-6.

of the frame to win the Three Rivers Stadium contest, 5-4.

order are Billy Hatcher, Davey Lopes and Ryne Sandberg. After Hatcher

and singles. Lopes, hitting in his proper turn, doubles Sandberg home. All
for naught as the Giants beat them, 12-6.

1987

inning. Chicago gets homers from Kal Daniels, Dawson, Sandberg and Grace.

1993
Oakland OF Rickey Henderson leads off both games of the A's doubleheader
against the Indians with HRs. It is the 1st time this has happened since
