1901
The Boston Nationals rap out 15 hits in 12 innings against Pittsburgh, but
fail to score. The Pirates finally push over a run to win 1-0. Boston sets
a ML record for most hits and no runs in an extra inning game. They'll tie
the record against the same Pirates in 1918.

Harry Davis hits for the cycle to lead the A's to a 13-6 victory over Boston.

At a secret meeting, the NL Board of directors votes to abrogate the National
Agreement that has governed organized baseball, effective September 30.

Wicker, the ex-Cub, holds New York in check for a 5-3 Cincy win.

1908
At Pittsburgh, the Giants (43-30) take a 4-0 lead, but the Pirates claw
back on back-to-back triples by Wagner and Clarke. Tommy Leach wins it for
the Bucs with a 9th inning homerun to deep center.

The Red Sox purchase 1B Jake Stahl from the Highlanders.

1911
When umpire Bill Klem stops the Phillies-Cardinal game to have an unruly
fan removed from the Baker Bowl, it is believed to be the first time a
patron has been escorted from a ballpark. The common practice at the time
was to use bodyguards after the contest to protect the arbitrators rather
than risk the crowd's ire by ousting one of their own.

Sherry Magee, star OF for the Phillies, knocks out umpire Bill Finneran with
one punch after being ejected for disputing a called 3rd strike. He is fined
$200 and suspended for the season, but upon appeal he will be reinstated
after 5 weeks and 29 games missed. The Phils win, 4-2, behind Alexander,
who strikes out 9.

At the Polo Grounds, Chicago scores unearned runs in 3 innings to beat
Mathewson, 3-2, in 10 innings.

1912
Cy Young comes out of retirement for the day to play first base for the
Canton (Central League) club on boosters day. He goes hitless and handles
6 chances in the 4-3 win over Youngstown. Young pitched his first game in
Organized Ball for Canton on April 30, 1890.

1913
Led by Ward Miller's 2-run triple, the Cubs stop the Giants, 3-2. The victory
ends the New Yorkers' win streak at 14 games and stops Christy Mathewson's
win streak at 9 victories. Matty's skein of consecutive innings without a
pass continues however, and is at 52.

1914
Detroit's Billy Purtell and Marty Kavanagh combine to nab Eddie Collins
with the hidden ball trick. It comes in the 9th inning and helps preserve
an 8-8 tie with Philadelphia.

1916
For the 2nd time this season, White Sox pitchers toss shutouts in a
doubleheader, this time against the Red Sox. Lefty Williams wins 4-0, then
Reb Russell follows with a 3-0 victory. With the temperature at Fenway in
the 90s, this is the first of three consecutive doubleheaders for the two Sox.

1917
Coming off a suspension Yankees righthander Ray Caldwell pitches 9 2/3
innings of scoreless relief, picking up a 7-5 win over the Browns in 17
innings. He celebrates after the game by stealing a ring worth $150 from
the home of Mrs. Lucy Dick when he was visiting. He is arrested for larceny.

1918
Reds pitchers Jimmy Ring and Mike Regan combine to whitewash the Robins,
winning 7-0 and 5-0. Brooklyn manages 6 hits in the opener, and two in
second game. Lee Magee and Edd Roush combine for 6 hits and 4 runs off
Burleigh Grimes in game 2.

The Red Sox beat the Indians, 2-0, in 5 innings, winning their 4th game
in the series with Cleveland. Ruth's triple in the 4th scores the first
run, the 3rd time in the series that Ruth has driven in the winner with a
triple. The game is called after 5 innings because of rain.

1919
The White Sox move into first place with a 9-2 win over the A's. Williams
is the winner.

1920
Tris Speaker doubles his first time up, then is stopped after banging
out 11 straight hits to top the AL record 10 straight, set by Lajoie in
1901. It's the record until Pinky Higgins of the Red Sox racks up 12 in
a row in 1938. Speaker has five hits for the day and is now hitting over
.400. The Indians split today's Sunday doubleheader, winning the opener 7-2,
with Stan Coveleski beating Bill Snyder. Washington takes the nitecap, 2-1,
behind Jim Shaw.

Red Faber stops the A's on five hits to shut out Philley, 6-0. Joe Jackson
leads the sixteen hit White Sox attack with four hits.

Behind George Kelly's six RBIs, the Giants top the Cubs, 8-5. Kelly has a
bases loaded triple in the first inning, a two run single in the 2nd and
a solo homer in the 4th to complete his efforts.

1921
The Indians tally 10 runs to give Duster Mails an easy 10-0 win in the
opener against the A's. Mails allows 12 hits in the shutout, 2 off the
record. Cleveland scores just one run for Guy Morton, but he makes it stand
up in a 1-0 nitecap win.

1922
The Giants unleash a 28-hit attack in game 1, to squash the Pirates, 19-2. P
Art Nehf has three hits as does his batterymate Frank Snyder, who has a
pair of triples, and drives in 5 runs. Frankie Frisch has 4 hits, Irish
Meusel is 4 for 4 with 6 RBIs, and Dave Bancroft has 5 hits. A footnote
in the game is Bucs pinch hitter Art Merewether who goes hitless in his
one ML at-bat. He will later graduate from MIT, the only big leaguer to do
so. Pittsburgh wins game 2, 5-4.

1923
Cardinals rookie P Johnny Stuart hurls 2 complete-game victories over Boston,
winning by scores of 11-1 and 6-3, and striking out narry a batter. He
allows 3 hits in the opener and 10 in the nitecap.

1925
Irish Meusel has three hits and drives in three runs to lead the Giants to
10-3 win over the Cubs. The Giants make 11 hits off John Blake while Virgil
Barnes gives up 8 hits, including Gabby Hartnett's homerun.

In Chicago, Babe Ruth's two run homer, his 8th of the year, is enough as
the Yankees top the White Sox, 5-3, in a game stopped by rain in the 9th
inning. Herb Pennock bags the win over Mike Cvengros.

The Red Sox waive good-bye to veteran P Jack Quinn, who goes to the A's.

1926
Washington has a ML-record 13 players score in a 19-4 blowout over the
visiting Browns. Sam Rice reaches base twice on errors in the 8th inning
to tie a ML record. Stanley Coveleski is the winning pitcher.

1927
Detroit's Jackie Tavener steals 2B, 3B and home in the 4th inning to lead
the Tigers to a 6-3 win over the Yankees.

1928
Although the Indians bang out 14 hits, the Tribe fails to score a run in a
9-0 night cap loss to the Senators in a Griffith Stadium twin bill. It is
only the second time a team has been shut out after collecting that many hits.

Washington P Milt Gaston surrenders 14 hits, including two doubles and a
triple, in a 9-0 shutout over Cleveland, setting an AL record for a 9-inning
game and tying the ML standard. Jake Miller takes the loss for the Tribe.

The Pirates sell C Earl Smith to the Cards.

1929
The Pirates outslug the Phillies 15-9 at the Baker Bowl. Pittsburgh hits
5 HRs and the Phils 4, with one HR coming in each inning, a virtually
insurmountable ML record.

Cleveland pitcher Wes Ferrell hits the first of his ML 38 homeruns, the top
mark for pitchers. Washington's Bump Hadley serves up today's gopher. Bibb
Falk adds a homer as the Indians and Ferrell win, 9-7.

For the 2nd time in 3 days, Marty McManus hits a grand slam, one of his
3 hits, and his homer is the difference in Detroit's 10-6 win over the
visiting Red Sox. Milt Gaston is the loser, giving up 14 hits in 6 innings.

1930
Fred Lindstrom has 5 hits to lead the Giants to a 19-8 rout the Phillies. This
is the 3rd time he has accomplished this feat. The Giants score 10 runs in
the 3rd and pound 3 pitchers for 26 hits. Chuck Klein hits his 25th homer
in the 6th.

1932
An extraordinary 18-inning game is finally won by the Athletics at Cleveland,
18-17. To save train fare for the single-date appearance, Connie Mack takes
along just 2 pitchers. Lew Krausse Sr the A's starting pitcher, gives up
4 hits in the 1st inning and his replacement, Eddie Rommel then pitches 17
innings in relief, giving up a record 29 hits (and walking 9). Amazingly,
he wins. Cleveland has the game apparently won in the 9th inning but with
two outs and leading 14-13, first sacker Ed Morgan allows a ground ball by
Dykes to roll through his legs. A walk to Simmons and a single by Jimmie
Foxx, one of his 6 hits in the game, ties the score. Cleveland's Johnny
Burnett sets a ML record by collecting 9 hits in 11 at-bats, while Foxx
bangs HR #31, 32 and 33. Double X totals 16 bases in the game, the 3rd AL
player to do it, and drives in 8 runs, including the winner. Wes Ferrell
(16-6) is the hard luck loser, pitching 11+ innings of relief two days
after pitching a complete-game win over Washington. Cleveland sets an AL
record for stranded runners with 24.

1934
The 2nd annual All-Star Game played in New York's Polo Grounds produces
Carl Hubbell's amazing feat of striking out 5 future Hall of Famers in
a row. Off to a shaky start with 2 on base in the first inning, Hubbell
uses his screwball to fan Ruth, Gehrig and Foxx. He adds Al Simmons and
Joe Cronin to start the 2nd. After 3 scoreless innings he leaves with the
NL ahead 4-0. The AL rallies, scoring 9 runs off Warneke, Van Lingle Mungo
(the eventual loser) and Dean. Meanwhile Mel Harder pitches 5 shutout innings
in relief of Red Ruffing to hold the lead. Frisch and Medwick hit HRs. Earl
Averill's 3 RBIs are decisive for the AL's 9-7 victory.

1935
Beating the Tulsa Oilers, 1-0, Galveston Buccaneers hurler Ed Cole throws
the first perfect game in Texas League history. The decisive hit is an
inside-the-park homerun with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.

Hal Schumacher wins his 11th consecutive game as the Giants beat the Pirates,
10-3. Hank Lieber has 3 hits for New York.

The Tigers' win streak of 14 ends, despite a record-tying 10 doubles in a
12-11 loss in Washington.

At Cincinnati, the Reds' Babe Herman hits the first night homer in history,
off Dutch Leonard, to lead the Reds to a 15-2 win over Brooklyn. The Reds
score 8 in the 3rd. There were 3 previous night games, all of which went
homerless.

1936
Philadelphia's Chuck Klein hits four HRs in 5 at-bats in a 10-inning game
at Forbes Field. His final HR, on the first pitch in the 10th, helps
beat the Pirates 9-6, and makes a winner out of Bucky Walters. Except
for his three-run homer off Jim Weaver in the 1st, all of homers are solo
flights. At 36, Klein is the oldest player ever to hit 4 homers in a game,
and the first National Leaguer in the 20th century to do so.

The Yankees roll to an easy victory over the Indians, as Red Ruffing takes
the shutout, 18-0. Lloyd Brown, the first of 3 pitchers, is the loser. Gehrig
has a pair of homers to take over the AL lead with 23.

Bobo Newsom pitches one-hit ball in blanking the Tigers, 5-0. The lone hit
off the Washington pitcher is Jack Burns' 3rd-inning grounder that both the
first baseman and the 2nd baseman go after. 2B Kuhel stops the ball but no
one covers the bag.

1937
The Red Sox sweep a pair from the A's, winning 9-2 and 5-3. Cronin had a
pair of homers in the opener to back starter Lefty Grove, who exits after
5 innings because of the heat. Foxx and Mills also bust homers. In the
11-inning nitecap, pitcher Lynn Nelson plays LF and belts a triple and homer.

At Detroit, the Indians and Tigers combine for 25 extra base hits as
they divide a twinbill. The Tigers win the opener, 12-11, and the Indians
the nitecap, 8-7. Hal Trosky has a homer in the opener and 2 more in the
nitecap. Schoolboy Rowe wins his 1st game of the season pitching in relief
in game 1.

1940
Boston Bees OF Max West, a late replacement for Mel Ott, hits a 3-run HR in
the first inning to lead the NL to a 4-0 victory over the AL in the All-Star
Game at Sportsman's Park. It is the first shutout in All-Star history. Joe
Cronin directs the AL when Joe McCarthy steps aside, stating he has "had
the honor often enough."

1943
Today's Dodger game is almost anticlimactic to a pregame attempted strike
by the players following Leo Durocher's 3-game suspension of P Bobo Newsom,
the team's leading pitcher with 9 wins, for insubordination. Minutes before
the game, SS Arky Vaughan handed his uniform to Durocher and refused to
play. Durocher called for volunteers to play, but by game time he had just a
battery of Curt Davis and Bobby Bragan. Branch Rickey intervened, and Vaughan
and the others agreed to play. Vaughan and Durocher will never make up and
Vaughan will sit out the next 3 seasons, ostensibly to help the war effort
by farming, rather than play for The Lip. Only with Durocher's suspension
in 1947 will the future Hall of Famer return to the Dodgers. Newsom, 9-4,
will be traded to the Browns on July 15th. When the game, designated "Kitchen
Fat Day" to allow women a free ticket if they bring one pound of fat to the
game (5,002 pounds of fat are collected for the war effort) finally starts,
the Dodgers wallop the Pirates, 23-6, scoring the most runs they will in a
game the rest of this century. Only twice in team history have they scored
more:  25 on May 20, 1896 and on September 23, 1901.

Homestead Grays owner Rufus "Sonnyman" Jackson is jailed after a confrontation
with Mexicans trying to sign his players. Jackson will retain his players
and win the Negro League World Championship.

1947
In a rain-interrupted game before 47,871, Don Black of the Cleveland Indians
pitches a no-hitter, beating the Philadelphia Athletics, 3-0, in the first
game of a doubleheader. It is the largest crowd ever to see a no-hitter and
it is the first at Municipal Stadium. Black, waived from the A's in 1945,
walks six, but retires the last 10 batters. Bob Feller wins the nitecap,
2-1, for his 11th victory.

James "Stormy" Davis, 20-year-old outfielder for Ballinger (Longhorn
League), dies as a result of being hit in the head by a pitched ball in a
game against Sweetwater on July 3. He was hitting .333 with 19 HR in 48 games.

In St. Louis, Yankee relief P Joe Page stops the Browns and hits a 9th-inning
HR to win the game, 4-3.

1948
For the 6th time this year, Vern Stephens and Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox
hit back-to-back homers as Boston beats the 2nd-place A's, 4-0. Jack Kramer
scatters 9 hits in the shutout to win his 7th straight. Ted Williams sits out
the game with a damaged ligament, the result of being hit in the ribs while
playfully sparring with Sam Mele on the train down from Boston yesterday.

1950
The Giants pick up P Jim Hearn on waivers from St. Louis.

1951
Exploding for a record 4 HRs, the NL trounces the AL, 8-3, at the annual
All-Star Game, at Briggs Stadium in Detroit. Pittsburgh slugger Ralph Kiner
hits a HR for the 3rd year in a row.

The Giants bring up 2B Davey Williams, hitting .280 at Minneapolis, and
pitcher Al Corwin. Williams is expected to shore up 2B with Eddie Stanky.

1952
The A's top the Indians, 11-1, behind Alex Kellner's 4-hitter and the 3
for 3 hitting by Elmer Valo, who drives in 4 runs. Ferris Fain runs his
hitting streak to 22 games.

1953
The Red Sox beat the A's, 3-2, in the 12th when Mariano Fricano walks
Jim Piersall with the sacks full. Piersall's homer in the 9th ties the
game. Ellis Kinder is the winner.

The first-place Dodgers set a NL record by hitting a HR in their 24th
straight game, with this roundtripper by Roy Campanella coming off the
Giants' Sal Maglie. The Bums have hit 39 HRs in the streak. The homer is
the only run Maglie allows, besting the Dodgers, 6-1, for New York's 7th
win in a row. Maglie is 18-3 against the Dodgers since returning from the
Mexican League.

The Pirates and Phils combine for 10 errors, but the Phils find Pirate
hurling for 12 hits in a 13-3 thrashing. Curt Simmons wins over Murry Dickson.

The Dodgers waive pitcher Ralph Branca, to the Tigers. Branca, who appeared
in just 7 games this year, never recovered from an off-season pelvic injury.

1954
Bob Rush of the Cubs stops Cardinal 2B Red Schoendienst's hitting streak
at 28 games, the longest batting streak in 1954. But the Cards win, 2-1,
scoring 2 in the 9th.

Despite giving up two solo homers to Mantle, the Nat's Dean Stone holds on
for a 6-4 win in Washington in the 1st of a twinbill. Carlos Paula homers
in the 5th off Whitey Ford for the first Washington hit, then later adds
a double. In the nitecap, Mantle homers off Ted Abernathy to help New York
win, 8-3.

1956
In the All-Star Game, the first-place Reds vote five starters on the team -
and three runner-ups - all the result of an enthusiastic get-out-the-vote
campaign by Cincy radio stations and newspapers. Next year the issue will
come to a head. In the game, Ken Boyer of the Cardinals makes 3 sparkling
plays at 3B and gets 3 hits as the NL defeats the AL, 7-3. Willie Mays,
Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams and Stan Musial all homer. Mays' pinch-hit
2-run HR off Whitey Ford is his 7th straight hit against the Yankee lefty.

1958
Pitcher Lew Burdette of Milwaukee hits 2 homers and a NL record-tying
(for pitchers) 5 RBIs, and beats the Dodgers 8-4. (Tony Cloninger will
tie Burdette's mark in 1966, then set the NL mark.) Burdette was the last
pitcher to hit 2 homers (August 13, 1957). He'll total 12 for his career.

1962
John F. Kennedy returns to D.C. Stadium and becomes the first president to
throw the ceremonial first pitch at an All-Star Game. Earlier in the season,
JFK had also thrown the ceremonial first pitch at the Senators' home opener
in the first game played in Washington's new $23-million ballpark. Roberto
Clemente has 3 hits as the NL wins, 3-1, in the first All-Star Game of 1962,
at DC Stadium.

victory over the White Sox.

1968

and play-off format. Each league will divide their twelve teams into two
six-team divisions playing a best-of-five game league championship series to
determine the pennant winner. The NL breaks down its 2 divisions for 1969
thus ... Eastern:  New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Montreal, Chicago,
St. Louis; Western:  Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Cincinnati,
San Diego, Atlanta.

Hank Bauer is fired as manager of the Orioles, but the Birds win today,
beating Detroit, 5-3. Pitcher Dave McNally has his 1st hit in 42 at-bats,
a 2-run homer that is the difference in the 5-3 win.

1969
The Cubs score 5 runs in the 5th inning to beat the Mets, 6-2, behind Bill
Hands. The win halts the Mets' seven-game win streak and leaves the New
Yorkers in 2nd place by 4 games.

1970
The Padres launch 4 HRs in the 9th inning against LA but the power display
comes too late and the Dodgers win, 9-7. Wes Parker has 2 doubles and
a triple for LA. For the Padres, Murrell, Spiezio and Campbell hit solo
homers off Bill Singer, and Gaston connects for a 2-run homer off Pena. The
barrage is one short of the record.

Reds SS Woodie Woodward goes deep for his first and only ML homer, off
Ron Reed in Atlanta. It comes in his 684th ML game (1672 AB). It is too
little as the Braves top the Reds, 11-9. The Reds take the nitecap, 3-1,
scoring 2 runs when Pat Corrales hits a long drive that glances off the
glove of Hank Aaron and over the fence for a HR. Rose is 5 for 5, all singles.

1979
Trailing the Padres 5-3 in the bottom of the ninth with two outs at Veterans
Stadium, pinch hitter Del Unser hits a three-run walk-off home run giving
the Phillies a 6-5 comeback victory. The dramatic dinger makes Del Unser
only the second player in major league history to hit a homer in three
consecutive at-bats as a pinch hitter (June 30th, July 5th), a feat also
accomplished by Lee Lacy of the Dodgers last season.

Scoring 4 runs in the 13th after 2 are out, the Giants beat the Expos,
11-7. Losing pitcher Woodie Fryman balks in the last run. In the 4th inning,

Evans at 1B for a 9-3 putout.

1982
The Rangers' Larry Parrish hits his 3rd grand slam of the week in a 6-5

against Boston.

1983
It takes Milwaukee 4 hours 11 minutes to beat Chicago 12-9, the slowest
9-inning game in AL history.

The Giants sweep a pair from the Cubs, winning 10-8 and 4-2. In the nitecap,
Giants RF Jack Clark throws out Junior Kennedy 9-3. It is the 3rd time in
2 years Clark has done it ... he did on July 30, 1981 to Reds P Charlie
Puleo and on September 20, 1981 to Nolan Ryan.

1984
At San Francisco's Candlestick Park, Dodger southpaw Fernando Valenzuela and
Mets rookie Dwight Gooden combine to strike out six consecutive American
League all-stars on the 50th anniversary of Carl Hubbell's memorable 1934
Midsummer Classic performance of setting down five future Hall of Famers on
strikes. Dwight Gooden, at the age of 19, becomes the youngest player ever
to participate in an All-Star game. After Valenzuela whiffs Dave Winfield,
Reggie Jackson and George Brett in the 4th inning, Gooden fans Lance Parrish,
Chet Lemon and Alvin Davis in the 5th. The National League beats the Junior
Circuit, 3-1. Home runs hit by Expos catcher Gary Carter, the game's MVP,
and Braves outfielder Dale Murphy prove to be the difference.

1986
Oil Can Boyd (11-6) flies into a rage after learning that he has been left
off the AL All-Star team and storms out of Fenway Park prior to Boston's
game against the Angels. He will be suspended indefinitely by the Red Sox
and eventually scuffle with local police before checking into a hospital
for psychiatric testing. The weirdness continues as the Angels score 3 in
the 12th to take a 7-4 lead. Boston then scores 3 to tie and when Fischer
replaces Cook, he balks in Dwight Evans with the winning run.

1987
At Yankee Stadium, Don Mattingly greets White Sox reliever Joel McKeon with
a grand slam to pace the Yankees to a 9-5 win over Chicago.

1990

1999
At Leland's 'Hero's Auction' of sports memorabilia held in New York,
the ball batted by Carlton Fisk in the 12th inning, which hit the Fenway
foul pole ending one of the most dramatic games in World Series history,
is sold for $113,273. George Foster, the Reds' left fielder who retrieved
and kept the 1975 historic homerun ball, decided to sell the souvenir after
realizing its potential value after Mark McGwire's 70th homerun ball sold
for almost $3 million.

The Tigers defeat the Brewers, 9-3, before 25,374 fans in Detroit. This
enables the club to top the 1 million mark in attendance for the 35th
consecutive season for the longest streak in AL history. The Dodgers hold
the record of 55 consecutive years.

Matt Franco's 2-out PH single in the bottom of the 9th drives home 2 runs
and gives the Mets a 9-8 win over the Yankees in a thrilling interleague
battle. By doing so, the Mets end the Yankees' streak of 125 consecutive
victories when leading after 8 innings.

Was it something I said, fellas? For his 4th loss in a row, the Diamondbacks

2000
Sammy Sosa wins the All-Star Game Home Run Derby by defeating defending
champ, Ken Griffey Jr, in the finals.

2001
In his final All-Star appearance, Cal Ripken is named the MVP of the game. His
homerun along with consecutive dingers from Derek Jeter and Magglio Ordonez
power the AL to its fifth victory in a row beating the National League at
Seattle's Safeco Field, 4-1. Derek Jeter is the first Yankee to homer in
an All-Star game in 41 years when he goes deep off Jon Lieberman leading
off the sixth inning at Safeco Field. Yogi Berra was the last Bronx Bomber
to accomplish the feat, homering off Don Drysdale in 1959.

2002
Clemson SS Khalil Greene is named winner of the 2002 Golden Spikes Award
as the nation's top amateur baseball player.

2003
The Republicans defeat the Democrats in the annual Roll Call Congressional
Baseball Game, 5-3. The Republican victory is a mild upset since the GOP was
without their star pitcher from past years, former Oklahoma Congressman Steve
Largent. Roll Call began sponsoring the game annually in 1962 and since then
the Republicans lead the Democrats, 28-14. The game was originally organized
in 1909 by former major-leaguer John Tener, a Republican Congressman from
Pennsylvania, but was played only intermittently until Roll Call stepped in.

2006
Ryan Howard of the Phillies outslugs David Wright of the Mets to win the
All-Star Home Run Derby.

2009

Randy Johnson, sees his bid for a perfect game end when third baseman Juan
Uribe makes an error in the eighth inning.

2013
David Ortiz establishes a new record for career hits by a designated
hitter when he doubles in the second inning of the Red Sox' 11-4 victory
over Seattle at Safeco Field. 'Big Popi' surpasses Harold Baines with his
