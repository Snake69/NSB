Jul 19

1901
In Chicago, Jack Taylor allows 10 hits to the Giants, but is unscored on
until the 9th. The Colts paste Mathewson for 12 hits to win, 5-2. Chicago
has now won three in a row over the visiting New Yorkers, and will take
the next two games in the series as well.

1902
The last-place Giants lose their first game under new manager John McGraw,
4-3, to the Phillies. They will end the season in last place with a record
of 48-88 and 53 1/2 games behind the pennant winning Pirates. In part to
make room for the four new Orioles who have landed in New York, McGraw
releases 9 Giants.

Snake Wiltse, sold by the A's to Baltimore, leaves Philadelphia today to join
his new team. Snake's younger brother Hooks will join the Giants in 2 years.

1904
The Pirates push across two runs in the 9th against Christy Mathewson to
edge the first-place Giants, 2-1.

1905
The Pirates pull to within 5 games of New York by overcoming a 5-2 deficit
and beating the Giants, 8-5. Bill Klem provokes a barrage of garbage from
the New York fans by tossing Dan McGann and Mike Donlin out of the game
for abusive behavior.

1906
The Giants, behind Iron Joe McGinnity, beat Chicago's Ed Reulbach,
5-2. Reulbach (7-4) will win his next 12 games to finish the season at 19-4
with an ERA of 1.65.

1907
At the Polo Grounds, the visiting Cubs beat up on the Giants, winning 12-3.

1908
Walter Justis, pitching for Lancaster (Ohio State L), hurls the first of
his three no-hitters this season, beating Mansfield, 6-0. He strikes out 5.

1909
During the top of the second inning of a 6-1 win over the Red Sox at
Cleveland's League Park, Neal Ball executes the first unassisted triple play
in the post-1900 era of baseball. The Naps (Indians) shortstop catches a
Ambrose McConnell line drive, steps on second to force out Heinie Wagner and
then tags Jake Stahl for the third out as he comes from first base. Ball
also records nine putouts at shortstop, another big league first. The
diminutive infielder's glove from that game will be enshrined at the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown. In the last of the 2nd, Ball hits his first AL homer,
an inside-the-park shot, and adds a double. Cy Young wins the first game
and Boston wins the nitecap, 3-2.

1910
In an 11-inning contest played at American League Park, Cy Young beats
the Senators, 5-4, to earn his 500th career victory. (It is his 213th AL
win.) The 43-year-old Naps (Indians) right-hander will finish his 22-year
tenure in the major leagues with 511 wins, first on the all-time list,
well ahead of Walter Johnson's second place total of 417.

Chief Meyer cracks a 2-run single off Art Fromme in the 11th to give the
Giants a 6-4 win over the Reds. Mathewson wins his 15th straight over
the Reds.

1911
With the score tied at 3-3 in the 6th inning, Vernon CF (Pacific Coast League)
and former circus acrobat, Walter Carlisle executes an unassisted triple play
against Los Angeles. With men on 1B and 2B, he makes a spectacular diving
catch of a short fly by batter Roy Akin, touches 2B, and runs to 1B to retire
both runners. Vernon wins, 5-4, with the speedy English-born Carlisle pulling
off the only unassisted triple play ever accomplished by an outfielder in O.B.

1912
Ty Cobb strokes 7 hits in a doubleheader split to give him a ML record of
14 in 2 consecutive twin bills against the Athletics. Detroit wins, 8-6,
before falling, 14-6. Bill White will tie Cobb in 1961. Cobb also pummeled
them for 7 hits on the 17th on his way to collecting an incredible 68 hits
for the month, a record.

1914
Behind reliever Paul Strand, the Braves get 3 runs in the 9th off Earl
Yingling to beat the Reds, 3-2, and climb out of last place on their way to
the pennant. During that journey, they will pass the Reds going the other
way, as today's loss starts the Reds' fall from 2nd place to last.

1915
The Senators come out running, stealing a ML record 8 bases (tied in the
NL in 1919) against the Cleveland Indians in the first inning. Sore-armed
catcher Steve O'Neill is the victim of 3 SBs by Danny Moeller including
2B, 3B and home, 2 each by Clyde Milan and Ed Ainsmith, and one by George
McBride in the 11-4 Washington win. Walter Johnson (15-8) allows just two
hits in 6 innings before taking the afternoon off. Reliever Nick Altrock
gives up the Cleveland scores.

1916
At Chicago, the Giants edge the Cubs, 8-6, as New York CF Benny Kauff
tags out two runners at 2B for a double play. With one out the Cubs load
the bases. Giant catcher Bill Rariden throws to 2B and catches the runner,
Les Mann, off. In the rundown, the runner on 3rd breaks for home and scores
when the Giants fumble. But the ball is recovered and the throw to Kauff
covering 2nd gets the runner sliding back. Kauff then looks up and tags
the runner trying to advance from 1B to end the inning.

1917
The Browns' Allen Sothoron defeats the Senators and Walter Johnson, 4-2.

In Chicago, Babe Ruth opens a 5-game series with the front-running Chisox,
by pitching 2nd-place Boston to a 3-2 win.

1918
Washington C Eddie Ainsmith applies for deferment from the
draft. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker rules that baseball is not an
essential occupation and all players of draft age are subject to the
"work-in-essential-industries-or-fight" rule. Ban Johnson says the AL will
close down July 21st, a pronouncement that upsets the owners, but the next
day both leagues vote to continue. A week later, Baker exempts players from
the rule until September 1st. Both leagues vote to cut the season short,
and end on Labor Day, September 2nd.

The Braves score 4 in the first against the Reds, knocking out Jimmy Ring
for the 1st time since joining the team. But Cincinnati comes back to win,
6-4. with Mike Regan, in relief, winning over Dick Rudolph. The Braves
strand 12 and commit 5 miscues to help the Cincy cause.

At Fenway, the Peach-less Tigers fall to the first-place Red Sox, 5-0,
managing just 3 hits off Carl Mays, one less than Stuffy McInnis has. Old
Bill Bailey takes the loss for the Bengals, who play without Ty Cobb. Ty,
suffering from a sore shoulder, missed the train back from New York where,
according to the Tigers' players, he had gone to enlist.

1919
Cincinnati beats the Braves, 4-2 in 13 innings, winning the game on a Heinie
Groh homerun. In the opening inning, the Reds got another home run from
catcher Bill Rariden, when he bounces a liner that hits the scoreboard. The
young scorekeeper had neglected to close one of the inning openings and
the ball bounds through for a four-bagger.

Behind new manager Tris Speaker, who goes 3 for 3, the Indians defeat the
Red Sox, 7-4. Ruth doubles off the wall and gets an intentional pass.

1920
At the Polo Grounds, the Babe sets a record with his 30th homer and adds
another blast, both off Dickie Kerr, but the Yankees lose to the White
Sox, 8-5. Joe Jackson and Roger Peckinpaugh also homer. In the opener,
Bob Shawkey, making his first start since being injured June 23rd, wins
8-2, giving up an unearned run and another in the 9th after he allows
Al Schalk to reach 2B and 3B unmolested. Shawkey wins his 10th straight.
The historic homerun breaks his own season mark of 29 and the 'Rajah of Rap'
finishes the season with a resounding 54 round-trippers.

The Cubs' Hippo Vaughn shuts out the Braves, 5-0, and his three-run homer
in the 3rd off Dick Rudolph is all the scoring he needs.

1924
Cardinals hurler Hi Bell goes the distance in both games of a Sportsman's Park
doubleheader beating the Braves, 6-1 and 2-1. The 27-year-old right-hander
from Kentucky will be the last National League pitcher to win two complete
game victories in one day.

Cards rookie righthander Herman Bell, who will win just 32 games, wins a
pair today. He holds the Braves hitless until one out in the 8th of the
first of 2 games. Then he does the same until one out in the 5th of game 2,
winning both 6-1 and 2-1. He allows only 6 hits in the twin-bill wins. Bell
will total just 3 wins this year. He is the last pitcher in the NL to throw
two complete games in one day.

1927
It's John McGraw Day at the Polo Grounds, in honor of his 25 years as Giants
manager. With Mayor Jimmy Walker, Commissioner Landis, assorted celebrities
and former players on hand, the Cubs spoil the day with an 8-5 win. The
Giants are now in 4th place and McGraw, suffering from upper respiratory
ailments, will increasingly hand the managerial reins to Hornsby. The Giants
bite the bullet and release Joe Bush.

1928
Ruth leads the way again, with a pair of 2-run homers, to give the Yankees
a 6-4 win over the White Sox. Al Thomas takes the loss, his 13th consecutive
to New York in as many games over the past 2 seasons.

1929
With more than 50,000 fans in attendance to watch a twin bill against the
Red Sox, an unusually violent storm hits Yankee Stadium in the bottom of
the fifth inning. An ensuing stampede in the bleachers results in two deaths
and with another seventy-five reported to be hurt.

1930
The Cubs take a 3-1 lead against Brooklyn's Dazzy Vance, who is lifted in
the 8th, then score two more on an error by reliever Joe DeBerry. Chicago
hangs on for a 5-4 win behind Joe Osborne.

1932
In St. Louis, the A's sweep a pair from the Browns, winning 9-8 and
16-6. Jimmie Foxx collects 3 doubles and an inside-the-park homer in the
pair. The homer is his 40th. Cleveland stays a game behind the 2nd-place
A's with a 7-0 win over Boston.

1933
Red Sox C Rick Ferrell hits his HR off brother Wes of Cleveland in the 4th
inning, and Wes answers in the same inning, hitting one off Hank Johnson. Wes
wins, 8-7. This is the first time brothers on opposing teams homer in the
same game. Wes will wind up his career with 38 HRs in 548 games. Rick will
hit only 28 in 1,884 games.

With his team in last place, Browns manager Bill Killefer calls it
quits. Coach Allen Sothoron will fill in until a manager is hired.

1934
The Reds pound 12 hits against the Giants' Hal Schumacher but don't score
as the Prince shuts them out, 4-0.

1936
After winning their 9th straight, 11-2, the Indians lose to the Senators
in the nitecap, 9-6, in DC. Seventeen year-old Iowa farm boy, Bob Feller
makes his ML debut in relief pitching the 8th inning of game 2, giving up no
hits, walking two and fanning one. (The boxscore says he struck out none,
but Feller claims the boxscore is wrong - he claims to have struck out
Buddy Lewis in his autobiography.)

The White Sox continue to pound the A's pitching, winning their second
straight doubleheader, 11-5 and 8-2.

1937
Pitcher Johnny Broaca is fined $250 and suspended indefinitely by the
Yankees for jumping the club. On the 13th, the Yanks announced Broaca had
a torn ligament in the socket of his right arm. The Yanks will recall Spud
Chandler to take Broaca's spot.

1938
In game 1, Harl Maggert drives in 2 runs in the 8th, and Whitey Moore pitches
a 2-hitter to lead the Reds to a 2-0 win over the visiting Braves. In the
nitecap, Boston pitchers nail 4 Reds batters to tie a NL record for the
20th century as the Reds win, 7-2. Hutchinson plunks one and Bobby Reis
pops 3 in 7 2/3 innings.

1939
Arky Vaughan hits for the cycle to pace the Pirates to a 10-2 win over
the Giants.

1940
Catcher Buddy Rosar hits for the cycle and Babe Dahlgren homers twice to lead
the Yanks to a 15-6 win over Cleveland. Gomez and Murphy combine for the win.

At Wrigley, Hank Lieber hits a 1st-inning grand slam as the Cubs blast the
Dodgers, 11-4. In the 8th inning, Chicago's Swish Nicholson adds a 2-run
HR, but the real action comes after Brooklyn P Hugh Casey plunks Chicago
pitcher Claude Passeau in the back with a pitch. When Passeau throws his bat
at Casey, both benches erupt. Dodger reserve Joe Gallagher and Passeau are
tossed, but the pitcher picks up his 11th win of the year. The bat-tossing
will cost Passeau $75.

Prior to the Giants' 7-6 win in St. Louis, Babe Ruth tops all competitors
in a hitting competition with a drive of 430 feet, the ball landing in the
second car tracks of Grand Avenue. Medwick is second with a clout of 425
feet over the left field barrier into Sullivan Avenue. Ruth receives $50
and Medwick $25. The US Army measures the drives.

1941
The Browns take two from the visiting Red Sox, 9-3 and 4-3. George McQuinn
hits for the cycle in game 1 for St. Louis.

1942
The Brooklyn lead of 8 games is cut as the Cards win 3 of 4. The larger blow,
however, is a concussion suffered by Pete Reiser after crashing into an OF
wall at Sportsman's Park chasing an Enos Slaughter 11th-inning fly. Reiser
drops the ball upon impact, and Slaughter scores an inside-the-park HR
for a 7-6 Cards win. Hitting .379 at the time, Reiser will see his average
fall to .310 after the injury. His 20 stolen bases will still lead the NL,
and he will finish the year not having grounded into a DP.

Playing without Williams and Doerr, the Red Sox drop a doubleheader against
the Indians at Fenway Park, losing 10-7 in 12 innings, and 4-0 in a 7-inning
nitecap. Boudreau has 3 hits in each game to lead his charges. Sox pitcher
Mike Ryba catches in both games, as the 3rd backstop in the opener, and
the starter (0 for 2) in the nitecap before Doerr pinch hits for him in
the 7th. Mel Harder allows 3 hits in game 2 to win.

1945
Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Admiral Nimitz ask baseball commissioner
Happy Chandler today to make arrangements to send the World Series winner
"on a tour (90 days) of the Pacific Ocean to play Army and Navy teams at
advance bases." Mr. Forrestal is so enthusiastic that he adds in a letter
to Chandler:  "It may persuade more Japs to surrender because the one thing
they all want to know is:  'who's leading the leagues?' Connie Mack voices
approval saying, "It will do the boys in service a world of good to see
the 1945 world champions in person on the diamond." But the war will end
in less than a month and the tour never takes place.

Cubs pitcher Hank Wyse wins his 7th straight, and 13th of the season,
setting down the Dodgers, 3-1, on five hits. The league leaders have now
won 20 games against 5 defeats since June 27th.

The Reds win the opener against the Braves, 4-3, in the ninth on a single by
Woody Williams. Boston wins the nitecap in 10 innings, 6-5. Butch Nieman's
three run homer ties the game in the 7th and he scores the winning run in
the 10th on Carden Gillenwater's single. After the nitecap, umpire George
Magerkurth gets into a fight with a fan, but players break up the fisticuffs.

The Pirates win, 4-0, over the Giants, as Bill Salkeld climaxes the scoring
with a three-run homer in the 8th. Rip Sewell wins his 11th of the year,
while Harry Feldman is the loser. Salkeld hits his homer off Ace Adams,
who relieves Feldman in the 8th.

1946
In a Boston-Chicago game, umpire Red Jones issues a warning to the Sox pitcher
(Joe Haynes) after a beanball is thrown at Ted Williams. Hearing razzing from
the Sox dugout, Jones tosses the alleged perpetrator OF Ralph Hodgin and 3
others. When the jeering keeps up, 3 more Sox are tossed. The wisecracks
continue and the incensed Jones clears the bench, ejecting a total of 14
White Sox in all, leaving only the starters. The White Sox lose the game as
well, 9-2. It was reported for years the home plate arbitrator's ire may
have been raised by a ventriloquist sitting behind the visitors' dugout,
but during recent interviews with the participants of the game played sixty
years ago, it is revealed many of them believe the incident was precipitated
by third-base coach Mule Hass, who wasn't thrown out of the game but was
known to be more than capable of making rude sounds and infuriating remarks.

1948
At Boston, Mel Parnell wins stopping the Browns, 4-1, as his infielders
tally 11 assists. The Sox score all their runs in the 1st on Bobby Doerr's
grand slam.

1949
At New York, the Giants use a 20-hit attack to score in every inning as they
beat the Reds, 13-3. Lockman and Marshall each have 4 hits. In tomorrow's
5-1 win against the Reds, the Giants score in each of the first three
innings. Combined with yesterday's effort of scoring in the last 3 frames
against the Cards, the Giants match the 1894 Pittsburgh team (July 31 -
August 2) and top the 20th century mark of 12 set by the 1922 Giants. The
mark will next be matched by the Colorado Rockies. The ML record of 17
innings is held by the Boston Americans, September 15 - 17, 1903.

For the second time this year, Ken Heintzelman of the Reds shuts out the
Cubs, 1-0. Doyle Lade takes the loss.

1950
The Yankees obtain their first black players, OF Elston Howard and P Frank
Barnes. They purchase them from the Kansas City Monarchs and assign them
to Muskegon (Central League).

2-hitter in the first game of a doubleheader.

At Fenway, Vern Stephens crashes a 3-run HR, his 200th career homer, in the
first off Red Hutchinson. Detroit wins, 9-5, with a little help in the 9th
from ump Boyer - Boyer calls time just before PH Wright triples to CF. In
his do-over, Wright grounds out. Stephens joins 5 other active players with
more than 200 homers:  DiMaggio, Mize, Williams, Gordon and Nicholson.

Frank E. McKinney resigns as president of the Pirates. He sells interests
in the club to John Galbreath and T. Johnson, with Galbreath assuming the
presidency. Vice President Bing Crosby retains his minority interest.

The Pirates purchase 3B Bob Dillinger from the Athletics for $35,000.

1951
Despite a pair of homers by Clyde Vollmer, the Indians edge the Red Sox,
5-4, in 11 innings. Bobby Avila scores the winner from 1B on a single as
Ted Williams holds the ball. Cleveland's win moves them 1 1/2 games in back
of Boston.

Cleveland picks up OF Paul Lehner from the Browns for the waiver price. For
Lehner, the Tribe is the 4th team he plays for this year ... not since
Frank Huelsman in 1904 has an AL player moved so much in a year. Ted Gray,
in 1955, will match it.

1952
Red Sox GM Joe Cronin announces that rookie Jim Piersall, following his
erratic behavior, will take an indefinite leave of absence. This is based
on advice from doctors.

The visiting Fitzgerald club (Georgia State League) sends up 12-year-old
batboy Joe Relford to bat as a pinch hitter in the 8th inning of a game
with Statesboro. The black batboy, who broke the league's color barrier,
grounds out, but makes a fine catch in the outfield when he stays in the
game. Umpire Ed Kubick, who approved the move, will be fired by the league
the next day and Fitzgerald manager Charlie Ridgeway will also be given
his walking papers. Joe Relford? He'll be fired as well.

1953
The Giants' Whitey Lockman leads off the game with a HR for the 2nd day in
a row as the Giants whip the Braves, 7-5. Henry Thompson's 2-run homer in
the 9th is the winner for Ruben Gomez. Dave Jolly is the loser. Milwaukee
takes the nitecap, 2-1, in 5 innings as Al Worthington is scored upon for
the first time in his 3 ML games. Max Surkont wins, giving up just two hits,
both to Al Dark. One of Dark's hits is a homerun.

Boston lefty Mickey McDermott and relief P Ellis Kinder (1 IP) combine for
a one-hitter against Cleveland to win, 2-0. OF Al Smith's 4th-inning single
is the only Tribe safety.

1954
The Red Sox defeat the Orioles, 9-7, on Mickey Owen's 9th inning grand slam.

Hobie Landrith's 12th inning homer off Al Corwin at Crosley Field gives the
Reds a dramatic 1-0 win over the New York Giants. Harry Perkowski goes all
the way for Cincinnati, allowing just 3 hits. Landrith will have 5 extra
base hits this year, all homers.

1955
Playing like the real Babe, Detroit's Babe Birrer pitches 4 innings of
shutout relief, and hits two 3-run homers in a 12-4 win over Baltimore. They
are his only career ribbies and homeruns.

Leading 11-4 over the Phils in the 6th, the Cubs lose 12-11. Jack Meyer is the
winner. This is all part of a disastrous 1-12 road trip in July for Chicago.

Chattanooga (SA) OF Jim Lemon clouts 4 homeruns in the league's All-Star
contest, as the All-Stars defeat the first-place Birmingham club. Lemon
has 7 RBIs.

1956
With the Reds' 4-3 loss to the Pirates at Crosley Field, Brooks Lawrence's

Red Sox, 4-0.

The Yanks' Norm Siebern has his 2nd 5-hit game of the month, against the
Athletics, but New York loses, 6-4.

The Red Sox beat the Tigers, 7-6, in 12 innings at Fenway Park on a Ted
Williams HR.

At Los Angeles, Sandy Koufax starts the 2nd successive game for the last place
Dodgers. He does better than yesterday, when he walked 4 in the 1st and was
lifted, but still loses to Robin Roberts and the Phils, 6-2. Post's homer
in the 8th with a man on breaks up a 2-2 tie. Gilliam makes 3 errors for LA.

1959
Before 57,000 at the Stadium, the Yankees sweep a pair from the visiting
White Sox, winning the nitecap, 6-4, on Mantle's homer off Turk Lown. In
game 1, Yankee veteran Enos Slaughter belts a pair of homers ... at age 43,
he is the oldest player this century to accomplish the feat. Carlton Fisk,
a few months older, will top Slaughter in 1991.

1960
In a spectacular ML debut, Giant Juan Marichal pitches no-hit ball until
Clay Dalrymple's pinch-hit single with 2 out in the 7th. Marichal winds up
with 12 strikeouts and a one-hit 2-0 win against the Phillies at Candlestick
Park. Marichal is the first NL hurler since 1900 to debut with a one-hitter.

Roy Sievers' 21-game hit streak, the longest for any player in 1960, ends,
but White Sox teammate Luis Aparicio's inside-the-park HR and Billy Pierce's
shutout beat Boston, 6-0.

Senators ace Pedro Ramos pitches a one-hitter at Briggs Stadium, beating
Detroit, 5-0. Colavito's leadoff single in the 8th, a grounder that eludes
SS Jose Valdivielso, is the lone safety.

The Yankees outslug the Indians, 13-11, behind the slugging of Bill
Skowron. Skowron follows a Berra blast with his 2nd homer in the 8th but
Cleveland answers with 2 in the bottom of the 8th for an 11-8 lead. Moose
then hits a bases-loaded double in the 9th to win it. Maris hits his 30th
HR and Piersall homers for the Tribe.

1961
The Yanks and Senators split, with Washington winning the nitecap 12-2. Dick
Donovan is the winner. Mantle belts a 500-foot homer in the 4th over the
RF wall.

Ford Frick, an old friend of Babe Ruth's, announces that should Ruth's
record be beaten after 154 games, the record will carry an asterisk. When
asked about the ruling, Maris replies, "A season is a season."

1962
John W. Cox, the owner of the General Packaging Company, as well as the
owner of Yankee Stadium, donates the facility "lock, stock and barrel" to
Rice University, his alma mater. Cox has owned the Stadium since 1955. The
university will derive the income from the rental of the Stadium, while
the land underneath goes to the Knights of Columbus. Rice will relinquish
ownership in 1971, when the city of New York will acquire it through eminent
domain. New York will pay the university $2.5 million as compensation.

1963
With one out and a man on in the 9th, Roy Sievers hits his 300th career
HR to give the Phils a 2-1 win over the Mets. Roger Craig is the victim,

1964
In his major league debut, 23-year-old Indian rookie Luis Tiant throws a
complete-game 11-strikeout four-hit shutout, to beat Whitey Ford and the
Yankees in New York, 3-0. Tiant was brought up yesterday after a 15-1 record
at Portland (AAA). The popular Cuban right-hander will compile a 229-172
record (.571) pitching for six teams during his 19 years in the big leagues.

Chicago edges the A's, 3-2, in the 13th inning when pitcher Gary Peters
socks a pinch homer.

1966
In the first major league game to be played totally on artificial turf,
Houston beats Philadelphia at the Astrodome, 8-2. Prior to this contest,
the outfield (this season) consisted of painted dirt with only the infield
covered with the new material created by Monsanto Company dubbed Astroturf.

At Chicago, Cubs Byron Browne strikes out 5 times against Reds starter Jim
Maloney. The Reds finally win, 3-2, in 18 innings, with Nuxhall victorious
over Fergie Jenkins. Don Pavletich belts a homer in the 18th inning off
Fergie Jenkins. In tomorrow's Reds win over the Cubs, Browne will K another
3 times to set a NL record for two games on his way to leading the NL in
strikeouts with 143.

The Cards edge the Braves, 10-9, with the win going to reliever Nels
Briles. Redbird starter Tracy Stallard gets no decision in his last ML
appearance, but gives up 7 runs in 3+ innings. Stallard is 0 for 1 at bat and
sets a ML record for his 7-year career by receiving no walks in 245 plate
appearances. Joe Torre reaches Stallard for a grand slam in the 1st, then
hits another HR in the 7th to give the Braves a 9-7 lead. Charlie Smith's
2-run HR in the bottom of the inning knots the score. Smith's single in
the 12th drives in the game winner.

1969

house during batting practice. The International League game is postponed
due to "threatening weather."

1972
At Three Rivers Stadium, Luke Walker singles off Cecil Upshaw to break an 0
for 39 drought at the plate. The Pirates' southpaw pitches three innings of
one-hit shutout baseball to pick up a save in the 8-3 victory over the Braves.

1974
Cleveland's Dick Bosman no-hits Oakland 4-0. He has no one but himself to
blame for not picking up a rare perfect game. His throwing error in the 4th
puts the only A's runner on base. The 2 clubs combine to set an AL record
with 2 runners left on base.

1975
At Candlestick Park, Doug Rader, batting eighth, plays the entire game
without getting an official at-bat. The Cardinals walk the Giants catcher
four times, three intentionally, to get to John Montefusco, the Giants
starter who goes 0 for 4 at the plate, but tosses a complete game to get
the win in San Francisco's 5-2 victory.

Yankee C Thurman Munson's first-inning single and RBI against the Twins are
nullified because the tar on his bat handle exceeds the 18-inch limit. Catcher
Glenn Borgmann gets the putout. The Yankees lose, 2-1.

the Sox have George Scott on 2B and Butch Hobson, playing his first game
in weeks because of muscle spasms, on 1B. On a Frank Duffy single, Scott
scores on a close play, prompting an argument by Brews' catcher Charlie

score from first, while Duffy is finally thrown out trying for 3B. Fisk
accounts for the other 3 runs in the inning with his 13th homer of the year.

Against the Phils, Pete Rose beats out a 9th inning bunt to keep his hit

of the matchup on July 14th between the same two starters. The Royals routed
the Tigers, 18-4.
