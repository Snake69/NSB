1902
Left with only 5 players available to play, the Orioles forfeit a game to
St. Louis and their franchise to the league, which borrows players from
other teams and operates the club for the balance of the season.

1903
Rube Waddell is arrested for assaulting a fan who had criticized his
pitching. Connie Mack bails him out of jail. The A's win today, 4-1, over
the visiting Browns.

baseball history, blanking the Penn Park Athletic Club of York, 5-0.

Boston pushes across a run in the 9th to beat the Tigers, 1-0. Norwood

Cleveland knocks Jack Chesbro out of the box in the 6th to easily beat the
host New Yorkers, 11-4. Lajoie, Flick and Conroy have triples, with Bill
Bradely connecting for a homerun, over the LF fence, "the longest hit made
at the new grounds" (New York Herald). Howell pitches the last three innings
for the "Invaders", holding Cleveland without a run.

1905
Reds rookie Orval Overall tosses a one-hit 10-inning 1-0 win over
Philadelphia. The only hit is a weak grounder in the 6th by Red Dooin,
who is safe when Overall is late covering the bag. Overall ignites the 10th
inning rally with a single off Tully Sparks. Harry Steinfeldt's RBI double
is the winner.

1906
The Cubs beat back the Giants, 6-2, as Three Finger Brown tops Christy
Mathewson. Joe Tinker's 2-run homer in the 6th is the big blow for
Chicago. The loss drops the Giants to 6 games behind the Cubs.

1907
Battling for 2nd place, the Pirates defeat the Giants, 2-0, pinning the
loss on Mathewson. The Giants announce that Tommy Corcoran, the 38-year-old
vet whom the Giants picked up before the season started, has been handed
his release.

The last-place Senators down the Tigers, 13-2, as Bob Ganley scores 5 runs.

1908
In another classic matchup, Three Finger Brown and Christy Mathewson pair off
with Brown winning, 1-0. The Cubs' pitcher allows 6 hits, with Matty giving
up 7. The only run comes on a 5th inning inside-the-park homerun by Matty's
nemesis, Joe Tinker, who runs through the arms of 3B coach Heinie Zimmerman
to score. In the 12 matchups between the two pitchers, Brown has won eight. A
tragic occurrence happens during Tinker's home run dash when a boy, standing
on the roof of a nearby building to view the game, falls 50 feet to his death.

It is Honus Wagner Day in Pittsburgh, as players from both teams line up to
pay homage. Wagner's tribute was originally scheduled for the 16th, but Honus
asked that it be moved a day so it would not conflict with the annual benefit
picnic for orphans. Wagner is presented with a $700 gold watch. Pittsburgh
beats Boston, 4-0, to cut the Giants' lead to a half-game over the Bucs.

Despite hitting no homeruns, first-place Detroit rolls over the Athletics,
21-2. Germany Schaefer scores 5 runs.

1909
Red Sox reliever Smoky Joe Wood fans 10 Cleveland batters in just 4 innings,
as visiting Boston wins, 6-4.

Brooklyn and Chicago swap shutouts, with George Bell topping Chicago's
Orval Overall, 1-0, in the opener. Ed Reulbach comes back in the 2nd game
to beat Kaiser Wilhelm, 4-0. Bill Bergen's hitless streak ends. His streak
started after he singled in his first at-bat against the Giants on June 29,
1909. It ends in the second game today when, after sitting out the first game,
he had a fourth inning infield single against Ed Reulbach. The catcher will
hit just .139 this season, not a yearly low.

1910
At Cleveland, Red Sox starter Elmer Steele leaves in the 6th inning leading
5-4. Joe Wood relieves and faces 17 batters over the next 4 innings,
striking out 10 and walking none, as Boston wins 6-4. The scorer gives the
win to Wood, who pitched the better game.

1911
Boston Rustlers' infielder Buck Herzog and OF Doc Miller fail to show up for
a home game against the Cubs - a 12-8 Boston win - and they are suspended
by the club. After a conference with the club president, they rejoin the
team. John McGraw, anxious to retrieve former Giant Herzog to shore up
a weak infield, will trade C Hank Gowdy and SS Al Bridwell to Boston for
Herzog on the 21st. Doc will get traded next year.

1912
In Pittsburgh, the Giants beat the Pirates' Howie Camnitz, 10-2. Mathewson
allows 7 hits in the win.

1913
The visiting Cardinals split a pair with the Giants, winning 4-2 before
losing 3-2. It is not the only split pair today as St. Louis teammates Ted
Cather and Lee Magee are ejected for fighting with each other.

Hello, mudder. A Northern League doubleheader in Virginia, Minnesota is played
in the mud, which helps the hitting of one unusual homerun, as reported in
tomorrow's Minneapolis Journal. "The second game was a seven inning affair
and was marked by the heavy clouting of the visitors. The contests were both
played in mud. Center field flies in deep water went for two hits. Heine
Berger got credit when his hard hit ball got lost in the mire near second
base and he made the circuit before it was recovered." (as noted by Rich Arpi)

1914
At Forbes Field, Rube Marquard and Babe Adams each go a marathon 21
innings before Larry Doyle's 2-run HR gives the Giants a 3-1 win over the
Pirates. Adams yields no walks and 12 hits, the longest non-walk game in ML
history. Marquard walks 2 (one intentional) and yields 15 hits. In the 6th,
Honus Wagner goes from first to 3B on a hit by Jim Viox. When New York CF
Bob Bescher throws to 3B Milt Stock, the ball bounces out of his hands and
disappears. Wagner scores before it's discovered that the ball bounced up
under his arm and stayed there as he ran home. Wagner is called out for
interference, and the Bucs protest. Manager Fred Clarke is then ejected by
umpire Bill "Lord" Byron. Legend provides a fitting ending to this unusual
game as Giants OF Red Murray is knocked unconscious by a bolt of lightning
after catching a fly ball for the final out. Murray is uninjured. This is an
expanded tale based on Murray's catch in an August 1909 game. Marquard's win
is his last in 1914. He will lose 10 straight on his way to a 12-22 record.

Frank Allen of Brooklyn allows just one hit, but 5 errors do him in and
the Cubs win, 3-2. A 2-run 4th for Chicago on no hits, and Good's scoring
after his double in the 6th, completes the Chicago scoring. Brooklyn will
sell Allen to the Pittfeds in September.

Any pennant chances the Senators have go out the window when Clyde "Deerfoot"
Milan and Danny Moeller collide in the outfield with Moeller holding onto
the ball as Milan somersaults over him. Milan's jaw is broken in 2 places
and he will miss 40 games. Cleveland wins, 3-1.

1915
The Cubs end Alexander's 9-game win streak 4-0. Chicago and Philadelphia
are deadlocked for the NL lead. In the AL, the White Sox spend their last
day on top. The Tigers will challenge Boston down the stretch.

In Chicago, the Red Sox top the White Sox, 6-2, to move back into 1st
place. Boston will win 4 out of 5 in the series with their rivals.

1917
The Giants waive little-used George Kelly to Pittsburgh. Kelly will return
to star for New York.

1918
Chicago's Lefty Tyler goes 21 innings, the longest complete game in Cubs
history, against Milt Watson, to beat the Phils, 2-1. Lefty scatters 13 hits
and strikes out 8 in the marathon effort. Three Chicago pinch hitters reach
base in the 21st, and Max Flack drives home the winner with his 5th hit
of the game. Flack scored the game's first run in the first inning. Watson
takes the complete game loss, allowing 19 hits.

The Red Sox sweep two from the Browns, shutting St. Louis out in both
games. Joe Bush takes the first game, 7-0, and Babe Ruth follows, 4-0,
while adding two doubles in two trips to the plate.

1919
The Yankees collect 21 hits and the Browns 17 before St. Louis wins 7-6 in
17 innings. The winning run scores on a squeeze play without a base hit in
the inning.

Boston's Babe Ruth returns to the mound for the first time in 3 weeks,
losing to Cleveland and Guy Morton, 4-0. Ruth is forced to pitch because
of Joe Bush's arm problems and Carl Mays' jumping the team.

1920
The Phils stop the Cards, 1-0, behind the pitching of George Smith. Casey
Stengel leads off the 9th with a walk off Ferdie Schupp and comes around
to score.

The Yankees collect 21 hits, good for forty bases, to starch the White Sox,
20-5. Aaron Ward shines in the field and along with hitting a home run,
a triple, and two singles. Ruth is held to a double and two singles, while
Happy Felsch leads the Sox with four RBIs. With the Indians sweeping two
from Boston, the Yankees trail the Tribe by two games.

1922
At Boston, Ty Cobb gets 5 hits (and a walk) in a game for the 4th time this
year, setting an AL mark. His previous 5-hit contests were on May 7th, July
7th and July 12th. Only Willie Keeler has done it before. The Tigers roar,
16-7, overcoming a 5-0 deficit after one inning.

1923
Miller Huggins' antipathy towards P Carl Mays surfaces as the manager keeps
Mays in the entire game against Cleveland. The Indians light up Mays for 20
hits in the 13-0 win behind George Uhle. Mays' record will be a decent 5-2 in
81 innings, but the Yankees will sell him at the end of the season. Yankee
teammates Ev Scott and Wally Pipp protest the Indian scalping of Mays,
by exiting the game.

At Boston, Reds ace Dolf Luque starts and wins both games of a doubleheader
against the Braves. In game 1, the Cuban cutie is lifted for a pinch hitter
losing 2-0, but the Reds score 4 times to win, 4-3. Luque then pitches a
complete game in game 2 to win, 9-5. He is now 15-2, and will finish the
season with a 12-2 road record.

1924
On Tuberculosis Day at Sportsman's Park, the Cards' future Hall of Famer
Jesse Haines hurls his only shutout in 2 years, a 5-0 no-hitter over the
Braves. "While the majestic northpaw was realizing his lifelong pitching
ambitions, the Cardinals were making merry with the right-hand shoots of
[Tim] McNamara" (St. Louis Globe-Democrat). It is the first no-hitter by a
St. Louis hurler since 1876, and the first-ever NL no-hitter in St. Louis.
'Pop', a 20-game winner last season, will post an 8-19 record for the sixth
place Redbirds.

With two outs in the bottom of the 9th, and the Philadelphia Phillies'
Bill Hubbell on the mound, the Chicago Cubs' Cliff Heathcote steals home
to give the Cubs a 3-2 win.

1927
Hughie Critz accounts for all of the Reds runs in a 3-2 win over host
Boston. Critz has a 2-run inside-the-park HR in the 4th that bounces over
Walsh's head in CF, and his single in the 10th scores Pipp from 2B.

1930
Dazzy Vance makes his first relief appearance of the year, holding the Cubs
scoreless in the 9th inning of a 3-3 game. But Chicago scores 3 in the 13th
off Dazzy to win, 6-3. Footsie Blair, who scored in the first after a triple,
starts the rally in the 13th with a one out single. Reliever Guy Bush takes
home the win.

1931
The Indians' Wes Ferrell allows 3 hits, including a homer by Babe Ruth,
in subduing the Yankees, 2-1, in 8 innings. Rain shortens the game. Ferrell

1932
The fans get their money's worth as Indianapolis outscores Minneapolis,
22-20, to set an American Association record for most runs by both teams.

1934
Babe Ruth draws his 2,000th base on balls at Cleveland, off Oral
Hildebrand. He will retire with a still untopped walk record of 2,056. But
the Indians pound 3 pitchers for 17 hits to win, 13-5.

Although Bob Johnson, Jimmie Foxx and Pinky Higgins hit successive HRs in
the 4th inning, St. Louis Browns P Jack Knott perseveres to beat the A's, 7-4.

Lon Warneke, Cubs mound ace, intentionally walks Gus Mancuso in the 7th
to load the bases and bring up the Giants P Roy Parmelee. After two wild
swings, Tarzan hatchets a high pitch for a grand slam and a 5-3 win.

NL President William Heydler upholds the Cards protest of a loss to the Cubs
on July 2. The game will be resumed from the point at which umpire Klem
waited too long to call an infield fly and be played prior to a scheduled
July 31st game.

1935
Bill Werber of the Red Sox ties the ML record and sets the AL mark with 4
straight doubles in the opening game of a doubleheader with Cleveland. He'll
do it again in 1940 while with the Reds, the only one to accomplish it in
both leagues. The Sox win the pair, 13-5 and 3-1.

In a rowdy game in Cincinnati, the Giants win, 6-3. Reds manager Chuck
Dressen will be fined $50 for "inciting the crowd."

1936
Carl Hubbell starts his 24-game winning streak (spanning two seasons),
beating Pittsburgh 6-0. The Giants hit a NL record tying 4 triples in the
first inning:  Joe Moore, Mel Ott and Hank Leiber hit them in succession,
and Eddie Mayo adds one later in the inning to equal the ML record.
'King Karl' will not be defeated until Memorial Day next season.

Yankees Red Rolfe, Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey hit 3rd-inning HRs against
Detroit to tie the AL record, since topped. New York rolls, 9-4, dropping
the Bengals to 4th place. Goose Goslin has a pair of homers for Detroit.

The LA Times reports that starting pitchers are completing games just half
the time:  in 1312 contests just 541 have finished. 302 CG in the AL and
239 in the NL. Wes Ferrell leads with 15 CG.

1939
Pittsburgh's Chuck Klein makes his 1st appearance in Philadelphia since
leaving the Phils and cracks 2 HRs to lift the Bucs to a 7-4 win.

thumb in the 4th inning against Boston, and the Sox pound relievers to
win the opener, 8-3. Al Benton takes the loss as Bobo leaves with a 3-2
lead. Detroit loses the nitecap, 8-5, and drops into a 2nd place tie with
the Red Sox. Bobo's injury occurs in the 4th when he covers 1st and takes
a throw from Rudy York. The doctor predicts Newsom will be out 4 weeks but
Bobo says 10 days.

Thanks to an AL record-tying 4 errors by Chicago 3B Eric "Boob" McNair,

streak is ended at 56 games (94 hits). Indian pitchers Al Smith and Jim Bagby,

York edges the Indians 4-3, for their 17th win in 18 games to stretch their
lead to 7 games.

At Detroit, Bobo Newsom stops another hitting streak - Cecil Travis' 24
gamer - and stops the Senators, 7-1. Sid Hudson is pounded for the loss.

At Chicago, the other DiMaggio - Dom - cracks a triple and homerun to lead
the Red Sox to a 7-4 win over the White Sox. Another streak is stopped
as starter Thornton Lee is lifted after 16 straight complete games for
Chicago. Herb Newsome is the winner.

The Reds unbeaten Elmer Liddle (11-0) gives up 10 hits to the Giants, but wins
his 11th straight, 5-4. The Reds are in 4th place, 12 games behind Brooklyn.

In a 16-inning 1-1 tie, Hooks Iott of Paragould (Northeast Arkansas) fans
30 against Newport. His 229 strikeouts in 143 innings will earn him a call
up to the Browns in September.

1942
The Browns under Luke Sewell achieve an 8-game win streak with doubleheader
victories, 4-2 and 11-1, over the A's. Chet Laabs blasts HRs in both
games. During the 8-game streak, Laabs hits 7 HRs, including a grand slam
on the 15th. He will finish 2nd to Ted Williams in the AL with 27 HRs.

The Yankees crush the Indians, 8-1, getting a first inning grand slam from
Phil Rizzuto. Red Rolfe also homers.

1947
Less than two weeks after Larry Doby's debut with the Indians, Hank Thompson
and Willard Brown become the second and third black players in the American
League and first for the Browns. The former Kansas City Monarchs standouts
will play in less than 30 games for St. Louis because their presence does
not significantly raise attendance. Hank Thompson plays 2B and goes 0 for
4 in the Browns' 16-2 loss to the A's.

The Yankees sweep a doubleheader against Cleveland, 3-1 and 7-2, to extend
their winning streak to an AL record-tying 19 games. The streak matches

games. Ralph Branca wins the opener as Jackie Robinson clouts a 3-run
homer in the 8th. Paul Minner wins his first ML game in the nitecap with
6 innings of relief. During an argument with Frank Dascoli, Reds catcher
Dewey Williams grabs the ump. Willliams will be fined $100 and suspended
for five games. However, with catcher Ray Mueller on the disabled list with
a broken ankle, the Reds appeal the suspension, stating they have only
one catcher, Ray Lamanno. Ford Frick, NL prexy, will rule that Williams
will serve the suspension in the Reds clubhouse, while dressed in full
uniform. If anything happens to Lamanno, Williams can substitute, and a
game will added to the suspension.

a doubleheader, with the Sox winning the opener, 4-2, on Early Wynn's
homer in the 8th. Vern Stephens breaks a 1-1 tie in game 2 with a solo
homer. Stephens has a 2-run homer in the opener and drives in all 4 Sox runs.

In game 2 in Boston, the Reds' Kent Peterson outpitches Johnny Antonelli
to win 3-2. It is Peterson's first road win in his career after 18 straight
road losses dating back to 1947. This is a ML record to start a career. The
Braves win the opener 5-4 on Ed Sauer's 2-out 9th-inning single.

from Chicago. Still suffering the effects of being shot, Waitkus is headed

the Reds to a 9-8 win over the host Phillies in the first of two. Jocko
Thompson then wins, 10-0, for the Phils.

After pitching for Bill Veeck in Cleveland in 1948, Satchel Paige rejoins
him with the St. Louis Browns. He'll start tomorrow night as the Browns
lose to the Senators, 7-1.

Bob Feller overcomes a 4-run ninth inning to beat the Red Sox, and move
Cleveland a game and a half behind Boston. In the final inning, Feller
surrenders a roundtripper to Lou Boudreau and a pinch homer to Charlie
Maxwell, his first major league homerun.

The White Sox beat the Yankees, 4-3, to move a half game behind the
league-leading Red Sox. But they discover that starting catcher Gus Niarhos
has an arm fracture, sustained in yesterday's marathon game. The Sox call
up former Negro Leaguer Sam Hairston as a catching replacement.

In the 8th inning at New York, with the Cubs ahead 5-0, Hal Jeffcoat of the
Cubs swipes 3B and home on successive pitches. Willie Mays has a two-run homer
in the eighth, but the Cubs win, 7-4. The Jeffcoat steals are ordered by Cubs
manager Frankie Frisch (as noted by Retrosheet from a story in the New York
Times regarding the tension between Frisch and Giants manager Leo Durocher).

1954
With Jim Gilliam (2B), Jackie Robinson (3B), Sandy Amoros (LF), Roy
Campanella (C) and Don Newcombe (P) in the starting lineup against the
Braves, the Dodgers field the first team which consists of a majority of
black players. The historic five helps Brooklyn to beat Milwaukee at County
Stadium, 2-1.

1955
Detroit Tigers first baseman Earl Torgeson steals home with 2 outs in the
9th inning to give the Tigers a 6-5 win over the New York Yankees. The
steal comes with Bob Turley on the mound and the victory gives Detroit a
three-game sweep over New York.

In what would be their most important move of the season, the Brooklyn
Dodgers bring up rookie pitchers Roger Craig and Don Bessent from the minor
leagues. They immediately pay dividends as they beat the Reds in both ends
of a doubleheader. Craig wins, 6-2, and Bessent wins, 8-5.

Vern Law pitches 18 innings, giving up just 9 hits and fanning 12, but gets
no decision as his Pirates beat Milwaukee, 4-3. The win goes to reliever
Bob Friend. This is the longest pitching effort since Les Mueller 10 years
earlier, and no one will match him the rest of this century.

1956
In the 2nd inning in Milwaukee, the Braves' Joe Adcock gets hit as Giants
Ruben Gomez gets him on the wrist. Adcock takes a few steps towards 1B,
shouts at the pitcher, then chases Gomez. The pitcher then fires another
ball, hitting the first baseman on the thigh, before taking off for the
safety of the Giants dugout. Braves 3B coach Johnny Riddle misses a tackle
on Gomez who reaches his teammates, and makes it to the clubhouse where he
finds an ice pick. He is finally wrestled to the floor before he can return
to the field. Both players are tossed by Bill Jackowski, and the NL fines
Adcock $100 and Gomez $250 + a three-game suspension. The last-place Giants
eventually win, 8-6, ending the league-leading Braves' 7-game win streak.

At Cincinnati, Reds pitcher Brooks Lawrence wins his 13th straight, stopping
the Dodgers, 4-3. Lawrence (13-0), who doubles in the 9th and scores the
winning run, has not lost as a Red. He'll sputter now, however, and finish
the season at 19-10. Furillo drives in all 3 runs for the Brooks and Frank
Robinson hits his 20th HR to tie the Reds rookie mark.

Red Sox pitchers Tom Brewer and Bob Porterfield sweep the KC Athletics,
10-0 and 1-0. Williams' homer, his 400th, is the only run in the nitecap
and after hitting it, Ted glares up at the pressbox and makes a motion as
if to spit. Three days later in a game against the Tigers, he'll make the
same gesture and follow through. For Brewer (12-4) it extends his scoreless
streak against KC to 35 innings.

Johnny Kucks wins his 4th game in 10 days - 2 starts and 2 relieves - beating
the Tigers, 4-0. It extends the Yanks' win streak to 11 games and gives
Kucks his 14th win - high in the majors. The Yanks will lose a pair tomorrow.

1957
In front of a House Judiciary subcommittee, team owner Arnold Johnson,
contrary to the truth, denies he has favored the Yankees when trading players
from the A's to the Bronx. The Congress is skeptical due to a number of
recent suspicious deals between the New York and Kansas City clubs.

After losing 12 straight to the Dodgers' Don Newcombe, the Cards end the
righty's domination, beating him, 7-3. Jones is the victor allowing the
Cards to slip back into 1st place. Only 2 games separate the first five
teams. The Cards last beat Newk on August 23, 1951.

1959
In a dispute with the umpires, Cleveland manager Joe Gordon is
ejected. Cleveland OF Minnie Minoso refuses to stand in the batter's box
until the argument is over. Umpire Frank Umont calls him out on strikes. The
enraged Minoso charges Umont and gets the thumb also. The Indians win 8-7
to stay on the heels of Chicago.

Chicago's Early Wynn and the Yankees' Ralph Terry match zeros for 8 innings
at Yankee Stadium, before Chicago's Jim McAnany collects the first Sox hit
in the 9th. Jim Landis adds a 2nd hit to drive home two runs to give the
Sox the 2-0 win. Wynn matched Terry by also allowing just two hits.

1960

10-6 and 8-5, at Busch Stadium.

The Yankees top the O's, 5-0, behind Whitey Ford's 13th straight win. Mantle
(#33) and Skowron hit long HRs at Baltimore. The nitecap goes into the 5th
when, with 2 outs and the Yanks up 4-1, a thunderstorm strikes. The umps
wait 65 minutes before calling the game, thus washing out homers by Maris
and Mantle. Both are ahead of the Bambino's record 1927 pace. The washout
occurs on the same day Commissioner Ford Frick decrees that Babe Ruth's record
of 60 homeruns "cannot be broken unless some batter hits 61 or more within
his club's first 154 games." Two days later, Frick, an old friend of Ruth,
announces that should Ruth's record be beaten after 154 games, the record
will carry an asterisk. When asked about the ruling, Roger Maris replies,
"A season is a season."

1962

to reach the milestone.

Milwaukee 3B Don Money commits a first-inning error in a 10-5 loss to

In Los Angeles, during a 5-4 loss to the Expos, Dodger pitcher Tommy John
blows his elbow out while pitching to Montreal 1B Hal Breeden. Dodger
doctor Frank Jobe will suggest a ligament replacement for the torn ulnar

in a hundred of ever pitching again, John will return after the surgery to

1978
Just prior to the start of the Oriole game at Memorial Stadium, Doc Medich
goes into the stands and saves the life of a 61-year-old fan suffering from

administers a heart massage to the ailing man until medical help arrives.

In the latest incident in his feud with manager Billy Martin, the Yankees'
Reggie Jackson ignores instructions and attempts to bunt in the 10th inning
of a tie game with the Royals. Jackson pops up, the Yanks lose, 9-7, in the

Royals' 3-game sweep at Yankee Stadium leaves New York in 4th place, 14
games behind the Red Sox.

and a triple in their first game.

In the first doubleheader ever played at the Skydome, the Blue Jays sweep
a pair from California, 6-4 and 5-4. Both wins go to David Wells pitching

come until October of 2001.

out for 6 weeks. Mel Stottlemyre Jr makes his ML debut, pitching an inning
of relief against the Bronx Bombers.

the Braves defeat the Cubs, 12-2.

In a 15-inning 9-8 loss to the Royals, DH Sam Horn of the Orioles becomes the
first non-pitcher to strike out 6 consecutive times in a single game. Pitcher
Carl Weilman of the Browns was the only other player to have the dubious
distinction, performing the feat on August 25, 1913. Striking out six times
labels a batter a "Horn," a term Mike Flanagan will coin in the July 29th
"Sports Illustrated."

and breaks a personal 13-game losing streak dating back to September of 1989.

his no-hitter.

The Richmond Braves defeat the Norfolk Tides, 3-2, in 12 innings, in a
Class AAA International League game. The contest is marked by a brawl
in the 8th inning in which both dugouts empty and 1 player is ejected. A
new anti-fighting policy in the minors mandates fines and suspensions for
any player who leaves his position, the dugout, or the bullpen during a
fight. IL president suspends and fines 35 players for their actions.

1996

for the Bengals and is the only pitcher to win back to back MVP awards,
in 1944 and 1945. Following the festivities, the Tigers lose to Milwaukee,
11-7, as the Brewers come up with five runs in the 9th inning.

1998
Both Rafael Palmeiro and Albert Belle hit their 300th homers tonight. Palmeiro
is 3 for 4 as his Orioles win, 4-1, over the Angels, and improve their record

the break - and Robin Ventura's 9th-inning homer give the White Sox a 4-3
victory over the visiting Indians.

The Mariners sink the Royals, 18-5, for their 5th straight win. Bill Swift

doing so on the first ML pitch he sees, only the fourth time in franchise
history the feat has been accomplished.

Braves 1B Rico Brogna announces his retirement, effective immediately,

34th career shutout. Maddux K's 9 and walks none.

Indians P Bartolo Colon is ejected from Cleveland's 10-4 win over Houston

game. After the game Baez goes into the Twins clubhouse to apologize. Thome,
Selby and Broussard homer for the Tribe, while David Ortiz and Dustan Mohr
