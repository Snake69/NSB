1901
At Boston's Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds, Cy Young of the Americans
seven-hits the A's, 5-3, to win his 300th victory. The 34-year-old will win
an additional 211 games to establish an amazing major league record of 511
career victories.

The host Cardinals edge the Giants, 3-2, in 11 innings, beating Mathewson
on an error.

1902
Overcoming poor Buc baserunning, Pirates star Jack Chesbro pitches a
5-hit shutout and strikes out 11 Giants to beat Christy Mathewson, 4-0. As
noted by Clifford Blau, the Buccos lose 5 straight runners via baserunning
errors. With 2 outs in the third, Ginger Beaumont is on 2B, with first base
empty, and he is put out trying to advance to third on a grounder. In the
4th, Hans Wagner leads off with a triple, but is out at the plate on Kitty
Bransfield's grounder to first. Bransfield is then thrown out trying to
steal 2B. Claude Ritchey draws a walk, but is picked off first. Jimmy Burke
leads off the fifth with a double, but tries to stretch it into a triple,
and is tagged out by Matty, covering the bag.

1904
Mathewson wins his 16th, beating the Reds at League Park, 7-4, in 10
innings. Matty triples home a run in the 7th and scores, but the Reds tie
it in the 9th. Noodles Hahn is the loser.

1905
Chicago's Three Finger Brown scores the first of 9 straight wins over Christy
Mathewson, 8-1, as he allows just 2 New York hits. New York's lone run scores
on an error by Billy Maloney. Matty gives up 12 hits while his teammates
commit 5 errors. Of 28 matches over their careers, Brown will win 14.

The Detroit Tigers beat New York, 6-3, with the help of 2 errors by Highlander
1B Jack Doyle. The vet Doyle was signed yesterday and this will be his only
appearance for New York.

At Boston, the Reds score 7 runs in the 6th to beat the Braves, 15-3, in the
first of 2. Rookie Charley Malay hits his only career homer, a 3-run HR,
off Patsy Flaherty. Because of the intense heat, Reds manager Joe Kelley
wants game 2 to be limited to 7 innings, but Boston manager Fred Tenney
insists on 9 ... the Braves win, 3-2. Tomorrow, however, game 2 of the DH
will be postponed till August.

1906
The Reds sell star Cy Seymour to the New York Giants for $12,000. Seymour was
hitting just .257. Reds manager Ned Hanlon claims the move will strengthen
the team, a notion scoffed at in Pittsburgh. The Sporting News surmises,
"Will the lads in Cincinnati stand for the sale of Seymour? Wonder if the
Pittsburgh fans would stand for the sale of Wagner to the Chicago club? Do
you think so, gentle reader?"

1907
After an absence of 24 days, Roger Bresnahan returns to the lineup and
collects 2 hits in a 3-2 win for the Giants against Coakley, the same
hurler who hit him with a pitch on June 18th. Bresnahan does not wear the
headgear he developed. When a fan keeps a foul ball during the game rather
than tossing it back, Giants team secretary Frank Knowles warns that "in
the future he will not be so lenient about anyone stealing a ball."

1909
The Pirates split with the Giants, dropping the opener 3-0 when Christy
Mathewson limits the Bucs to 4 hits. Mathewson (13-2) has won 11
straight. Pittsburgh wins the nitecap 9-0.

1911
In the first inning of a 9-0 win over the Athletics at Detroit, Ty Cobb
walks, then on consecutive pitches steals 2B, 3B and home off lefty Harry
Krause. Twice he beats perfect throws by C Ira Thomas. After Cobb reaches on
a fielder's choice in the 3rd, Sam Crawford homers. In the 7th, Cobb walks,
is bunted to 2B, and scores on a sacrifice fly, knocking the ball out of
the hands of the new catcher Paddy Livingston. This is the 2nd time that
Cobb has had 3 steals in an inning. The other time was July 22, 1909.

Yankee third baseman Roy Hartzell, acquired from the Browns in January for
Jimmy Austin and Frank LaPorte, has a career day as the cleanup hitter. He
hits a 3-run double and another double in one inning, then piles on with a
sacrifice fly and a grand slam, to drive in 8 runs. It is an AL record until
Jimmie Foxx' 9 RBIs in a game in 1933. New York defeats the Browns, 12-2.

At Pittsburgh, the Giants win 4-3 behind Rube Marquard's pitching. Rube
strikes out the side in the 2nd and 3rd innings, setting down Dots Miller,
Newt Hunter and Owen Wilson, then blowing by pitcher Elmer Steele, Bobby
Byrne and Tommy Leach in the 3rd frame.

1912
The Phillies beat the Reds, 6-4, behind Pete Alexander. He'll beat them
again, 5-0, on the 15th.

In Boston, the Red Sox edge the Tigers, 1-0, in 11 innings. Smoky Joe Wood
goes all the way in the win allowing 5 hits and striking out 10.

At Detroit, the Tigers roll over the Athletics and Harry Krause, 9-0. Ty
Cobb swipes home in the 1st inning to start the Tigers off.

In the Yankees' 4-1 win over the Browns, New York pitcher Jack Warhop swipes
home in the 3rd. It is Warhops' 2nd steal of home in 3 years.

1913
Philadelphia's Boardwalk Brown walks 15 Tigers in 7 2/3 innings, but staggers
to a 16-9 win. Brown has only one walkless inning - the first. Ty Cobb, out
for a week with an injured knee, plays 2B for the only time in his career,
and makes three errors in his 5 fielding chances.

1915
At the Polo Grounds, Cincinnati's Gene Dale pitches an 8-hit shutout to
beat the Giants, 6-0. Mathewson takes the loss.

1916
With the temperature at Fenway near 100 degrees, Boston sweeps the White
Sox behind complete game wins by Ernie Shore, 2-1, and Dutch Leonard, 3-1.

1919
Ruth has three hits, including his 11th homer, tying last season's AL record,
to lead the Red Sox to a 12-4 win over the host White Sox. It is the Babe's
first homer at Comiskey ... he has now homered in every AL park in his
career. Babe's HR in the 3rd comes on the first pitch from Dave Danforth,
in relief of Kerr.

1921
In St. Louis, Babe Ruth hits 2 homers including his 137th career HR, passing
19th-century star Roger Connor's record 136. He adds a double as the Yanks
win, 6-4.

1922
Hub Pruett fans Babe Ruth 3 times as the Browns top New York, 7-4. Two
bases-loaded singles in the 8th score 4 runs for the Browns. Tomorrow's
game will be rained out and the Yankees will win on the 14th to stay a half
game back.

The Cleveland Indians defeat the Boston Red Sox, 11-7, with all 20 of the
Indians' hits being singles.

1927
Babe Ruth breaks an 0 for 14 drought by banging his 30th homer of the year
in the 9th. Babe is now a homer ahead of Gehrig. Behind Urban Shocker's
shutout, the Yanks coast to a 7-0 win over the Indians.

Dazzy Vance strikes out 11 batters - 10 in the first 7 frames including 5
in a row - but the Pirates beat Brooklyn, 2-1. Vance also drives home the
only Robin run, but loses to Carmen Hill.

1928
Baseball's biggest battery is recorded, appropriately, with the New York
Giants, as Garland "Gob" Buckeye, a 260-pound pro football lineman in the
off-season, makes his NL pitching debut with 250-pound Shanty Hogan behind
the plate. The Giants lose to the Cardinals. In a significant move, the
Giants purchase 25-year-old lefty Carl Hubbell from Beaumont for an amount
rumored to be the most ever paid for a Texas League player.

1929
The Tigers score 4 runs in the 9th to defeat the Red Sox, 13-12. Gehringer
is hit by a pitch with the bases loaded. Bob Johnson has 4 hits, including
his 2nd HR in 3 days. The two teams combine to use 8 pitchers, and the game
is the longest this year in the majors ... 2 hours 54 minutes.

At Brooklyn, the Cards score 5 in the 9th but the Dodgers come back to plate
6 runs and win, 8-7. They are helped by Card starter Syl Johnson who walks 11
men before exiting in the 9th. The loss goes to Held, who walks two with the
bases loaded as the Cards make three errors in the frame. Johnny Frederick,
who made the only out in the 9th leading off, drives in the winning run with
a single. The Dodgers leave 13 on base today and 14 in their last game. The
Cards score the only runs of the first 7 innings with 2 in the 5th, and as
reported in the New York Evening World, it appears that a dead batch of balls
was used. "An examination of one of the new spheres revealed its cover was
not at all glossy. The rough finish of the balls enabled pitchers Vance and
Johnson to grip them more tightly and thus increase their effectiveness. The
members of the two teams hit several pitched balls solidly, but the balls
did not travel with their customary speed. The first safe hit of the game
was not made until Frederick of the Dodgers singled to right in the third
inning. Infielders had more chances than usual. The new balls were quickly
recognized by the players when carried onto the playing field by Umpire
McLaughlin. They were eagerly examined by members of the St. Louis and
Brooklyn teams before being put into play." (as noted by Retrosheet)

1930
At Navin Field, the league-leading Senators split a pair with the Tigers,
losing the opener, 3-2, and taking the nitecap, 7-5. Joe Judge's homer and
sacrifice fly lead Detroit in the opener with Earl Whitehill picking up the
complete game win. General Crowder takes the loss. The Nats win the nitecap,
overcoming a 4-1 Detroit lead after 5 innings. Joe Cronin and Dave Harris
clout solo homers for Washington, as Bobby Burke is the winner in relief.

The visiting A's score ten runs in the 3rd inning to crush the Browns,
15-7. Jimmie Foxx and Ralph Kress hit homers as the A's bang out 20 hits,
four by Joe Boley. Sam Gray lasts just 2 1/3 innings in taking the loss. Rube
Walberg is given the win, despite pitching just 2 innings. Bill Shores mops
up with seven innings of relief.

The visiting Yankees use a 6-run rally in the 8th inning to beat the White
Sox, 11-6, and gain a split on the day. Chicago wins the opener, 11-7. In
the 2nd game, the Sox score 4 in the 7th, but reliever Red Ruffing stops
the attack. Leading off the 8th inning, Ruffing sails a homer into the RF
stands to start the New York rally. Babe Ruth, his 3 day suspension over,
collects three singles in the two games. The New York Times reports that
"during lulls in the activity, small children raced out into left field to
shake hands with him, provoking the umpires' displeasure." The hitting honors
for the day belong to Chicago's Carl Reynolds with seven hits, including
two doubles and a homer. His three-run homer in the first game occurs when
Harry Rice can't hold his long fly ball, then overthrows 3B. Smead Jolley
adds a homer and a triple in the opener as Chicago unloads ten runs in
three innings to back Ted Lyons' pitching.

1931
The largest crowd in the history of Sportsman's Park in St. Louis - 45,715
(in a ballpark with 35,000 seats) - creates a travesty and permanently
distorts the ML record for doubles hit in a game. Easy fly balls drop for
ground-rule doubles among the fans encroaching on the field. Fans even line
the infield and there is an estimated 8,000 fans on the ball field. There
are 32 doubles hit in 2 games, 11 in the first and 21 in the 2nd, for ML
records both for the most doubles in one game and for a doubleheader. All
told, there were 43 extra base hits recorded. The Cubs take the opener, 7-5,
behind Hack Wilson's 3-run HR, as Jakie May outpitches Bill Hallahan. The
Cards stagger to the finish in the nitecap with a 17-13 win behind Flint
Rhem. Ed Baecht loses for the Cubs.

At New York, the Giants outslug the Phils twice to win, 13-6 and 9-4. Fred
Fitzsimmons coasts in the nitecap as Mel Ott hits 2 homers and drives in 5
runs, and Travis Jackson is 5 for 5. In the opener Bill Terry has 2 triples
and Shanty Hogan 2 homers. Mel Ott collects the 100th homer of his career
... Ott, at 22 years and 4 months, is the youngest player to reach the
century mark. In the AL, Tony Conigliaro, at age 22 years and 6 months,
will reach the plateau on July 23, 1967.

The average runs produced in the games today is 13.6, a total that will
not be topped until April 24, 1996.

1934
Schoolboy Rowe fans 11 Yankees in a 4-2 win that puts the Tigers back in
first place.

Chuck Klein is out of the Cubs' lineup because of injuries as they beat the
Braves, 7-4. He is batting .331 with 19 HRs and 65 RBI, but will miss much
of the 2nd half and never again will return to the high level of performance
previously shown.

1936
At Cincinnati, Phillies starter Joe Bowman gives up his first hit of the
game, a lead off triple in the 9th inning to Kiki Cuyler, and then is
relieved by Claude Passeau, who retires the next 3 batters. The Phils win 4-0.

1937
The last place Phillies score 6 runs in the 7th inning to beat Hal Schumacher
and the Giants, 6-3. With the bases loaded in the first, Giants OF Mel
Ott starts an unusual 9-2-5 triple play. Reds base runners Hersh Martin,
at 2B, and Leo Norris, at 3B, are called out for leaving their bases early,
turning a sacrifice fly into a triple play. The highlight of the game comes
when umpire Bill Klem ejects Giants manager Bill Terry for the first time
in Terry's 15-year career.

1938
Behind Ed Brandt, the Pirates take their 13th straight win, 14-6 over
the Cubs' Tex Carleton. With their 40th victory in their last 54 games,
the Pirates take the NL lead for the first time.

At Brooklyn, the Dodgers beat the Giants, 13-5, but the real beating occurs
in the stands. Dodger fan Robert Joyce is teased by Giants' supporter Frank
Krug about the Dodgers and in retaliation he kills Krug.

Cleveland's Odell Hale hits for the cycle against Washington, but the
Senators win, 9-8.

1940
A single by Dick Siebert in the 8th inning deprives Bob Feller of a no-hitter,
but the Indians ace blanks the A's, 1-0, striking out 13 in a night game. It
is Feller's 4th one-hitter.

1942
In a Western Association twinbill, Joplin and Hutchinson split, with the
Miners winning 12-7, then losing 11-10. Jess Hamm wins game 1 then loses game
2, while Bill Stearkel for Hutchinson loses the opener and wins the nitecap.

1943
In Boston, a team of Armed Forces all-stars managed by Babe Ruth and
featuring Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams plays the Braves in a fund-raising
effort. Ruth pinch-hits in the 7th and flies out to right. The all-stars
win 9-8 on a Williams HR.

1945
The Chicago Cubs stop Tommy Holmes' modern-day NL hitting streak at 37 games,
beating the Boston Braves 6-1 behind Hank Wyse for their 11th victory in a
row. (The mark will stand until Pete Rose surpasses it in 1978.) The Braves
take game two, 3-1, as Claude Passeau loses his first after 9 straight
wins. Holmes hits .433 during the streak and will finish at .352, 2nd in
the NL. His 9 strikeouts coupled with 28 HRs and 47 doubles is unparalleled
for making contact and hitting for average and power.

A's pitchers Bobo Newsom and Jesse Flores toss back to back shutouts over
the Browns, winning 4-0 and 11-0.

1946
Johnny Sain just misses a perfect no-hitter when Grady Hatton's 1st inning
pop fly drops among three Braves behind 3B for a double. No one else gets
on as the Braves win 1-0 in Cincinnati. Ewell Blackwell takes the loss.

Howie Pollet allows 3 hits in beating the Giants, 2-1, in St. Louis in
the first of 2 games. Pollet then comes out of the bullpen in the nightcap
to protect a 5-4 lead in the 9th inning. With runners on 1st and 3rd and
no outs, Pollet gets Mize on a short fly, then gets a DP ground ball. Red
Barrett picks up the win, just his 3rd. Barrett won 23 games in 1945.

1949
The major league owners agree to install warning tracks made of cinder in
front of outfield fences prior to the start of next season. The origin of
the concept is credited to Yankee Stadium where an actual running track,
used in the ballpark's track and field events, helped fielders know their
proximity to the outfield fence when attempting to make a play.

The NL commits 5 errors, allowing the AL to record an 11-7 triumph in the
All-Star Game at Ebbets Field. The contest marks the first appearance of
black players - Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe in the NL
lineup and Larry Doby among the AL stars.

1951
At Cleveland, Allie Reynolds of the NY Yankees faces only 29 batters and
no-hits Cleveland, 1-0, for the first of his two no-hitters this season.
The 'Chief' retires the last seventeen batters to face him, striking out
Bobby Avila to end the game. Gene Woodling's 7th inning HR off loser Bob
Feller is the difference in the 1-0 game. It is the 3rd game in a row that
a Woodling homer has beaten Cleveland. The Chief's no-hitter is the first
by a Yankee since Monte Pearson in 1928. New York takes the nitecap behind
Vic Raschi as Joe DiMaggio cinches it with a three-run homer off Chuck Stobbs.

Paced by a grand slam by Gus Zernial off Dick Starr, the A's outslug the
Browns, 9-7. Zernial's homer gives him 22 to lead the AL; 10 of the homers
have come of St. Louis pitching, and 4 of those are served up by Starr.

The Red Sox and White Sox draw a record crowd of 52,592 for a twi-night
doubleheader at Comiskey Park. Boston wins the opener, 3-2. In the 2nd
game, Saul Rogovin of the White Sox goes the route in a 17-inning contest,
overcoming a two-run HR by Doerr, only to lose 5-4, on Clyde Vollmer's sac
fly. Ellis Kinder of Boston pitches 10 scoreless innings in relief for the
win. The wins move the Red Sox into first place.

1952
In New York, Browns bespectacled backstop Clint Courtney lives up to his
nickname of "Scrap Iron" when he slides hard into New York's Billy Martin in
a 2nd-inning play. In the 6th inning, Courtney tries to knock over Berra in
a play at home, and in the 8th he gets tagged in the face by Billy Martin,
again at second base. Both dugouts empty as he and Martin start fighting
and Courtney is decked. Courtney is the only player ejected, but the AL
hands out a record (since topped) $850 in fines. The Yankees prevail, 5-4,
in 11 innings, as Allie Reynolds goes the distance to beat Satchel Paige.

Bob Lemon stops the A's, 5-1, although Ferris Fain extends his hitting streak
by doubling and scoring in the 9th inning. Lemon does slip a called 3rd strike
past Fain in the 4th, just the 4th K this year for the A's first baseman.

1953
Braves slugger Eddie Mathews hits the first grand slam in the history of the
Milwaukee franchise, as the Braves sweep 2 from the Cardinals, 10-1 and 4-3,
in St. Louis.

visits by American ML clubs to Japan. The program will be sponsored by the
Yomiuri chain alone from 1966.

Baseball Players Association. The Association hires Norman Lewis to negotiate
with the owners and to seek increases in the pension plan.

1955
In the All-Star Game in Milwaukee, the AL takes a 5-run lead on a 3-run shot
by Mickey Mantle off Robin Roberts, only to see the NL tie it. Braves P Gene
Conley strikes out the side in the 12th. Cardinal outfielder Stan Musial
comes to bat leading off the bottom of 12th inning. After Yankee catcher
Yogi Berra complains about his feet hurting, 'The Man' tells him, "Don't
worry, I'll have you home in a minute", then promptly hits a game-winning
homerun off Frank Sullivan of the Red Sox on the next pitch.

1956
Jimmy Piersall puts on a show for a camera crew at Fenway, there to film
a few scenes before the game for his biopic "Fear Strikes Out." When they
finished filming, the crew asks Piersall to hit a homerun, to which he says
he'll try. With the score tied 1-1 in the 9th, and Dick Gernert on 1B,
Jimmy smashes a Jack Harshman pitch into the net in LF to beat Chicago,
3-1. Piersall also robs Lollar of a hit to keep the game tied.

1957
At Jersey City, Gino Cimoli hits a 2-run triple in the 8th on a 3-0 pitch
from Klippstein and the Dodgers win, 3-1. The Reds have lost 7 straight
and Brooklyn replaces them in 4th place.

1958
Orlando Cepeda's 3-run HR off Spahn gives the Giants a 5-3 win and pulls
San Francisco to within a half game of the Braves.

1959
NBC uses outfield TV cameras with 80-inch lenses to show the catchers'
signals during a Yankee-Red Sox game. Announcers Phil Rizzuto and Mel
Allen are invariably correct in calling the signals of Yogi Berra and Sammy
White. Commissioner Ford Frick will request that they halt its use during
future Game of the Week broadcasts. It doesn't help New York, which drops
their last 4 games to the host Red Sox. Boston wins today, 7-3.

Larry Sherry loses his 2nd start for the Dodgers, as the Reds nip him
4-3. Sherry will not lose again, winning his next 7 starts.

1962
For the first time since 1938, when the Waner brothers pulled the trick,

the last of the 9th, and Hank's grand slam provides the winning margin in
an 8-6 Braves win over the Cards.

The Senators send 1B Dale Long to the Yankees for OF Don Lock. Long will
hit .298 in pinstripes this year.

single scores Tim McCarver, as the NL wins 2-1 in 105-degree heat.
Giants hurler Gaylord Perry gets the victory tossing a scoreless ninth and
tenth inning. Brooks Robinson's stellar game (3 hits, 8 chances) earns
him the game MVP. Asked about the new ball park, Casey Stengel remarks,
"It holds the heat well." On-field temperature is 113 degrees.

1967
Reds 3B Tony Perez ends the longest All-Star Game (15 innings, 3 hours 41
minutes) with a HR off Catfish Hunter. HRs by NL 3B Richie Allen and AL 3B
Brooks Robinson account for the other runs in a 2-1 NL triumph.

drives home the lone run. Houston reliever Tom Dukes ties the ML record
with his 9th straight relief appearance for the Astros. Curt Flood has 4
hits for the Birds.

1970
In the second inning of an eventual 7-3 win over the Orioles, the Tigers
lay down a record-tying three sacrifice bunts and score a run on a sac
fly. Detroit muffs the attempts of Cesar Gutierrez and Mickey Lolich to
give themselves up resulting in both players advancing a runner and reaching
first base without making an out.

1972
The A's catcher Dave Duncan is 5 for 5, including a HR, but the Red Sox
win, 7-6. Duncan's counterpart Carlton Fisk is 3 for 3, with a homer and
2 walks. Bill Lee wins in relief.

1974
In Japan, pitcher Naoki Takahashi of Nippon Ham gets a win and save in the
same game (as noted by Gary Garland). Takahashi has a 2-0 count to Clarence
Jones with 2 out in the 6th and a man on 1B. He then goes to 3B and lefty
reliever Nakahara gets Jones to end the inning. In the 7th, Takahashi
takes the mound again and finishes the game, which Nippon Ham wins 2-1,
thus fulfilling the criteria for a save. The rules are later changed so
that this could not happen again.

1975
In a 10-4 loss to Texas, Luis Tiant hits and flies out. He is the 1st Boston
pitcher to hit since the DH was put into effect.

1976
A tentative agreement between the players and owners on labor contracts is
reached. The formal agreement will be announced on August 9th.

1977

Yankees to a 5-2 win over the Brewers. The win stops the Yanks' loss streak
at 3 games.

will be found in Sutter's arm and he will get the week off after the All-Star
break to rest it.

1979
After a delay of a 1 hour 16 minutes, the White Sox are forced to forfeit
the second game of a twi-night doubleheader against the Tigers when over
5000 adolescent fans refuse to leave the field during Disco Demolition
Night. Mike Veeck's promotion involves admitting fans for 98 cents with a
disco record, collecting the vinyl and then literally blowing up the LPs
and .45s in center field. The Tigers win the first game, 4-1.

1987
The Yankees trade P Bob Tewksbury and 2 minor league pitchers to the Cubs
for Steve Trout, who has just pitched back-to-back shutouts.

1988

catcher Terry Steinbach hits a solo homerun (in his first All-Star game
at-bat) and a sacrifice fly to lead the AL to a 2-1 victory at Riverfront
Stadium, and is named the game's MVP. The A's catcher becomes the first
major leaguer to have homered in his first major league at-bat (9/12/86)
and also in the Midsummer Classic.

1989
Ron Guidry retires from baseball. During his 14-year career with the Yankees,
'Louisiana Lightning' compiles a 170-91 record with a 3.29 ERA.

1990
In a six-inning rain-shortened game, White Sox starter Melido Perez no-hits
the hometown Yankees, 8-0. This is the 7th no-hitter this season, the
most since 1917. Lance Johnson makes a diving over-the-shoulder catch in
the 5th to save a hit and also bangs a 3-run HR. Melido's bother Pascual,
who is watching from the New York bench, also hurled an abbreviated no-no,
for the Expos in 1988, holding the Phillies hitless for five innings at
Veterans Stadium.

Barry Bonds hits his 100th career homerun.

1993
Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr becomes the first and only major leaguer

Yards in 1993.

1994
At the Pirates' Three River Stadium, the National League ends its record
six-game Mid Summer Classic slump when Tony Gwynn scores on Moises Alou's
double in the tenth inning giving the Senior Circuit an 8-7 victory. Fred
McGriff is named MVP, earning the honor with his dramatic two-run homerun
off Lee Smith that tied the game in the bottom of the ninth. The NL is now
a perfect 9-0 in extra-inning contests. Houston P John Hudek becomes the
1st P in history to appear in an All-Star Game before recording a major
league victory.

1995
Montreal defeats the Cubs by a score of 3-2. Throughout the game, Expo 1B
David Segui shares his mitt with Chicago's Mark Grace as Grace's glove did
not arrive at the ballpark due to a shipping mix-up. The player's leave
the mitt in the field between innings, as players did until the mid-50s.

1996
Down 9-2 as they bat in the last half of the 7th inning in Colorado, the
Rockies score 11 times and hold on for a 13-12 win over the Padres. 3B
Vinny Castilla's grand slam - his 2nd homer of the game - is the big blow
of the inning.

Minnesota star Kirby Puckett announces he is retiring, effective immediately,
because of glaucoma in his right eye.

1997
Pitching for the first time in Fenway not wearing a Red Sox uniform, Roger
Clemens strikes out sixteen in 8 innings as the Blue Jays defeat Boston,
3-1. During the game, it appears the 'Rocket' is continually glaring up at
Dan Duquette in the general manager's suite. Boston pitchers K 13 Seattle
batters as the total of 29 strike outs falls one short of the major league
mark for two teams in a single game.

In Pittsburgh's 1st non-Opening Day sellout since 1977, a crowd of 44,119 sees
Francisco Cordova and Ricardo Rincon combine on a 10-inning no-hitter as the
Pirates down the Astros, 3-0, on a 10th-inning pinch HR by Mark Smith (the
first extra-inning combined no-hitter in big league history). Cordova hurls
the 1st 9 innings while Rincon hurls the 10th and gets the win. The victory
keeps the Pirates in a tie for 1st place with the Astros in the NL Central.

1998
Mark McGwire becomes the second player to hit 40 homeruns in both leagues. The
Cardinals' first baseman, who accomplished the feat three times with the A's,
joins Darrell Evans who hit 41 with the Braves (1973) and 40 with the Tigers
(1985).

2000
In a six-player deal, the Reds trade Denny Neagle (8-2, 3.52) and outfielder
Mike Frank to the Yankees for minor league third baseman Drew Henson,
outfielder Jackson Melian and pitchers Brian Reith and Ed Yarnall.

The Phillies trade hurler Andy Ashby to the Braves for pitcher Bruce Chen
and Jimmy Osting. Atlanta gets the better of the the mid-season deal when
Ashby wins eight games for his new club compared to only three victories
posted by Chen and none for Osting, who will never make the parent club.
Chen, who made 22 appearances for the Braves this year, all in relief, will
make 15 appearances for the Phils - all starts (as noted by Wayne McElreavy).

2001
Three Minnesota players homer twice in the Twins' 13-5 defeat of
Milwaukee. Jacque Jones, Torii Hunter and Corey Koskie each hit a pair of
four-baggers to tie a ML record.

Mark McGwire hits his 563rd homer to tie Reggie Jackson for sixth on
baseball's career list in a 7-5 loss to the Tigers. It is also McGwire's
200th homer since joining the Cardinals at the trade deadline in 1997,
making him the third player in history to hit 200 homers in both leagues.

2003
The White Sox defeat the Indians, 7-4, in 10 innings, in the 1st game of
a day-night doubleheader. Paul Konerko's 3-run HR is the winning blow. Tom
Gordon gets the save for Chicago, becoming the 14th pitcher in history to
notch at least 100 career wins and 100 saves.

The Giants beat the Diamondbacks, 8-1. Barry Bonds hits his 30th HR of the
year to join Jimmie Foxx as the only players with 12 straight 30-HR seasons.

2005
At the Home Run Derby in Detroit, Bobby Abreu shatters the records for a
single round, the championship round and the grand total for all three rounds
of the derby by hitting 41 dingers into every part of Comerica Park. The
Phillies outfielder, who was representing Venezuela in the event's new
international format, goes deep 24 times in the first round, tacks on six
more in the second round and finishes with 11 more in the championship round.

During the All-Star game Town Hall discussion, Bud Selig, believing the
designated hitter is a big part of the game, states the rule will remain in
use for the foreseeable future. The commissioner however makes it clear the
National League will never adopt the 1973 addition to the American League
rule book.

The American League downs the National League, 7-5, in the All-Star Game in
Detroit. Miguel Tejada is named the game's MVP. It is the AL's 8th straight
win. Tejada homers off John Smoltz to start the scoring. Mark Teixeira adds
a 2-run drive off Dontrelle Willis.

2006
The offensively-challenged Astros obtain Aubrey Huff from the Devil Rays
in exchange for two minor league prospects, RHP Mitch Talbot and infielder
Ben Zobrist as well as cash. The team hopes the 30-year-old third baseman
can provide some pop in the Houston lineup, which is tied for the worst
batting average in the league.

2008
At 42 years and 89 days Greg Maddux becomes the oldest pitcher in big league
history to steal a base as San Diego loses to Atlanta. Jim Kaat had the
previous mark. It is Maddux' 11th SB of his career.

2009
The Red Sox dedicate the center-field flagpole to Dom DiMaggio by raising
a banner just below the stars and stripes with the former center fielder's
name on it. After the ceremony, his widow, Emily, throws out the ceremonial
first pitch prior to the Fenway Park contest against Kansas City. Josh
Beckett wins his 100th game.

2011
Prince Fielder hits a 3-run homer as Roy Halladay and his relievers combine
on a 6-hitter to lead the NL over the AL, 5-1, giving the senior circuit
its first 2-game winning streak in the All-Star game since the mid-1990s.

A half-hour after the Mid-summer Classic is completed, the Mets send former
All-Star reliever Francisco Rodriguez and cash to the Brewers for two players
to be named later. K-Rod, an outstanding closer for the Mets and Angels,
will be used primarly as a set-up man for Milwaukee's John Axford.
