is named the Series MVP for the Twins, who win all 4 games in the Metrodome
while losing all 3 in Atlanta. Four of the 7 games are decided on the final
pitch, while 5 are decided by a single run, and 3 in extra innings. All
are Series records. Morris' 10-inning masterpiece is the last extra-inning

and led to much of the labor unrest in the national pastime.

1999

overall world championship. Roger Clemens gets the win, hurling 4-hit ball
before leaving the game in the 8th inning. Mariano Rivera gets the save, his

kids, Andrew and Caroline, to miss classes in the past to watch the Bronx
Bombers' post-season celebrations.

City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's invitation to be part of the parade for the

the feat for the Pirates. Troy Glaus is named Series MVP.

2003
The Red Sox announce that manager Grady Little's contract will not be renewed
for 2004. They also say it has nothing to do with Little's decision to stay
with Pedro Martinez in game 7 of the ALCS. They also ask the question:  "What
do Grady Little and Don Zimmer have in common? Neither could take out Pedro."

2004
Under the moon's reddish tint caused by a lunar eclipse, the Red Sox exorcised
86 years of agonizing losses by winning their first World Series since
1918. In one of the most dominating Fall Classic performances, Boston,
who never trailed during the four games, blanks the Cardinals, 3-0, to
complete the sweep. Derek Lowe gets the win. Johnny Damon hits a HR for
the Sox. Manny Ramirez (.412 BA, 4 RBIs) is voted Series MVP.

was quitting his day job as a broker's assistant, but hadn't decided what
to do with the windfall.

2006
At the new Busch Stadium, the Cardinals beat the heavily favored Tigers,
4-2, in game 5 of the Fall Classic to win their first world championship

of RBIs from Series MVP David Eckstein. Sean Casey homers for Detroit.

with a year left on his contract, leaves San Diego, to become the manager of

a 951-975 (.494) record during his 12 seasons in the Friars dugout, signs
a three-year deal worth approximately $6 million.

2007
In the first Fall Classic game ever played in Colorado, Daisuke Matsuzaka
becomes the first Japanese starting pitcher in World Series history, allowing
2 runs on 3 hits in 5 1/3 innings, to get the win against the Rockies in the
10-5 Red Sox game-3 victory. After paying $51.1 million for the rights to
negotiate with the right-hander, Boston obtained 'Dice-K' from the Seibu Lions
signing the World Baseball Classic MVP to a 6-year deal worth $52 million.

2008
After playing in drenching steady rain until the middle of the sixth inning
at Citizens Bank Park, game 5 of the World Series is suspended making it the

away from a world championship, will resume tomorrow at the point the rain
delay stopped play.

2009
General manager Ed Wade announces Brad Mills has agreed to a two-year
contract, with a team option for the third, to become the Astros manager,
replacing Dave Clark who served as interim manager when Cecil Cooper was fired

Francona's bench coach with the Red Sox, has never managed in the majors, but
spent 11 seasons as a minor league skipper with the Cubs, Rockies and Dodgers.

2013
The San Diego State University baseball team continues their tradition
in which every player dons a costume during a late-October intra-squad

Bobsled Team, social media apps, a Leprechaun, as well as Captain America
and Captain Underwear.

The Red Sox win the first World Series game to ever end on a pickoff,
beating the Cardinals, 4-2, in Game 4 of the Fall Classic. Kolten Wong,

base by Boston closer Koji Uehara, ending the Busch Stadium contest with
the dangerous Carlos Beltran at the plate.

Michael Conforto becomes the third player to accomplish the World Series
Triple Crown, playing in the Little League World Series (2004 Redmond LL,

event are Jason Varitek (1984 Altamonte Springs LL, FL, 1994 Georgia Tech,
and the 2004 Red Sox) and Ed Vosberg (1973 Tucson LL, AZ, 1980 University
of Arizona, and the 1997 Marlins).
