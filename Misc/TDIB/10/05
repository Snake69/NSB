Oct 5

1901
The Brooklyn Superbas sweep two from the Giants, 8-0 and 4-2. Wild Bill
Donovan pitches the opener, allowing 3 hits, in winning his NL-high 25th
game. Christy Mathewson umpires the first game, then loses the 2nd game,
also umpired by a ball player.

1905
Athletics P Chief Bender has 3 hits, including a triple with 3 on, in an 8-0
victory over Washington. He relieves Andy Coakley in the 2nd game and wins,
9-7. Overall, he has 2 wins, 6 hits and 8 RBIs for the day.

Trying for his 32nd win, Mathewson is beaten, 4-1, by the Phillies. New
York takes the nitecap, 5-3.

1906
The Giants give Christy Mathewson's brother Henry a starting chance against
Boston and he promptly puts his name in the record books. Henry establishes
a modern NL record by walking 14. He also hits one batter, allows just 5
hits, but completes the 7-1 loss. He'll pitch another inning next year,
but this is his only ML decision. Big Jeff Pfeffer is the winner, but he
still finishes 13-22. He combines with Young, Lindeman and Dorner as four
20-game losers, matching the ML record set last year by Boston. Irv Young
is the only repeater from last year's staff.

1907
In the last game of the year for the Athletics, Rube Vickers hurls a 5-inning
4-0 perfect game against Washington. He also wins the 15-inning first game of
the twin bill, 4-2, with a spectacular 12-inning relief effort, allowing 8
hits. The two wins are the only ones for Vickers this year. Starter Charlie
Fritz falters after three innings and Rube Waddell tosses just one pitch,
hit for a single. It is Waddell's last pitch for the A's as Mack will pedal
Rube to the Browns over the winter.

In St Louis, the Tigers clinch the AL pennant with a 10-2 win over the
Browns. Ty Cobb's triple in the 4th starts the scoring and he adds a homerun
in his other official at-bat.

In the first of two games, the Cubs, leading the Cardinals, 2-0, in the 4th,
find themselves on the losing end of an argument with umpire Rigler, who calls
Evers out at 3B. After a number of Cubs squawk at the call, Rigler orders
them to their positions and then forfeits the game to the Cardinals. With
that, Chance, Pfester and Overall leave the park and head over to watch
the Series-bound Tigers play the Browns. The Cards take game 2, 4-3.

In Philadelphia, the Phillies complete a three-game sweep by winning a pair
from the Giants, 7-3 and 3-2. Rookie George McQuillan (4-0) beats Christy
Mathewson in game two, called after the Giants bat in the 7th. Mathewson
finishes the season at 24-12.

1908
Ed Walsh of the White Sox tops Detroit, 6-1, for his 40th victory and
forces the AL pennant race to the final day. Detroit's 24-game winner Eddie
Summers takes the loss. Walsh leads the league in games (66), IP (464), K's
(269), complete games (42), saves (6), shutouts (11) and winning percentage
(.727). His ERA is 1.42. Big Ed's win total remains a White Sox single-season
record. Walsh, a right-hander from Meriden, CT, will finish his 14-year
Hall of Fame career with a 195-126 record and sets the all-time ERA mark
with a earned run average 1.82.

The Browns end the Naps' pennant hopes with a 3-1 win in the opener of
two. Cleveland takes the 2nd game, 5-3, to end the season with a 90-64
record. If the Tigers win tomorrow, their 90-63 will top Cleveland, whereas
if the White Sox win, their 89-63 record will be 4 points ahead of the Naps.

Boston's King Brady makes his only AL appearance a good one, shutting out
the Highlanders, 4-0. King had fashioned 1-1 records for both the Phillies
and Pirates in the NL, and will go back to the NL with Boston over the
winter. Today's shutout comes in Brady's last ML start.

1910
Connie Mack inserts his son Earle behind the plate in a game against the
Highlanders. Earle, who hit .135 in 26 minor league games this year, responds
with a single and a triple while catching Eddie Plank and Jack Coombs. The
Highlanders beat the A's, 7-4. Earle will mop up in late season games next
year and again in 1914, and serve for 25 years as his father's coach.

1911
The National Commission sells motion picture rights to the WS for $3,500. When
the players demand a share of it, the Commission cancels the deal.

1912
The Red Sox defeat the A's, 3-0, for their 105th win of the season, an AL
record until the 1927 Yankees reach 110. Buck O'Brien (20-13) is the victor.

In their last game at Washington Park, the Superbas lose to the Giants,
1-0. Pat Ragan takes the loss before 10,000 fans. Brooklyn will open next
season at Ebbets Field.

The Yankees also play their last game at their field, Hilltop Park,
beating the Senators, 8-6, on the strength of Hal Chase's 3-run HR in the
8th and another homer by Jack Lelivelt. The win is the first in 10 games
for last-place New York (50-102). Next year the team will play at the Polo
Grounds. Homer Thompson, in his only game in the majors, is behind the
plate for New York, though he does not make a plate appearance; the last
of 4 hurlers is his brother Tommy, making them the first brother battery
in AL history. Coach Nick Altrock, in his first appearance in 3 years,
is the losing pitcher.

Cubs manager Frank Chance sells his 10% share in the Cubs to Harry Ackerland
of Pittsburgh. The 100 shares are worth $40,000.

1914
At Fenway Park, Washington's Walter Johnson wins his 28th game of the year,
a 9-3 win over the Sox. Babe Ruth, pinch hitting for pitcher Ray Collins,
strikes out on three pitches.

In game 2 of a twinbill with the Braves, Dodger P Pat Ragan relieves in
the 8th inning and strikes out the side on 9 pitches, doffing his hat to
the home crowd after each K. He's the first National Leaguer to do it. The
celebration is a bit premature as the Braves score 5 runs off Ragan in the
9th to win, 9-5. Boston wins the opener, 15-2.

1915
In a 5-0 loss to the Indians, Detroit speedster Ty Cobb steals his 96th
base. Cobb's 96 steals will stand as the record until 1962 when Maury Wills
steals 104 bases.

1916
With the Braves ahead, 4-1, in the 8th inning, Phils manager Pat Moran
puts pudgy Billy Maharg in as a pinch hitter. Maharg grounds out and then
plays LF before returning to his real duties as chauffeur for Phils C Bill
Killefer. Maharg also appeared in 2 innings as a replacement Tiger in 1912.

1918
Giant infielder Eddie Grant is killed in action in the Argonne forest
in France.

1920
Before the start of the WS, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets gives his approval
for the addition of rookie Joe Sewell to the Indians' roster. Sewell joined
the team after September 1st and was not eligible for the series. The
tradition of low-scoring WS games continues when the Indians manage to
collect only 5 hits off Brooklyn's Rube Marquard (10-7) and 2 relievers. Stan
Coveleski's (24-14) 5-hitter gives the Indians a 3-1 opening win.

1921
In the first one-city WS since 1906, the Polo Grounds will be the site for
all 9 games. Carl Mays (27-9) is at his best, needing 86 pitches to set the
Giants down with 5 hits - 4 of them by Frank Frisch. Ruth drives in the first
run of the Series in the opening inning of this 3-0 Yankee win. Mike McNally,
subbing for Frank Baker at 3B, steals home in the 5th while Phil Douglas
(15-10) is winding up. The game is broadcast on KDKA radio (the 1st radio
broadcast of any WS game), with Grantland Rice announcing. It is the only
game of the season's WS to be aired.

1922
Bob Shawkey (20-12) goes the route with the Giants scoring 3 in the first
and the Yanks getting single tallies in the first, 4th and 8th. A near-riot
erupts among the 36,514 fans when umpire George Hildebrand, acting on
umpire Bill Klem's advice, calls the game a 3-3 tie due to darkness after
10 innings. The fans think there's light enough to continue. It takes a
police escort to get Judge Landis out of the park and away from the unruly
mob. That night he bends over backwards to negate the public's opinion that
the game might have been called to provide an extra day's gate by donating
the $120,554 receipts to charities. Half will go to New York charities,
and half to disabled soldiers.

1923
In his season finale, Walter Johnson K's 12 Red Sox to win his 17th,
4-2. The 12 strikeouts are the highest in the majors this year and boosts
Johnson's total to an AL-high 130.

1924
A 2-run HR in the first by Goose Goslin and a solo blast by manager Bucky
Harris in the 5th give Tom Zachary (15-9) a 3-0 lead. The Giants tie it
in the 9th, but a double by Roger Peckinpaugh scores Joe Judge with the
winning run in the bottom of the 9th.

1926
Jesse Haines (13-4) stifles the Yanks on 5 hits while the Cards kayo Dutch
Ruether (14-9 on the year, 2-5 for the Yanks) in the 5th. Haines helps his
own side with a 2-run HR in the 4th. The 4-0 St. Louis win gives them the
Series lead.

1927
With 158 HRs, a .307 team BA, and 6 winning pitchers, the Yanks are the Series
favorite. But the Pirates are no slouches with a team BA of .305. OF Kiki
Cuyler, a .309 hitter, will see no action in the Series, being passed over
for a lighter-hitting OF, as he and manager Donie Bush feud. Pittsburgh's
Ray Kremer (19-8) opens the WS against Waite Hoyt (22-7). In the 3rd, 2
walks and 2 Pirate errors help the Yankees to 3 runs and a 4-1 lead. With
9 hits, the Pirates come close, but the final is 5-4 New York.

1928
Grover Alexander (16-9) faces George Pipgras (24-13) in game 2. Gehrig
unloads a 3-run HR in the first. The Cards tie in the 2nd, but Pipgras shuts
them out on 2 hits the rest of the way. Alexander is nicked for one in the
2nd and is driven to cover by a 4-run outburst in the 3rd and it's 9-3 New
York. Ruth is 2 for 3, and Gehrig has 3 more RBIs.

1929
Mel Ott and Chuck Klein go into today's Giant-Phils doubleheader tied at 42
homeruns apiece. In the opener, a 5-4 Phils victory, Ott manages a single,
but Klein homers off Carl Hubbell in his first at-bat to take the HR lead. In
game 2, Ott singles in his first at-bat. After that, manager Burt Shotton
orders the Phillies pitchers, rather than give Ott a chance to tie Klein,
to semi-intentionally walk him 5 times. The last (semi) intentional walk
comes on a 3-2 count with the bases loaded as the Giants win, 12-3. Phillie
Lefty O'Doul gets 6 hits in the 2 games for an NL record of 254 hits for
the season. In the 5th inning of game 1, Lefty's 3rd hit of the game,
a 5th-inning HR, is his 251st of the year. He has a 4th hit in game one,
then two more in the nitecap. Klein follows O'Doul's HR with one of his own,
his 43rd. For Rogers Hornsby, it was a tough inning, as the two HRs eclipse
two of his NL season records: most hits (250) and most HRs (42). Each player
connects in all National League parks, the first players not named Ruth to
accomplish the feat.

In Cincinnati, Reds righthander Rube Ehrhardt, making his only start of
the year, becomes one of only five men to pitch a shutout in their final ML
game. He blanks the Cubs, 9-0, on 5 hits for his only win of the year. Mike
Cvengros is the loser.

1930
Jesse Haines pitches a brilliant 4-hitter to beat Lefty Grove and the A's,
3-1, thereby evening up the Series.

1931
Because of a Pennsylvania law banning baseball on Sunday, an extra day is
added as the Series moves to Philadelphia. Lefty Grove pitches the 3rd game
with 3 days rest. However, Burleigh Grimes, who had lost twice to Grove
in 1930, has a no-hitter until the 8th inning, winning 5-2. Pepper Martin
continues to excite the crowds with 2 more hits, scoring twice.

1933
The WS moves to Washington, and Earl Whitehill blanks the Giants,
4-0. President Roosevelt throws out the first ball and stays for the whole
game despite a steady rainfall.

1934
With no need for a travel delay, the teams move to St. Louis, and Paul
Dean puts the Cardinals ahead with a 4-1 win. He pitches shutout ball until
the 9th.

1935
Detroit's Al Crowder outduels Tex Carleton, 2-1, when the Cubs allow an
unearned run in the 6th.

1936
The Giants score 3 in the first on five hits, then stave off a final Yankee
victory with a 5-4 win for Hal Schumacher in 10 innings.

The 7th-place Brooklyn Dodgers fire manager Casey Stengel with a year
remaining on his contract. Burleigh Grimes is seen as the likely heir.

1938
Bill Dickey ties a WS record with 4 hits, as Red Ruffing pitches the Yankees
to a 3-1 win in the Series opener at Wrigley Field.

1939
In game 2 of the World Series, Yankees P Monte Pearson does not allow a
base hit until one out in the 8th when Ernie Lombardi singles. The Reds
are shut out, 4-0. Babe Dahlgren hits a HR and a double off losing pitcher
Bucky Walters.

1940
Paul Derringer, who had lost 4 WS starts going back to 1931, finally breaks
his jinx. His 5-hitter and Jim Ripple's 3rd-inning double, which knocks
Dizzy Trout from the mound, provide a 5-2 win.

1941
With 2 out in the 9th inning, Dodger C Mickey Owen drops a 3rd strike
on Tommy Henrich, which would have given Brooklyn a 4-3 victory over New
York. The Yankees then rally for a 7-4 win in the 4th game of the WS. Keller
has 2 singles and 2 doubles to lead Yanks.

The White Sox top the Cubs, 6-0, to sweep the 3-game Windy City series. The
Cubs have lost 11 straight series to the Southsiders.

The attraction of Bob Feller versus Satchel Paige draws a crowd of 10,136
to Sportsman's Park as the Miguel Gonzalez All-Stars play the Kansas City
Monarchs. The two aces retire half way through, with Feller ahead 4-1. Frank
Crespi and Johnny Lucadello have the hits to drive in the runs off Paige. The
final is 5-1 with Al Barlick umping.

1942
Whitey Kurowski's 2-run HR in the 9th inning gives St. Louis a 4-2 WS triumph
and enables the Cardinals to upset the New York Yankees in 5 games. Rookie
Johnny Beazley is this game's winning pitcher.

1943
Many ML players have gone into the war, including several key Yankees and
Cardinals players. Nevertheless, both these clubs are back in the Series. New
York wins the opener at Yankee Stadium, 4-2, behind Spud Chandler, who will
later be named the AL MVP. Joe Gordon homers off Max Lanier.

1944
Ken O'Dea's pinch single in the 11th drives in Ray Sanders for a Cardinals
3-2 win. Two errors by Potter and one by Mark Christman give the Cards 2
early-inning unearned runs.

1945
Claude Passeau of the Chicago Cubs pitches a one-hitter, beating the Detroit
Tigers, 3-0, in the 3rd game of the WS. Rudy York's 2nd-inning single spoils
Passeau's bid for immortality. Bill Nicholson drives in the first run.

1947
Al Gionfriddo, inserted in left field for defensive purposes, makes one of
most historic catches in World Series history when he robs Joe DiMaggio of an
extra base hit with two men on base in the sixth inning. The outfielder's
heroics help to preserve an 8-6 Dodger victory in game 6 of the Fall
Classic. There is another WS attendance record, with a crowd of 74,065 on
hand to watch the game.

1949
In the Series opener at the Stadium, the New York Yankees and Allie Reynolds
beat the Brooklyn Dodgers 1-0 on Tommy Henrich's 9th-inning HR off Don
Newcombe. Newcombe had struck out 11 and walked none before Henrich's
blast. Allie Reynolds gives up only 2 hits and fans 9. Henrich's hit is
the first game-ending homer is WS history ... there will be 10 more this
century, including 2 that win the Series. Reynolds pitches a complete-game
win. It is Casey Stengel's first postseason victory.

1950
Allie Reynolds and the Yankees win again over ace Robin Roberts, 2-1 in 10
innings, in Philadelphia. Joe DiMaggio's leadoff HR in the 10th inning is
the game winner.

1951
The Yanks and Eddie Lopat even up the WS by winning, 3-1, over Larry
Jansen. Lopat scatters 5 hits, three by Monte Irvin. Irvin has now hit
safely 7 straight times in two games. Mickey Mantle is injured in the 5th
inning when he steps on an exposed water sprinkler while chasing a Willie
Mays fly ball. Mantle is taken off the field on a stretcher and the injury
to his knee will plague him throughout his career. He will undergo the
first of 6 knee operations. Joe DiMaggio's abrupt call for the fly ball
leads many to believe the last minute call was a contributing factor to
the torn cartilage suffered by the 19-year-old rookie.

In a fine pickup, the Reds send OF Bobby Usher and C Johnny Pramesa to the
Cubs for OF Bob Borkowski and C Smoky Burgess.

S. Iijima of the Daiei Stars (later the Lotte Orions) gets 11 RBIs in a
single game for a Japanese record. The U.S. ML record is 12, set by Jim
Bottomley of St. Louis in 1924. Iijima ties Tony Lazzeri of the NY Yankees
who knocked in 11 in 1936.

1952
At Yankee Stadium, the seesaw WS battle continues as Brooklyn wins, 6-5 in
11 innings, when Duke Snider doubles home Billy Cox. Carl Erskine goes all
the way for the win.

1953
At Yankee Stadium, the Yanks end the WS in 6 as Billy Martin's 12th WS hit,
a record-breaking single to CF in the bottom of the 9th for a 4-3 walkoff
win, gives the Yankees their 5th championship in a row. Carl Furillo had
tied it up in the 9th with a 2-run HR.

1956
The Dodgers come back from a 6-0 deficit in game 2 to win, 13-8, behind
the sterling relief pitching of Don Bessent. Yankee C Yogi Berra becomes
the first player in WS history to hit a grand slam in a losing cause as he
sends one over the RF screen off Don Newcombe in the 2nd.

Owner Clark Griffith of the Senators says the club is considering moving
to the West Coast because of the delay in building a new Washington stadium.

1957
In the first World Series game ever played in Milwaukee, the Yankees score 5
in the 7th to cap a 12-3 win, as Don Larsen, in relief of Bob Turley, defeats
Bob Buhl. The win puts the Bronx Bombers ahead two games to one in the Fall
classic. Tony Kubek becomes the second rookie to hit two round-trippers in
a Fall Classic game, a feat first accomplished by Charlie Keller, who hit
a pair of homers in game 3 in 1939.

1958
Milwaukee goes up 3 games to one with a 3-0 2-hit shutout by Warren Spahn,
who allows just 2 hits. The Braves stop Hank Bauer's 17-game WS hitting
streak, dating back to 1956.

1959
In game 4, the Dodgers edge the White Sox, 5-4, as Larry Sherry wins in
relief of Roger Craig. The Sox tie the game at 4-4 after spotting the
Dodgers a 4-0 lead. The previous day's record-crowd is bested by today's
attendance of 92,650.

1960
In a portent of things to come, Bill Mazeroski's 2-run 5th-inning HR off Jim
Coates is the difference as Pittsburgh beats New York, 6-4, in its first
WS win since 1925. Roy Face survives a 2-run 9th-inning Elston Howard HR
to preserve Vern Law's victory.

1961
Joey Jay's 4-hitter, Gordy Coleman's 2-run HR, and 2 RBI-hits by Johnny
Edwards lead Cincinnati to a 6-2 win and even the WS.

Green and IF Jim Mahoney. Donovan will respond with 20 wins and lead the
AL in shutouts with 5.

1962
Jack Sanford's 3-hitter handcuffs New York and knots the WS. Matty Alou's RBI
grounder and Willie McCovey's HR off Ralph Terry account for San Francisco's
2-0 win.

between Don Drysdale and Jim Bouton. A first-inning run is all Los Angeles
needs to take a 3-0 WS lead.

for LA. Bake McBride's homer in the 3rd is the only score for Philley.
Glenn Burke greets Baker on the dugout steps to congratulate his Dodger

will collect 230 hits and score 133 runs for the division winning club.

Brewers outfielder Ben Ogilvie becomes the first non-American born player
to lead the American League in homeruns. On the last day of the season,

Junior Circuit.

Capping an improbable comeback, the Dodgers beat the Astros for the 3rd day
in a row to force a one-game playoff for the NL West title. Ron Cey hits a

in the 8th. Cordero adds a single in the 9th. Halladay lost a no-hitter in
1999 when he gave up a 2-out 9th-inning HR to Bobby Higginson in his first

earlier in the year, following his 10.64 ERA in 2000, the worst in ML history

Miller Park, 5-0. The Diamondback victory clinches a tie for the NL West
flag and with the win, the 30-year-old right-hander avoids becoming the
