hits and two steals. The attendance in Pittsburgh is 11,556.

1904
Despite a 154-game schedule (the season will be extended to 162 games in
1961), Detroit OF Jimmy Barrett becomes the first to play in 162 games, as
the 7th-place Tigers close their home season, splitting with the Cleveland
Blues before 400 spectators. The Tigers set a season record with 10 tie
games, 8 of which are replayed.

In a 7-inning nitecap, called on account of darkness, the Reds' Miller
Huggins lashes three triples against the Cardinals. The Reds win, 8-1. They
also win the opener, 6-0.

1905
A Pacific Coast League game between the Oakland Oaks and Portland Beavers
is attended by one fan. According to newspaper reports, the home-plate
umpire, whose job it is to announce lineups, addresses the crowd, "Dear
sir ...". Portland wins, 3-2.

1907
The Tigers have game one of the World Series against the Cubs in their grasp
- or in C Charlie Schmidt's glove - but it gets away from them. Leading
3-2 in the 9th, Bill Donovan faces pinch hitter Del Howard with 2 on and
2 outs. He fans Howard, but the ball gets away from Schmidt, and the tying
run scores. Darkness ends the game after 12 innings.

1908
According to published reports, nearly 250,000 fans show up at the Polo
Grounds to watch the disputed replay of the September 23 "The Merkle Boner"
game between the Cubs and Giants. The gates were closed at 1:30 for the
3:00 game, but still fans tried to storm the gates. Fireman with high
pressure hoses knocked down fans that tried to scale the walls. Nearly
40,000 fans watched from Coogan's Bluff, telephone poles and other vantage
points. Two fans are killed when they fall from a pillar on the elevated
subway platform. Later admitting he had nothing on the ball, Mathewson loses,
4-2, to the Cubs, giving way to Hooks Wiltse in the 8th. Three Finger Brown,
relieving Jack Pfiester in the first, gets the win. The Giants played to a
record 910,000 in attendance for the year, a figure that will be unmatched
until 1920. The Cubs win the National League pennant by one game over the
Giants in one of the most dramatic pennant races of all time.

1909
The Pirates, winners of 110 games, face Detroit in the WS, which pits the 2
leagues' top offensive stars, Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb. It is the first of
three times that batting champs will face each other in the WS (Al Simmons
and Chick Hafey in 1931, Bobby Avila and Willie Mays in 1954). Pittsburgh
manager Fred Clarke starts 27-year-old rookie righthander Babe Adams against
Tigers P George Mullin. There are only 11 hits in the game, but one is a
HR by Clarke, and the Pirates win, 4-1, before a crowd of 29,264.

1910
The Superbas tip the Giants, 3-2 in 10 innings, when reliever Red Ames
wild-pitches in the winning Brooklyn run.

The Yankees beat Boston twice, winning 4-1 and 6-5. The first game takes
72 minutes.

With the White Sox putting lefty Irv Young on the mound against the Tigers,
Cobb takes the night train to Philadelphia and manager Hugh Jennings leaves
for home. Wild Bill Donovan manages the Tigers. Young allows 3 hits in
taming the Tigers, 4-0, his 4th win of the year and 4th shutout. He adds
a RBI single, steals second and when neither the second baseman nor the
shortstop move to cover the base, the throw sails into CF, and Young sails
to 3B. He then scores the 4th run.

1911
In the PCL, Vernon beats up on Portland, winning 27-1.

1912
The WS opens. Giants manager John McGraw goes with rookie Jeff Tesreau,
his most effective late-season pitcher, against the Red Sox. Smoky Joe Wood
fans 11 and wins, 4-3, before 35,730 at New York.

1913
Christy Mathewson ties the Series, shutting the Athletics out for 10 innings
to beat Eddie Plank, 3-0. Mathewson also brings in the winning run with
a double in the 10th. In the 9th, Matty is saved twice by pitcher Hooks
Wiltse, playing 1B. Wiltse entered the game in the 3rd as a pinch runner
for Fred Snodgrass, pressed in to action at 1B. The A's put runners on 2B
and 3B with no outs in the final inning, and the next two batters hit shots
to 1B. Both times Wiltse guns out a runner at home and Matty gets the last
out to send the game into extra innings. Before the game, Walter Johnson
(36-7, 243 strikeouts, 11 shutouts) is presented with the Chalmers Award,
and an automobile, as the AL's MVP. Joe Jackson is 2nd in the voting.

1914
In Chicago, the White Sox even the city series with the Cubs by scoring 3
in the 9th off spitter Larry Cheney and winning, 5-2.

a triple, and steals 2 bases to give the Giants a win over the Yankees. Burns
gets serenaded with the wedding march in his first at-bat.

1915
The Red Sox start Ernie Shore in game 1 and the Phils manage just 3 hits and
one run through 7 innings against him. Grover Cleveland Alexander gives up
just one run as well. The Phils manage to push across two runs in the bottom
of the 8th on two infield singles and two walks. Babe Ruth makes his only
appearance in this WS, pinch hitting for Shore and grounding out. Grover
Alexander holds on for a 3-1 victory for the Phils.

1919
Ed Cicotte pitches game 7, and the Sox play like they mean it. Joe Jackson
and Felsch drive in 2 each for a 4-1 win. The Reds make 4 errors behind
Slim Sallee's pitching, before 32,006 Cincinnati fans who pay a record WS
game receipt total of $101,768.

1922
Behind Art Nehf's complete game five-hitter, the Giants repeat as World
Champions sweeping the Yankees in five games, including one tie. The comeback
5-3 victory is fueled by George Kelly's RBI single during the three-run
eighth inning at the Polo Grounds. Joe Bush loses his second in this WS.

1924
Walter Johnson tries for a WS win again, but he's far from invincible. Fred
Lindstrom is 4 for 5 with 2 RBIs, and Johnson's pitching opponent Jack
Bentley (16-5) clouts a 2-run homer for a 6-2 New York win.

1925
Kiki Cuyler's 2-run HR in the 8th breaks a 1-1 tie and gives the Pirates'
Vic Aldridge (15-7) a 3-2 win over Stan Coveleski (20-5).

1927
The 1927 Yankees, considered one of the best teams in baseball history, live
up to their reputation as they beat the Pirates, 4-3, to sweep the World
Series in four games. Carmen Hill (22-11) starts for the Pirates. In the
5th, Ruth's 2nd HR of the Series scores Earle Combs ahead of him for a 3-1
lead. The Pirates tie it in the 7th. In the last of the 9th, Combs walks,
Mark Koenig beats out a bunt, and Ruth walks to fill the bases. Reliever
Johnny Miljus strikes out Lou Gehrig and Bob Meusel looking. With 2 strikes
on Tony Lazzeri, a wild pitch rolls far enough away for Combs to score the
winning run. In the Series Ruth's .400 is good for 7 RBIs; Lloyd Waner's
.400 tops the Bucs.

1929
Howard Ehmke (7-2), who has been scouting the Cubs for a week, is the
Athletics' surprise starter in game 1 of the WS at Chicago. A crowd of
50,740 Cubs fans watches Ehmke strike out a WS-record 13 that will stand
until Brooklyn's Carl Erskine fans 14 Yankees in 1953. He holds the Cubs
scoreless until the 9th for a 3-1 win. Charlie Root (19-6) yields just 3
hits, but one is a HR by Jimmie Foxx in the 7th.

1930
George Earnshaw finishes off the Cardinals, 7-1, pitching shutout ball
until the 9th inning. He is clearly the pitching star of the WS with 2
wins and 7 shutout innings in a game in which reliever Lefty Grove got the
decision. Despite the "lively" 1930 ball and the many outstanding hitters
on both sides, it is a pitching-dominated Series. The Cards bat only .200
as a team and the A's .197. The A's staff has a combined ERA of 1.73.

1932
Washington names 27-year-old SS Joe Cronin as manager.

Chicago's star pitcher Lon Warneke.

mark, and besting Eddie Plank's mark of 13 set in 1913.

1938
The Series moves to Yankee Stadium, and New York rolls to its 3rd straight
win, with Monte Pearson beating Clay Bryant, 5-2. Bill Dickey and Joe
Gordon homer.

1939
In the 10th inning of game 4, the Reds make 3 errors and watch in shock
as the Yankees run wild, scoring three runs. The inning is climaxed by
Joe DiMaggio's slide across the plate (starting the play on first base)
left unguarded by Ernie Lombardi, who was stunned by a kick in the groin
by the preceding runner, Charlie Keller. The Yankees win, 7-4, beating
Walters for the 2nd time, and sweep the Reds to win their 4th straight World
Championship. Starter Paul Derringer guns down the first 14 Yankees to tie a
WS mark set exactly two years ago. It will not be tied or topped this century.

1940
With only one day's rest, Bobo Newsom comes back for the Tigers and nearly has
enough to win. Detroit gets an unearned run off Paul Derringer in the 3rd,
and Newsom holds the Reds scoreless through 6 innings. In the 7th, however,
Frank McCormick and Jimmy Ripple hit consecutive doubles, and Ripple later
ambles in from 3B on Billy Myers' sac fly. The Reds win, 2-1. Derringer
gives up 7 hits in the first 6 innings but sets the Tigers down in order in
the final 3 frames. Old Jimmy Wilson catches 6 of the 7 games, hits .353,
and has the only SB of the Series. The Reds' share is $5,803 and the Tigers
get $3,532. Bill McKechnie becomes the first manager to win a World Series
with two different teams. The 'Deacon' also piloted the Pirates to a World
Championship beating Washington in seven games in the 1925 Fall Classic.

1944
Mort Cooper strikes out 12; Denny Galehouse, 10. But the Cards get the runs
to win, 3-0.

1945
Stan Hack's double takes a tricky bounce over LF Hank Greenberg's shoulder
with 2 outs in the 12th inning to give the Chicago Cubs an 8-7 win in the 6th
game of the WS. Hack has 4 hits, 3 RBIs, and reaches base 6 times. Borowy
pitches 4 scoreless innings in relief, while Dizzy Trout, Detroit's 5th
pitcher, is the loser. The Series is now tied at 3 games apiece. Greenberg's
homer in the 8th is one of 13 hits for Detroit; Chicago counters with 15.

1948
Facing only thirty batters, Indians rookie hurler Gene Bearden five-hits
the Braves for a 2-0 victory in front of 70,000 fans in Cleveland. Bearden
also has two hits in beating Vern Bickford. The Tribe takes a 2-1 World
Series game lead.

1949
Allie Reynolds relieves Lopat with 2 on and 2 out in the 6th, strikes out

for the 1958 season.

1958
The New York Yankees win the 1958 World Series handily as Moose Skowron's
3-run homerun off Milwaukee Braves pitcher Lew Burdette in the 8th inning
puts the game on ice, 6-2. The Yankees become only the second team to come
back from a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series, joining the
Pittsburgh Pirates, who did it in the 1925 World Series. (The Boston Americans
(Red Sox) came back from a 3-1 deficit in the first World Series in 1903,
but that was a best-of-nine series.) Milwaukee's Eddie Mathews strikes
out for the 11th time, a record that will stand until 1980 when broken by
Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals. The Braves' 53 strikeouts are also
a new World Series record. This is Casey Stengel's 7th world championship,
tying him with Joe McCarthy for the most Series won.

The Giants send pitchers Ernie Broglio and Marv Grissom to St. Louis for
Billy Muffett, C Hobie Landrith and Ben Valenzuela. The Card win this swap
as Broglio will blossom into a star.

gives the slugger a new 6-game RBI record of 10. Chuck Essegian hits his 2nd
pinch HR to establish a new record, later equaled by Bernie Carbo of the
Red Sox in 1975. Each Dodger receives a record $11,231 winning share. The
White Sox get a record $7,275 for losing.

1960
Bombing continues in the Bronx in game 3. Yankee Bobby Richardson's 6 RBIs,
including a grand slam off reliever Clem Labine in a 6-run first inning,
and Whitey Ford's 4-hitter give the Yanks a 10-0 win and a 2-1 WS lead,
spoiling Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh's 43rd birthday.

1961
In game 4 at Crosley Field, Whitey Ford blanks the Reds for five innings to
extend his World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak to 32 breaking
Red Sox hurler Babe Ruth's previous record of 29 2/3 innings. Jim Coates
blanks the Reds for four innings. Hector Lopez and Clete Boyer each drive
in 2 runs for a 7-0 win.

1972
In the seventh inning of game 2 of the ALCS, Oakland Athletics shortstop
Bert Campaneris is hit in the ankle by a pitch thrown by the Detroit
Tigers' Lerrin LaGrow. An enraged Campaneris throws his bat at LaGrow,
sparking a bench-clearing brawl in which Tiger manager Billy Martin has to
be restrained from going after Campaneris. Both Campaneris and LaGrow are
suspended for the rest of the series, with Campaneris being tagged with a
fine as well. The Athletics win the game, 6-0. Detroit manages just 3 hits

2012 option on the contract of their manager Brad Mills and add a club
option for the following season. After a dismal 17-34 start and the loss
of veterans Roy Oswalt to Philadelphia and Lance Berkman to New York,
the first-year skipper pilots Houston to a 59-52 record after June 1.

2018
Brock Holt of the Red Sox became the first player in Major League postseason
history to hit for the cycle, doing so in a 16–1 rout in Game 3 of the
American League Division Series against the New York Yankees.

2022
The Cleveland Guardians and Tampa Bay Rays set a Major League postseason
record with 39 combined strikeouts: Tampa Bay with 20 and Cleveland with
19 in Game 2 of the ALWCS. This game also set the record for the longest
scoreless postseason game in Major League history, with the first (and only)
run scored in the 15th inning. Both records were surpassed a week later by
the Astros and Mariners.
