Oct 30

1911
Clark Griffith is named manager at Washington, beginning a stand in the
Capital as manager, then owner, that will last until his death in 1955.

1922
The Giants pay $65,000 and 3 players to Baltimore for Jack Bentley,
"another Babe Ruth." Bentley hit .349 and was 13-1 as a pitcher in 1922
(41-5 since 1920). The 3 players are to be delivered by March 20, 1923, and
if not satisfactory to Baltimore, the Giants will pay $2,500 per man instead.

1929
Former C Gabby Street is named manager of the Cardinals.

1956
The sale of the historic, but out-of-date, Ebbets Field to real estate
developer Marvin Kratter becomes one of the first indications the ballpark
is nearing its end, and, perhaps, a harbinger of the Dodgers' exodus
from Brooklyn. As part of the deal, club owner Walter O'Malley is given
a three-year lease, with an additional two years to be added in January,
to stay and play at the Flatbush facility, which means the 'Bums' have a
potential home in the borough until 1961.

1963
Sandy Koufax, who unanimously won the Cy Young Award six days ago, is
also named the National League's MVP. The Dodger legend out-points Pirates
infielder Dick Groat, 237-190.

1964
Joe Stanka of the Nankai Hawks wins the Pacific League MVP award. With a
season record of 26-7, Stanka pitched his team to 3 straight victories over
the Yomiuri Giants to win the Japan Series. In his career with the Hawks
(1960-65), and later with the Taiyo Whales (1966), he will win 100 games,
the record for an American pitcher.

1967
Arthur Allyn announces that his White Sox will play 9 games in Milwaukee
in 1968. Chicago will become the first AL team to play regular season games
outside its own city since 1905.

1974
A's hurler Catfish Hunter is named the American League's Cy Young winner. The
25-game winner (2.49 ERA), due to a contract dispute with owner Charles
Finley, will be declared one of baseball's first free-agents, and will
become the game's highest paid pitcher in baseball when he signs a five-year
contract with the Yankees for $3.75 million.

1975
Giant pitcher John Montefusco (15-9, 2.88, 215) 'the Count', wins the National
League Rookie of the Year Award. Expo catcher Gary Carter finishes second.

1984
Tigers reliever Willie Hernandez wins the AL Cy Young Award, edging fellow
reliever Dan Quisenberry of the Royals. Hernandez was 9-3 with 32 saves
and a 1.92 ERA.

The Giants name Jim Davenport manager for the 1985 season.

1986
The Orioles trade Storm Davis to the Padres for catcher Terry Kennedy and
minor leaguer Mark Williamson. After getting off to a 2-7 start with an
ERA of 6.18 with San Diego, the right-hander will be dealt to Oakland in
August for players to named later.

1995
The Orioles name Davey Johnson as their new manager.

1996
The Phils name Terry Francona as manager, replacing Jim Fregosi. Francona
was 3B coach of the Tigers this past season.

1999
The Rockies trade long-time favorite Dante Bichette to the Reds in exchange
for OF Jeffrey Hammonds, P Stan Belinda and cash. No word on the fate of
Dante's Denver restaurant.

2000
Signing a three-year $2 million contract, broadcaster Bob Brenly, 46, is named
as manager of the Diamondbacks. The former major league catcher replaces Buck
Showalter, the club's only manager, who was let go at the end of the season.

2001
George W. Bush becomes the eighth president to attend a World Series game
and the first since Dwight D. Eisenhower to throw out the ceremonial first
pitch. Wearing a New York Fire Department windbreaker in honor of the heroes
of the September 11 attacks, the Commander in Chief walks to the mound by
himself, gives a thumbs up, and throws a perfect strike to the Yankees'
backup catcher much to the delight of the stadium faithful.

Roger Clemens and Mariano Rivera hurl the Yankees to a 2-1 victory in game 3
of the WS. Jorge Posada homers for New York while Scott Brosius' 6th-inning
single drives home the winning run. Brian Anderson takes the loss for Arizona.

2007
The Yankees sign Joe Girardi to three-year deal worth a reported $7.5
million to replace popular manager Joe Torre, who left earlier this month
rejecting a 29% pay cut after guiding his club to their 12th post-season
appearance in 12 years. The 43-year-old former catcher and broadcaster,
the NL manager of the year with the 2006 Marlins, beat out coaches Don
Mattingly and Tony Pena to become the team's 32nd skipper.

Calling it a mutual decision, Dodgers GM Ned Colletti announces Grady Little
(170-154, .525) has decided to leave the organization with a year left on
his three-year contract to manage the club. The resignation fuels speculation
of the club hiring former Yankee manager Joe Torre as the team's new skipper.

Citing the veteran catcher's ability to mentor younger players, the Astros
re-sign Brad Ausmus to a one-year $2 million incentive-laden deal. The
38-year Gold Glove backstop is expected to have a reduced role next season
as rookie sensation J.R. Towles takes over behind plate for Houston.

Ria Cortesio, professional baseball's only active female umpire and sixth
overall, is released after nine years of making calls in the minors. The
31-year-old crew chief, whose mask is in the Hall of Fame, worked the Futures
Game and Home Run Derby at the 2006 All-Star game played in Pittsburgh,
and she was on the bases for an exhibition game between the Diamondbacks
and Cubs during spring training.

2008
Ken Macha is hired by the Brewers to manage the team. The former A's skipper,
fired by Oakland after the club was swept by Detroit in the 2006 ALCS,
replaces Dale Sveum, the interim manager who took over when Ned Yost was
let go with a dozen games left in the regular season.

Adding another first baseman to an already crowded field at that position,
the Royals obtain Mike Jacobs (.247, 32, 93) from the Marlins in exchange
for reliever Leo Nunez (4-1, 2.98). The 28-year infielder from Florida gives
Kansas City a much-needed left-handed slugger in the middle of the lineup.

2009
Tom Ricketts, the Cubs' chairman, makes it clear that the intent of the
new ownership is to win a World Championship. At his introductory press
conference, the investment banker tells the media he believes a thoughtful,
long-range approach is needed for the team to succeed in overcoming its
101-year absence from the Fall Classic.

Freddy Sanchez signs a $12-million two-year contract extension to stay with
the Giants, the team the Pirates traded him to in mid-season in exchange for
a minor league pitching prospect. Due to an ailing shoulder, the two-time
all-star second baseman and former batting champ played in only 25 games
with San Francisco.

2010
Defeating San Francisco, the Rangers win their first World Series game in
franchise history, 4-2. With the Astros being swept by the White Sox in
2005, the victory is also the first by any Texas team in the Fall Classic,
snapping a Lone Star State losing streak of six games.

2012
The Tigers announce Jim Leyland's contract has been extended through 2013,
after he managed the team to an American League pennant on a one-year deal
this season. The 67-year-old skipper has been a major league manager for
21 years, including the last seven with Detroit, where he led the club to
the postseason three times and the World Series twice.

2013
Boston captures the World Championship at Fenway Park for the first time since
1918 when they beat the Cardinals, 6-1, in Game 6 of the Fall Classic. The
team, that had suffered an 86-year drought between World Series titles,
has now won three crowns in the past ten years.
