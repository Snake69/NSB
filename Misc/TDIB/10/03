Oct 3

1903
Deacon Phillippe comes back on one day's rest to beat Boston, 4-2, before
18,801, the biggest crowd of the Series. Jimmy Collins has half the Boston
hits with a single and a double. There are 7 ground-rule doubles in the game,
4 of which go into the crowd.

1904
Christy Mathewson of the Giants strikes out 16 Cards in a 3-1 Giants
victory. Big 6's sixteen strikeouts establishes a new ML record as he
furnishes the game in 1 hour 15 minutes. A crowd of just 300 is on hand in
New York. Matty's 16 K's is one better than St. Louis Brownie Fred Glade's
15 recorded on June 15.

The second place Chicago Cubs make 5 errors, but coast to a 16-5 win over
the Beaneaters as Boston fumbles 10 times. The 15 errors ties the NL mark
for 2 teams and will not be matched this century.

1905
The National Commission establishes the rules for a World Series and names
Hank O'Day and John Sheridan (both NL umps) to umpire it.

Brooklyn hurler Doc Scanlon hurls 2 complete-game victories over host
St. Louis, winning by scores of 4-0 and 3-2. Doc gives up 12 hits in his
18 innings.

The Reds win the opener of 2 from the league-champion Giants, and pull off
a triple play. With the bases loaded and no outs in the 7th, RF Cy Seymour
catches a line drive, fires home to nab the runner from 3B, and the throw
back to 3B gets the advancing runner. An 8-2-5-6 TP. Bob Ewing wins his
20th, 4-2, with the nitecap ending in a 4-4 tie. Seymour has 4 hits in the
twinbill and will lead the NL in hitting with .377.

1906
The smallest crowd in Polo Grounds history - 300 - watches the Phils beat
the Giants, 3-1. The Giants will attract about 400,000 over the season and
be outdrawn by the Highlanders by about 20,000.

The White Sox clinch the AL pennant during a rainout at St. Louis. Chicago
achieves the lowest team BA ever for a pennant winner with .228. Hence,
the "Hitless Wonders."

The Athletics beat New York, 3-0, to end the pennant chase. While being
given an intentional walk in the 3rd inning, Harry Davis clouts a 3-run
homer for all the scoring.

A syndicate headed by Art Soden sells the last place Boston Beaneaters (NL)
to George and John Dovey for $75,000. The Dovey brothers will change the
name of the team to the Doves, but retain manager Fred Tenney, who helped
with the sale.

1907
The Red Sox end their 16-game losing streak by nipping the Browns, 1-0. Cy
Morgan is the victor over Harry Howell.

1908
The incident of September 23rd would have become just another odd event in
baseball if the Giants had been able to handle the 4th-place Phillies. But
rookie lefthander Harry Coveleski, just up from the minor leagues, earns
the nickname "Giant Killer" by beating them, 3-2, for the 3rd time in 5
days. Mathewson takes the loss.

At a hearing on the September 23rd incident, Pulliam does not call Merkle or
any other players as witnesses, saying he was at the game and saw the events
himself. He affirms his earlier decision. Two days later, NL directors meet
in Cincinnati and order the game replayed on October 8th.

The Tigers roll to their 10th straight win when Wild Bill Donovan shuts
out the Browns, 6-0, while Cleveland loses, 3-2, to the White Sox. Detroit
leads the AL by 1 1/2 games.

In the finale at Philadelphia's Columbia Park, the A's split with Boston,
losing 8-7, but winning the nitecap, 5-0 in 6 innings. Wood allows just a
single to Coombs.

1911
In the 2nd inning at New York, the Red Sox pull off a double steal with Duffy
Lewis scoring from 3B and Jack Lewis swiping 2B (as noted by Retrosheet). Jack
Lewis is shaken up on the play and the Hilltoppers allow Duffy to replace
him at 2B as a courtesy runner. He doesn't score and Jack returns to the
game as Boston wins, 4-1. They take the nitecap, 7-0, behind Joe Wood and
will win tomorrow over host New York, 4-1, behind Eddie Cicotte. The Sox
will win 10 straight in New York in 1912, and the first 5 games there in
1913 - a ML record 18 games on the road versus one team. Brooklyn will tie
the record in 1946, and the Cardinals will tie it in 1966.

1912
In Philadelphia, the Red Sox roll over the A's, 17-5, as Joe Wood coasts to
his 34th win of the year. Smoky Joe strikes out 6 and scatters 8 hits. Duffy
Lewis has a grand slam for the winners.

In New York, the Senators clinch 2nd place, a game ahead of the A's, by
edging the Highlanders, 4-3. Walter Johnson notches his 33rd win (or 32nd
by some counts).

The Chalmers Auto Commission announce that Tris Speaker (59 points) and
Larry Doyle (48 points) each win an automobile as the 'most value' players
in their respective leagues.

1914
At Boston, Red Sox starter Ernie Shore gives up an unearned Yankee run in
the 1st, and the score is 1-0 when he departs after 7 innings. Both teams
score 2 in the 9th inning, New York's runs coming against reliever Guy
Cooper. The scorer nails Cooper with the loss for pitching poorly.

1915
The Chicago Whales (FL) clinch the pennant by winning the 2nd game of a
doubleheader with the Pittsburgh Rebels.

Ty Cobb steals his 96th base of the season, against Cleveland's catcher
Steve O'Neil, for a new ML season record. He also sets a ML record for
times caught stealing with 38, a mark Henderson will top in 1982. The
Tigers win 100 games, the first time a runner-up has reached that mark,
and have the top three RBI producers - Crawford (112), Veach (112), Cobb
(99). This is the first of only two times in the AL that teammates have
had the top three RBI spots (Yankees in 1928).

The Pirates end their season with a 5-3 win over the Reds. Retiring manager
Fred Clarke hosts a dinner for the players after the game, and also celebrates
his 43rd birthday.

1916
Brooklyn tops the Giants, 8-6, and clinches the pennant. A disgusted McGraw
leaves the bench in the 5th inning, convinced his players aren't trying
against the Robins, who feature many ex-Giants on the roster. The Pittsburgh
Post calls it "one of the bushiest games ever staged in the big leagues"
(as noted by Greg Beston). Among the many questionable plays happens when
Giant pitcher Pol Perritt pitches from a windup with a runner on first base,
giving a Brooklyn runner an easy steal. "I do not believe that any of my
players deliberately favored Brooklyn, but they did not play my kind of
baseball," says McGraw after the game. "They did not obey my orders. ... I'm
through with baseball for the year. I have worked too hard this summer to
tolerate that stuff."

Meanwhile, the Phils drop a doubleheader to the Braves at home, 6-3 and 6-1,
to drop 2 1/2 games behind with two games to play.

1917
After six losses to Babe Ruth, including three by 1-0 scores (one in
13 innings), Walter Johnson finally emerges a winner against the Boston
lefty. Johnson contributes a bases-loaded double in the 8th to help visiting
Washington win, 6-0. Ruth gives up 11 hits and his ERA balloons to 2.01
for the year.

1919
Cuban native Adolfo Luque becomes the first player from Latin America to
appear in a World Series. In game 3 of the Fall Classic, 'the Pride of
Havana' pitches a scoreless eighth inning for the Reds in a 3-0 loss to
the White Sox at Comiskey Park.

Back in Chicago, 5 foot 7 inch rookie lefty Dickie Kerr pitches a 3-hitter,
as Chicago wins, 3-0. Joe Jackson is 2 for 3 and Gandil drives in 2 runs. Ray
Fisher takes the loss. Cuban Adolfo Luque becomes the first Latin American
ML player to appear in a WS game, pitching one inning of relief for the
Reds in game 3 at Comiskey Park.

1920
In the Browns' 16-7 win over Chicago, George Sisler has 3 hits and gets his
257th hit of the season to set a ML record. His 4 total bases today gives
him a ML record 399 for the year. Sisler throws in 3 stolen bases and,
acceding to the demands of the fans, also hurls a scoreless 9th inning in
relief, striking out 2.

At Cincinnati, Reds recruit Dazzy Swartz makes his big-league debut, hurling
a 12-inning complete game, scattering 17 hits, and losing to the Cards,
6-3. He adds a 2 for 4 at-bat, but never plays another game in the ML.

1923
Ruth, playing in an exhibition game for John McGraw at the Polo Grounds,
bashes the first HR ever hit over the RF roof.

1924
At Philadelphia's Baker Bowl, the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National
League beat the Eastern Colored League's Hilldale Giants (PA), 6-2, in
the opening game of the first Colored World Series. The ten-game event,
in which KC will capture the crown winning 5 games to 4 with one tie,
features games played in Chicago, Kansas City and Baltimore.

1926
Grover Alexander (9-7) faces Urban Shocker (19-11) as a record 63,600 look
on. The Yankees score twice in the 2nd, but Old Pete sets down the last 21
batters, striking out 10. Billy Southworth and SS Tommy Thevenow collect 3
hits each, including a homerun apiece, for a 6-2 St. Louis win. Thevenow's
is a line drive that skips by Ruth for an inside-the-park homer. Thevenow
will hit 2 regular season HRs in his career - both inside-the-park.

In Baltimore, the Bacharach Giants' Red Grier tosses a 10-0 no-hitter
against the Chicago American Giants in the 3rd game of the Negro League
World Series. Grier wins just more one game before an unexplained ailment
ends his career.

1929
At St. Louis, the Browns' General Crowder tops the Indians, 3-2 in 10
innings. Accounting for the Indians' scoring is Earl Averill's 2-run HR,
his 18th of the year and his 5th off the general. Only George Kelly's
6 off Vic Aldridge in 1923 (and later on, Williams in 1941 off Rigney,
and Kluszewski in 1954 off Surkont) will top Earl's 5, according to homer
historian Dave Vincent.

1933
In the battle of first-year managers, the Giants take the opener of the
WS at the Polo Grounds, as Carl Hubbell holds the Senators to 5 hits and
3 unearned runs. Washington unravels when Buddy Myer makes a record-tying
3 errors. Mel Ott is the hitting star, tying a WS record with 4 for 4.

1934
Dizzy Dean wins the opening game of the WS, 8-3, as Detroit manager Mickey
Cochrane holds back his ace, Schoolboy Rowe. Veteran Al Crowder is ineffective
as the Cardinals romp. Joe Medwick homers in a 4 for 4 day while the Tigers
make 5 errors.

1935
The Tigers even the Series behind Tommy Bridges, 8-3, but lose Hank Greenberg
who fractures his left wrist sliding home when trying to score from first
on a single.

1936
Game 3 shifts to Yankee Stadium and a new attendance record of 64,842. Lou
Gehrig's solo HR is matched by the Giants' Jimmy Ripple, with the deciding
run of the Yankees' 2-1 squeaker coming on an infield hit.

1937
At Navin Field, in the season finale, Hank Greenberg gets the lone ribbie
when Detroit defeats the Indians, 1-0. The twenty-six-year-old Tiger first
baseman finishes the season with 183 RBIs, just one shy of Lou Gehrig's
1931 American League record. Indian Johnny Allen's effort on 2 days rest to
tie the AL record of 16 straight wins is frustrated. Detroit's Jake Wade
gets the win. A miffed Allen almost comes to blows with Hale after the
game. Allen finishes with 14 complete games, a 15-1 mark, for an AL record
winning percentage of .938.

The Pirates take a closing day doubleheader from the Reds, 4-3 and 4-0,
extending their win streak to 10, and the Reds' losing run to 14. The
Pirates beat the Reds 21 of 22 games, tying the ML record set by the Cubs
over the Braves in 1909 and the Yankees over the Browns in 1927. They won
17 straight over the Reds, starting with game 2 of a doubleheader on May
31. The Bucs will tack on three more wins in 1938 to set a ML record of 20
straight over the Reds.

The A's and Senators split a pair, the A's winning 5-4, and the Nats
taking the nitecap, 4-3 in 5 innings. Rookie Joe Kohlman (1-0), who won
25 straight for Salisbury (25-1 in the Eastern League), with 2 no hitters,
is the nitecap winner over Earle Mack's A's. It's Kohlman's only ML decision.

Hal Schumacher, the first of 3 pitchers for the Giants is credited with
the win as the Giants trip the Dodgers, 4-1. Schumacher belts a 3-run HR in
the 2nd. Manager Burleigh Grimes uses a ML-record-tying 23 players in the
game. Grimes is also thumbed out of the game for the 10th time this season.

1938
In Chicago, 300,000 turn out to cheer the Cubs motorcade through downtown.

1939
Frank Frisch abandons the broadcasting booth to return to managing, signing
for 2 years with the Pirates.

1940
Bucky Walters gives the NL its first Series game victory since Carl Hubbell
beat the Yankees in 1937. Jimmy Ripple's 2-run HR in the 3rd provides the
margin. Walters gives up only 3 hits, but is lucky to escape a jittery
first inning.

1942
The Cards win their second in a row as Ernie White shuts out New York on 6
hits, winning 2-0. Arguments during the game result in $200 fines for Joe
Gordon and Frank Crosetti; the latter will also be suspended for the first
30 days of the 1943 season for shoving umpire Bill Summers.

1945
The Tigers and Cubs meet in the WS for the 4th time. Hank Borowy pitches
a 6-hitter and Hal Newhouser is roughed up for 8 runs in 3 innings, as the
Cubs win, 9-0.

1946
The St. Louis Cardinals wallop the Brooklyn Dodgers, 8-4, at Ebbets Field to
win the NL playoffs 2-0 and advance to the WS. Erv Dusak and Enos Slaughter
lead the attack, while winning pitcher Murry Dickson adds a triple. Dickson
allows just two hits till the last inning, before the Dodgers score three
runs off him. Harry Brecheen strikes out two batters with the bases full
to end it. Joe Hatten is the loser.

1947
At Ebbets Field, in game 4 of the Fall Classic, Bill Bevens comes within
one out of pitching the first no-hitter in World Series history. The
Yankee hurler loses his claim to fame and the game when Cookie Lavagetto,
pinch-hitting for Eddie Stanky, hits a two-out ninth-inning double giving
the Dodgers a 3-2 improbable victory.

1948
On the last day of the regular season, Cleveland's hopes for a Yankee win
over the Red Sox are dashed when New York rookie Bob Porterfield can't hold
a 2-0 lead. With New York trailing, 5-4, reliever Vic Raschi gives up HRs
to Dom DiMaggio, one of his 4 hits, and Vern Stephens in the 6th inning, and
Boston wins, 10-5. The other DiMaggio has two doubles, two singles and 3 RBIs
for New York. Earl Johnson, in relief of Joe Dobson in the 5th, is the winner.

Detroit hitters cuff Bob Feller and 5 relievers for 15 hits to make
Newhouser's 21st win an easy 7-1 victory. It is Newhouser's 2nd and
last win over Feller in his career. Vic Wertz has three doubles for the
Bengals. Despite the loss, Bill Veeck donates the club's share from the gate
receipts of 74,191 to Cleveland's Community Chest. The Indians and the Red Sox
end the year in a tie, necessitating a one-game playoff. But a philosophical
Veeck observes, "We feel that no matter who pitches tomorrow for Boston,
he'll not be a Newhouser - certainly not the Newhouser we faced today."

Johnny Vander Meer fires a 2-hit shutout to beat the Pirates, 1-0. The win
keeps the Reds out of last place.

Johnny Mize hits his 40th HR of the year to again tie Ralph Kiner for the NL
lead, as was the case in 1947. Kiner had hit his final 1948 HR on September
26. In 1946 rookie Kiner led with 23 to the 22 of Mize, who missed 50 games
because of injury.

Luke Easter's grand slam highlights the Homestead Grays' 19-hit assault on
the Birmingham Black Barons in the 4th game of the Negro World Series. The
Grays will win the Championship in 5 games. This will be the final Negro WS,
as the Negro National League becomes a casualty of integration and folds
during the winter.

1950
Baseball rules that Phils lefty Curt Simmons cannot play in the WS despite
his being on furlough from the Army.

1951
In game 3 of the National League play-off series at the Polo Grounds, the
Giants' Bobby Thomson hits the most famous homerun in history, off Ralph
Branca. His "shot heard round the world" with 2 runners on and trailing 4-2
in the bottom of the 9th defeats Brooklyn, 5-4, and sends the jubilant Giants
into the WS. For Branca, it is his 6th loss of the season against the Giants,
who have now hit 11 HRs off him this year. Whitey Lockman sets up Thomson's
blast by hitting a double off Newcombe with Al Dark on 3B and Don Mueller
on 1B. Mueller breaks his ankle sliding into 3B and is carried off the field.

1952
Brooklyn's Preacher Roe wins in Yankee Stadium, 5-3. Brooklyn scores 2 runs
in the 9th on Yogi Berra's passed ball.

1953
The Dodgers even up the WS at 2 games apiece, as Duke Snider drives in 4
runs in a 7-3 victory.

1955
No more "wait till next year" as Brooklyn, behind the 2-0 pitching of Johnny
Podres, brings its first WS championship to Brooklyn in 8 tries. Sixth-inning
replacement Sandy Amoros races over to the wall in LF to one-hand an
opposite-field bid for extra bases by Yogi Berra with the tying runs
on. Amoros turns and fires to SS Pee Wee Reese who throws a bullet to Gil
Hodges at 1B for the DP on Yankee base runner Gil McDougald. Brooklyn pulls
off 12 DPs in the WS, a new record.

1956
Sal Maglie and the Dodgers defeat the Yankees, 6-3, in the first game of
the WS.

1957
In game 2 Lew Burdette defeats the Yankees and Bobby Shantz, 4-2.

1958
The Cardinals ship OF Del Ennis, SS Eddie Kasko and P Bob Mabe to the Reds
for George Crowe, P Alex Kellner and SS Alex Grammas.

1960
The Yankees head into the WS with a 15-game winning streak, the 8th longest
streak in the AL this century, after Dale Long's 2-run 9th-inning HR gives
them an 8-7 win over the Red Sox. New York's 193 HRs are an AL record,
3 better than the 1956 Yanks. RBI leader Roger Maris drives in 3 runs,
but falls one HR short of Mickey Mantle's league-high 40.

Joe Gordon (26-31) resigns as manager of the Tigers, blaming interference
from club president Bill DeWitt. Gordon will be named manager of the KC
Athletics, replacing Bob Elliott.

1962
At Dodger Stadium, the Giants win the rubber game of the National League
playoffs beating Los Angeles, 6-4, as Don Larsen gets the win in relief of
Juan Marichal. Thanks to the extended season, Maury Wills sets a major league
record for the most games played in a season appearing in 165 games. A crowd
of 45,693, giving the Dodgers a ML-record season attendance of 2,755,184,
attends the deciding game of the NL season. In the 7th, Maury Wills collects
his 4th single of the day, and his 103rd and 104th steals of the year. But
the Giants score 4 in the 9th to win and put themselves in the WS.

1963
In game 2, Johnny Podres scatters 7 hits, Tommy Davis ties a WS record
with 2 triples, Willie Davis drives in 2 runs, Moose Skowron homers, and
Los Angeles beats Al Downing, 4-1, to go 2 up.

1964
The Yankees clinch their 5th straight pennant, 14th in the last 16 years,
and 29th in the club's history, by defeating Cleveland, 8-3.

As a result of the now-concluded Phillies' 10-game losing streak, this
day begins with four teams still having a mathematical shot at the NL
pennant. One of them, the San Francisco Giants, is eliminated with a 10-7
loss to the Chicago Cubs. At the end of the day's play, the Reds and the
Cardinals (the Cardinals lose to the Mets, 15-5) are tied for first place,
with the Phillies a game back. In recent days, the NL has had to scramble
to schedule various possible playoffs.

Boston fires manager Johnny Pesky (70-90). Billy Herman takes over for the
final game of season.

1965
On the last day of the season, Giants outfielder Willie Mays hits his 52nd
homerun to break the franchise record he established in 1955. The "Say Hey
Kid's" league leading homerun is given up by Reds hurler Billy McCool as
San Francisco defeats Cincinnati at Candlestick Park, 6-3.

At Metropolitan Stadium, Angels first baseman Vic Power (Pellot) ends his
12-year major league career going 1 for 5 with a RBI single in a 5-2 loss
to the Twins. The .284 career hitter will have the distinction of being
the last active player to have worn a Philadelphia A's uniform (1954).

Cardinal right-hander Bob Gibson goes the distance, beating Houston at the
Astrodome, 5-2, to become a 20-game winner for the first time. The future
Hall of Famer will win twenty games four more times in the next five seasons.

The Cubs tie a ML record with their 3rd triple play of the season - 1B Ernie
Banks to SS Don Kessinger - but Pittsburgh wins, 6-3, at Forbes Field. Bill
Faul is on the mound during each triple play. Submariner Ted Abernathy
suffers the loss to Roy Face, but concludes a record season for appearances
(84) and consecutive errorless games (84) for a pitcher. He has 31 saves.

Knuckleballer Eddie Fisher of the White Sox sets an AL record with his 82nd
appearance, one more than John Wyatt in 1964 as the Sox beat young Catfish
Hunter and the A's, 3-2.

The Yanks win, 11-5, at Boston as Tony Kubek goes 3 for 4 and clouts a
9th-inning homer off Dick Radatz in his final major league at-bat. The
29-year-old will be diagnosed over the winter as having three crushed
vertebrae, the result of a childhood football injury. He will quit rather
than risk further injury,

Six Dodgers pitchers, a ML shutout record, combine to blank the Braves, 3-0.

Sudden Sam McDowell (17-11) loses a 2-1 decision to Baltimore's Steve Barber,
but the 22-year-old Tribe southpaw wraps up the AL lead in ERA (2.18) and
strikeouts (325). Rocky Colavito plays his 162nd consecutive errorless game
(274 chances), a ML season record.

In a 6-3 loss to the Giants, Vada Pinson collects a hit in his 27th straight
game. This is the 2nd longest streak in Reds' history.

1966
Mayo Smith signs a 2-year contract to manage the Tigers.

Former Indian Joe Adcock will retire from active play and become manager
of the Tribe.

1968
In the third inning of game 2 of his complete-game World Series victory
over St. Louis, Tiger starting pitcher Mickey Lolich hits a solo homer off
Nelson Briles. The Busch Stadium round-tripper will be the only homerun
the southpaw will hit during his 16-year big league career. Detroit evens
the Series with a 6-hitter to defeat St. Louis, 8-1.

1970
Pitcher Mike Cuellar contributes a grand slam as the Orioles explode for
7 runs in the 4th inning to rout the Twins, 10-6, in the opening game of
the AL Championship Series. This is the first homer hit by a pitcher in
the LCS and the only homer a pitcher will hit in the ALCS during this century.

Pete Rose's RBI single in the 10th inning breaks up a scoreless game as
the Reds win the NLCS opener, 3-0, over Pittsburgh. Gary Nolan gets the
shutout victory for Cincinnati, as Dock Ellis takes the loss.

1971
Baltimore downs Oakland, 5-3, in the ALCS opener, as the Orioles score 4
runs in the 7th inning. OF Paul Blair caps the big inning with a 2-run double.

Bob Robertson crashes 3 HRs and a double, scoring 4 runs and driving home 5,
to lead Pittsburgh to a 9-4 triumph.

1972
Pitcher Roric Harrison hits his only homer of the year, off Ray Lamb, as
Baltimore beats Cleveland, 4-3, in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. With
the DH rule on the horizon, it will be the last HR hit by an AL pitcher
until interleague play. Cleveland wins the opener, 6-5 in 10 innings.
Tom McCraw has 4 hits, including a HR, for the Tribe.

The Tigers clinch the AL East as Woodie Fryman beats Luis Tiant, 3-1, for
his 10th win. Chuck Seelbach picks up his 14th save and Al Kaline singles
in the winning run for Detroit. Luis Tiant hits a single in the game; not
until Clemens singles in 1996 will another Sox pitcher get a hit in the
same game he pitches. Fryman also singles, off Tiant; not till interleague
play in 1997 will another Tiger pitcher get a base hit.

After hitting a pinch RBI single in the 9th to beat the Twins, 5-4, White
Sox reliever Terry Forster steals 2B. Forster, later described by David
Letterman as "a fat tub of goo," is the last AL pitcher before interleague
play to steal a base. Forster finished the year at .526 (10 for 19) and
will finish his 16-year career with a .397 lifetime average.

Steve Carlton wins his 27th game for the last-place Phillies (59-97), as
they pound out 6 HRs in an 11-1 win over Chicago. Carlton's total is the
highest by a Phillies pitcher in 20 years. Don Money and Greg Luzinski hit
back to back homers twice.

Tom Seaver of the New York Mets wins his 21st beating the Montreal Expos,
5-2, in the first game of a doubleheader. Steve Renko (1-10) takes the loss
despite striking out seven consecutive hitters. The Mets also win the second
game in 12 innings, 4-3.

1974
Frank Robinson becomes the first black manager in major league history. The
former Reds and Oriole superstar signs a $175,000 contract to manage and play
for the Indians. Robinson is replacing Ken Aspromonte for the 1975 season.

1976
Appearing as the designated hitter, Brewer Henry Aaron gets an infield
single off Tiger hurler Dave Roberts in his last major league at-bat and
drives in his 2,297th run. 'Hammerin' Hank' will be the last major leaguer
to appear in a big league game who also played in the Negro Leagues. The
6th-place Brewers lose to the Tigers today, 5-2.

On the last day of the season, Kansas City's George Brett and Hal McRae and
Minnesota's Rod Carew are separated by .001 for the batting title. In a 5-3
Royals loss to the Twins' Jim Hughes, George Brett edges Royals teammate
Hal McRae for the AL batting title, .333 to .332, when his blooper drops in
front of Twins OF Steve Brye and bounds over his head for an inside-the-park
HR. McRae, who then grounds out, believes the misplay is deliberate, and
initially charges the Twins with racism. Brett ends the day at 3 for 4,
McRae had 2 for 4 as did Rod Carew, who ends the day at .331. Brett is
also tops in plate appearances, and the last time an AL batting champ led
in that category was George Sisler in 1920.

The Cubs' Bill Madlock wrests the NL crown from the Reds' Ken Griffey by
going 4 for 4 in an 11-1 win over the Braves. The hits raise Madlock from
.333 to .339, one point ahead of the idle Griffey, who initially sits,
then belatedly joins the Reds' 8-2 win over the Expos and goes 0 for 2,
dipping his average to .336.

Jim Rooker and Jerry Reuss each pitch one-hit 1-0 shutouts as the Pirates
sweep a season-ending doubleheader from the Cardinals.

1978

AL Championship Series.

1979

Orioles a 6-3 win over the Angels in the first game of the ALCS.

The Pirates win in the 10th inning, 3-2, as Omar Moreno and Dave Parker
smack singles that snap a 2-2 tie.

1980

in the 9th, and win it in the 10th on a Joe Ferguson solo HR.

1981
In Cincinnati, Bob Horner homers twice and scores the winning run on Ron
Oester's 8th-inning throwing error to give the Braves a 4-3 win over the
Reds and give the Astros the 2nd-half title in the NL West. Cincinnati,
which lost the first-half title to the Dodgers by one-half game, will finish
with the best overall record (66-42) in the major leagues, but will not
make the playoffs.

The Mets lose, 5-4, to the Expos, though New York's Mike Cubbage hits an
8th-inning homerun, off Jeff Reardon. It is Cubbage's last ML at-bat.

Angel Moreno to give Texas a 1-0 win.

the NL East's 2nd playoff spot.

1982
On the last day of the season, at Memorial Stadium, Robin Yount smacks 2
homeruns and a triple as Milwaukee whips Baltimore, 10-2, to win the AL
East championship by 1 game over the Orioles. Don Sutton, 4-1 since being
acquired by the Brewers in late August, is the winning pitcher. The 51,642
hometown fans, although disappointed by the results, stay after the game
and give retiring manager Earl Weaver a heartfelt, tremendous 45-minute
series of ovations for his 15-year tenure as the Birds' skipper. Milwaukee
had lost 3 in a row to Baltimore before today's pivotal victory. Despite
Yount's stellar game, he loses the AL batting title .332 to .331 to Kansas
City's Willie Wilson, who sat out the Royals' final game. Yount ends the
year with 114 RBIs and joins teammates Cecil Cooper (121), Gorman Thomas
(112) and Ben Oglivie (102) as only the 2nd foursome since 1940 to top
the 100-RBI mark. The 1977 Bosox of Fisk, Rice, Hobson and Lynn were the
others. Ted Simmons is just 3 short of 100 RBIs or the Brewers would have
joined the 1936 Yankees as the only squad with five 100-RBI hitters.

Atlanta loses, 5-1, to San Diego, but clinches the NL West title anyway
when San Francisco beats the 2nd-place Dodgers, 5-3. As defending World
Series champions, the Dodgers' elimination from playoff contention is one
of the few times a defending champion has been eliminated on the final day
of the regular season.

Veteran Joe Rudi hits a double and a 4th-inning homer to pace to A's to
a 6-3 win at Kansas City, The homer comes in Rudi's last at-bat as he is
replaced by Kelvin Moore.

St. Louis edges the Cubs, 5-4 in 14 innings, after both clubs score in the
13th. Julio Gonzalez, who took over at 2B in the 3rd inning has 3 runs and 4
hits, including a game-winning leadoff HR in the 14th off Ken Kravec. Cubs
starter Doug Bird gets no decision but ends the year at 9-14, his first
losing season after 9 none-losing. This streak ties him with 7 post-war
pitchers:  Erskine, Ford, Pappas, Seaver, Marichal, Clemens, Hershiser.

Expos manager Jim Fanning resigns following the club's season-ending 6-1
win over the Pirates and will return to the club's front office. His 102-87
record as manager is the best in club history.

1983
Less than a year after leading the club to its first World Series, Brewers
manager Harvey Kuenn is fired and replaced by Rene Lachemann. Milwaukee

1984
Steve "Rainbow" Trout scatters 5 hits and Lee Smith slams the door in the
Cubs' 4-2 victory over the Padres.

Grubb's 2-run double in the 11th gives the win to the Tigers, 5-3.

1985
The Phillies score 8 runs in the 3rd inning at Montreal, and hold on for
an 8-7 win. Rick Schu has a pair of doubles in the big score, the first
Phillie ever to hit a pair of doubles in an inning. Fred Manrique has a
homer - his first in the majors - and a double to complete a rare season
cycle of 4 hits (single, double, triple, homer). The win is just the 2nd
in 13 games for the Quakers.

Bud Black fires a 3-hitter and George Brett slaps a 3-run inside-the-park
homer to beat the Angels, 4-0, moving KC back in a tie for the Al West.

last-place finish since moving from St. Louis in 1954.

1987
Benito Santiago goes 0 for 3 against Orel Hershiser in San Diego's 1-0 win
over Los Angeles, ending his ML-rookie-record hitting streak at 34 consecutive
games. Santiago's streak is also the longest ever by a catcher. The win
snaps the Padres' 9-game losing streak.

1988
After 2 disappointing seasons in Philadelphia, C Lance Parrish is traded
to California for a minor leaguer.

Astros manager Hal Lanier is fired after leading the club to an 82-80 record.

replacing Lee Elia, who was fired in September.

1989
Oakland's Dave Stewart wins the ALCS opener, 7-3, over Toronto.

Kirby Puckett wins an unlikely (at the time) American League batting title,
taking advantage of an off-year by Boston's Wade Boggs due to marital
issues. Puckett clinches the title in Seattle on a double in the final game
of the season, finishing with a final average of .339.

1990
George Brett pinch hits a fifth-inning RBI sac fly, and then singles in the
seventh inning to end the season winning the batting title with a .329 batting
average. The Royals superstar is the only player to win three batting crowns
in three different decades (1976 - .333; 1980 - .390). KC loses to Cleveland
today, 5-2. Willie McGee's .335 wins the NL batting title despite having
been traded out of the league in August. He hits .324 overall. Eddie Murray
is 2 for 3 in the Dodgers' 7-3 loss to San Diego. Murray ends the season
with a .330 batting average, the highest in the majors, but he wins no title.

Boston beats Chicago, 3-1, on the final day of the season to wrap up its 3rd
AL East title in 5 seasons. Tom Brunansky ends the game with a spectacular
sliding catch in the RF corner with the tying runs on base.

Cecil Fielder becomes the 11th player ever to hit 50 HRs when he belts his
50th and 51st in the Tigers' season finale, a 10-3 win over New York. He
is the first AL player since 1961 to reach the 50 mark. Kevin Maas and Gary
Ward also homer as Jack Morris (15-18) is the winner. Maas ends the season
with 21 homers and 41 RBIs, the only player, till Barry Bonds in 2001 to
not double his homer total in RBIs.

At Pittsburgh, Frank Viola wins his 20th when the Mets beat the Pirates,
6-3. In front of his hometown fans, New York's George Jelic homers - his
first, last and only hit in the majors. It comes off Doug Bair on his last
at-bat. Buc Jerry Reuss, in his only start this year, gives up one earned run,
a HR to Teufel in the 6th, but gets no decision in his last appearance in the
majors. Reuss, with 4 appearances this year, joins the exclusive 4-decade
club (1969-90) and also closes out his career with 220 wins, but never 20
in a season, a ML record. Milt Pappas also won 200 that way as did Tanana
this year. Tanana will end his career with 233 wins and no 20-win seasons.

1991
In the 2nd game of a doubleheader against the Minnesota Twins, Chicago C
Carlton Fisk smashes 2 HRs to lead the White Sox to a 13-12 victory. In doing
so, just 9 months shy of his 44th birthday, Fisk becomes the oldest 20th
century player to hit a pair of 4-baggers in the same game. His 7th-inning
grand slam off Steve Bedrosian also makes him the oldest major leaguer ever
to hit a bases-loaded homer. Cap Anson, at 45, clubbed two homers on this
date in 1897 ... he's the oldest to hit a pair.

1992
In a battle of also-rans at Fenway Park, the Red Sox trip the Yankees, 7-5,
with the win going to Gardner, who throws 6 2/3 innings of relief. Cooper
and Plantier hit HRs for the Sox, who end the season's power outage with
84 homeruns. Except for the strike year of '94, this is the only season
since 1945 the Sox have not reached 100 dingers. Slugger Jack Clark drops
from 28 to 5 road homers this year.

The Toronto Blue Jays clinch their second straight American League East
title with a 3-1 win over the Detroit Tigers.

At Milwaukee, the A's knock the 2nd place Brewers out of the race, beating
them, 10-3. The A's, first in the AL West, knock 4 homers including Mark
McGwire's 42nd. Ricky Bones lasts just 1 1/3 innings and takes the loss. Mike
Moore wins his 17th.

1993
Despite winning 103 games, the Giants are eliminated from the Western

Mike Piazza, who will be named the league's Rookie of the Year, hits two
homeruns in the game.

Eighty-three-year-old Mel Harder throws the ceremonial 'last' pitch at
Cleveland Municipal Stadium. As a member of the 1932 Indian squad, he also
had thrown the park's first pitch.

The Rockies become the fourth National League team, the only one this century,
not to record a shutout during the season. The other clubs to achieve

St. Louis Browns, the 1898 Washington Senators and the 1899 Cleveland Spiders.

The Mets score 5 in the 9th and beat the Marlins, 9-2. Dwight Gooden raises
his batting average to .200 with a pinch single in the 9th, while journeyman
Chico Walker ends his major league career with a 9th-inning 2-out solo homer
off the Marlins' Matt Turner. Walker will resurface as a replacement player
in 1995, but will be released by the Padres on March 30th. Chuck Carr has
his 58th stolen base to lead the NL.

Tommy Glavine outpitches David Nied and the Braves defeat the Rockies, 5-3,
thus becoming the first NL team this century to sweep a season series from
another team. Atlanta won all 13 contests between the 2 clubs and has won
104 overall.

The Royals defeat the Rangers, 4-1, in the final game at Arlington Stadium,
before a crowd of 41,039. The Rangers will move into their new stadium
next season.

Toronto's Joe Carter connects twice for homers in the 8-run 2nd inning as
the Jays beat the Orioles, 11-6. For the first time in 100 years, teammates
finish 1-2-3 in the race for the league batting title. Toronto's John Olerud
wins the crown with an average of .363, followed by Paul Molitor at .332
and Roberto Alomar at .326. Alomar is 3 for 4 in the game with 5 RBIs.

1995

in the 8th is enough to give the Indians a 2-1 victory.

record for their largest shutout win in 114 years. Fifteen players score
for the Braves, a new NL and ML record.

the bases loaded, Bucs reliever Brad Clontz bounces his 1st pitch past the
catcher to allow the winning run to score.

The Reds trim the Brewers, 7-1, to finish the year in a tie for the NL wild
card spot. They will play a one-game playoff tomorrow in Cincinnati.

It lasts just 5 innings, but the Cardinals (74-88) defeat the Cubs (67-95),
9-5, as both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa homer in their last game of the
season. McGwire takes Steve Trachsel deep in the 1st and finishes with 65
HRs, with Sosa next in line with 63, homering in the 3rd. McGwire's HR is
his 522nd moving him past Ted Williams and Willie McCovey for 10th place
on the All-Time list. He finishes with 147 RBIs on 145 hits, the first
player ever to have more ribbies than hits; Jay Buhner, in 1995, came
closest with 121 RBIs on 123 hits. Last year McGwire drove in 147 runs on
152 hits. Starter Luebbers earns the win for the Cards with just 4 innings
of work, a rarity. Rick Ankiel saves it after Luebbers pitches to 3 batters
in the 5th. More than 145,000 fans watched the 3-game set with the cubs,
giving the Cards a franchise-record 3,230,356 for 79 dates.

2000
The Cardinals defeat the Braves, 7-5, in the 1st game of their NL division
series. St. Louis scores 6 runs in the 1st inning off Greg Maddux, then hold
on as the Braves take advantage of rookie starter Rick Ankiel's wildness
to get back in the game. Ankiel sets a modern day major league record by
uncorking five wild pitches in the third inning of game 1 of the NLDS. He
joins Buffalo's Bert Cunningham who accomplished the same feat in the first
inning in a 1890 Players League contest.

The A's defeat the Yankees, 5-3, in the 1st game of their AL division
series. Catcher Ramon Hernandez hits a double off Roger Clemens in the 6th

new record for victories by a wild-card winner. The A's will end the season
with a 17-game home winning streak.

San Francisco again pounds the Astros, 11-8. Bonds has no homers, but walks
3 times and scores 3. His 171 walks is a new ML record, topping Ruth's 1923
base on balls mark. He'll finish with 177. The Astros lose for the 7th time
in 8 games.

Cubs ace Jon Lieber picks up his 20th win of the season, beating the Reds,
13-7. He's the first Cubs 20-game winner since Maddux, in 1992. Sosa hits
a 3-run HR for roundtripper No. 61, as the Cubs score 5 in the 7th. Sosa
pushes his RBI total to 154 to lead the majors. Corey Patterson has 4 hits
for Chicago while Corky Miller homers twice for the Reds. Cubs pitching
coach Oscar Acosta resigns from the organization, effective immediately
following the game and will take a job with Texas.

In arguably the latest trade ever, the Montreal Expos send Tim Raines to
Baltimore so that he can play with Tim Raines Jr, who made his debut on
October 1. Senior will play in four games, going 3 for 11 with a HR.

2002
The ax continues to drop as a total of six managers have been fired since
the end of the regular season three days ago. Jerry Royster (Brewers)
joins Bobby Valentine (Mets) and Jerry Narron (Rangers) who were dismissed
yesterday as well as Bruce Kimm (Cubs), Luis Pujols (Tigers) and Hal McRae
(Devil Rays) who were let go earlier in the week.

series. Mark Prior hurls a 2-hitter and outduels Greg Maddux.

2004
On the last day of the season, Blue Jays television announcer John Cerutti is
found dead in his SkyDome hotel room. The death of the 44-year-old Albany,
N.Y. native, who was a former big league pitcher, is due to natural causes
with foul play not being suspected.

At the site of the franchise's first National League game in 1969, the Expos,
who are scheduled to move to Washington D.C. next season, play their last
game in their 36-year history losing to the Mets at Shea Stadium, 8-1. Their
finale, which turns out to be the rubber match of the franchise series with
New York, gives the Amazin's a 299-298 advantage in the 597 contests played
since 1969.

2005
The ax begins to fall as two managers are fired the day after the season
ends. Jim Tracy (5-years/427-383) and Alan Trammell (3-years/186-300)
are fired by the Dodgers and Tigers respectively.

2006

in four years ago. Florida hires Braves third-base coach Fred Gonzalez to
replace first year skipper Joe Girardi, who had a well-publicized feud with
the owner during the season.

on the strength of a pair of HRs by Frank Thomas. Barry Zito gets the win
for Oakland.

for the victory. Curtis Granderson and Craig Monroe homer for Detroit.

The Cardinals win the opener of their NL Division Series against the Padres
by a score of 5-1. Cris Carpenter gets the win for St. Louis while Albert
Pujols hits a HR.

2007
After winning their tenth World Series campionship last season, the Cardinals
announce senior vice president and general manager Walt Jocketty (1,117 -
968, .536) will no longer have a role with the team. The former GM, who
will be replaced on an interim basis by his assisant John Mozeliak, watched
the Redbirds make seven postseason appearances, winning two National League
pennants and the 2006 Fall Classic, during his 13-year tenure with the club.

The construction for the $250 million renovation of Kauffman Stadium, which
will include the reduction of seating, the addition of an outfield concourse,
a team hall of fame and conference center, and a new HD scoreboard, begins
with a ceremonial groundbreaking inside the ballpark. The improvements,
scheduled to be completed by Opening Day in 2009, will keep the Royals in
Kansas City until 2030, a 15-year extension of their current deal.

2008
Jerry Manuel, who replaced Willie Randolph in June, inks a two-year deal
to manage the Mets. The likable 54-year-old skipper, who compiled a 55-38
record in his interim role, built a three-and-a-half game division lead
over Philadelphia in September, but like his predecessor, could not stop
the team from collapsing at the end of the season.

2009
Needing only a win or a Colorado loss for the past week, the Dodgers
finally clinch the National League West title with a 5-0 victory over the
the wild-card Rockies. Joe Torre, who will be managing in the postseason for
the 14th consecutive season, has won thirteen divisional titles, including
ten with the Yankees, one with the Braves, and now his second with LA.

2010
The Giants return to the playoffs for the first time in six years when they
beat the Padres on the last day of the season. After losing the first two
games of the week-end series to San Diego, San Francisco avoids ending the
season tied with their West Division foe with a 3-0 victory at AT&T Park.

Entering the final day of the season tied with the Yankees, the Rays win
their second AL East crown when their rivals lose to Boston. With the title
not in jeopardy, even with a loss due to their overall record against New
York this season, Tampa Bay rallies for a 3-2 victory over Kansas City in
12 innings to take the division by a game.

With an 8-7 victory over the Phillies, and a San Diego loss to San Francisco
later in the day, the Braves reach the postseason for the first time since
2005. Atlanta had won 14 straight division titles under skipper Bobby Cox, who
has announced his retirement for the end of the season, but this is the first
time the team has won the National League Wild Card in franchise history.

Josh Hamilton finished the regular season with a .359 average, the best in
franchise history, to become the third Ranger player to win an American
League batting crown. The Texas outfielder joins Julio Franco who hit
.341 in 1991, and Michael Young, who led the Junior Circuit in 2005 with
a batting average of .331.

According to Ken Macha, he will become the first managerial casualty in the
off season after hearing that the Brewers have decided not to pick up the
option on his contract for 2011. The 60-year-old skipper, who reached the
playoffs with Milwaukee two seasons ago as the NL Wild Card team, will be
told formally tomorrow in a meeting with general manager Doug Melvin.

With their 5-2 loss in Miami, the Pirates finish the season with a 17-64
record on the road. The Bucs' dismal away-from-home performance equals the
1963 Mets' infamous mark for a 162-game season.

2012
In the final game of the season with the AL West title on the line, Rangers
center fielder Josh Hamilton's fourth-inning error opens the floodgates
that allows the A's to erase a five-run deficit when they score six times
enroute to their 12-5 victory at the Oakland Coliseum. The Texas loss puts
the team into the new one-game AL Wild Card contest against Baltimore.

After getting off to a slow start in the regular-season finale against
Philadelphia, Teddy Roosevelt finally beats George, Abe and Tom to the
finish line, winning the Presidents Race for the first time since the
popular race made its debut at RFK Stadium in 2006. The victory, the
mascot's first in over 500 tries, is assured when a green furry creature,
who bears a striking resemblance to a phony Phillie Phanatic, waylays the
other three presidential contenders in right field.

Miguel Cabrera clinches the AL Triple Crown, becoming the first player to do
so since 1967, when Carl Yastzemski accomplished the feat with Boston. The
Tigers third baseman and eventual MVP led the circuit in average (.330),
homeruns (44) and RBIs (139) playing with the American League champs.

Fernando Rodney extends his franchise record to 48 saves when he is brought
in to face Jim Thome and gets the DH to hit a fly ball for the final out in
the Rays' 4-1 victory over Baltimore at Tropicana Field. The right-handed
closer, who has allowed only five earned runs over 74 2/3 innings, improves
his single-season record for the lowest ERA (0.60) by a reliever in baseball
history, bettering Dennis Eckersley's 0.61 mark established in 1990.

Adam Dunn, having struck out 222 times, doesn't play in the team's finale to
avoid the dubious distinction of breaking the major league mark for strike
outs in a season. The White Sox All-Star finishes with one less whiff than
Mark Reynolds' record, established by the first baseman in 2009 when he
played for the Diamondbacks.

2013
Alex Rodriguez announces he has filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme
Court, accusing Major League Baseball and Commissioner Bud Selig of pursuing
"vigilante justice" as part of a "witch hunt" in an effort to "destroy" his
reputation and career. On August 5, the Yankees star was given a 211-game
suspension for alleged violations of baseball's drug agreement.
