Oct 10

1903
Three days rest are apparently too much for Phillippe, who gives up
first-inning triples to Boston's Jimmy Collins and Chick Stahl for a 2-0
lead. Five of the first 11 hits are triples, as the ground rules call for
any balls hit into the crowds to be three baggers. Cy Young wins, 7-3.

1904
On the final day of the season, a doubleheader split will give the leading
Boston Americans the AL pennant over the Highlanders. 30,000 are on hand in
New York for the contests. With the score 2-2 in the top of the 9th and a
man on 3B, Jack Chesbro has a spitball get away from him for a wild pitch,
and Lou Criger scores Boston's winning run. Bill Dinneen then stops New
York in the 9th, hurling his 37th consecutive complete game of the season
for an AL mark. New York wins the 2nd game, chilling George Winter who goes
the route in a 1-0 loss to the Highlanders, but Boston triumphs by 1 1/2
games. The Boston pitchers achieve 148 complete games - an AL record. Both
leagues set marks for total complete games: AL 1,098, NL 1,089.

John McGraw issues a statement saying that he, not president John Brush, was
responsible for refusing to play the AL winner in a post season series. The
Sporting News will declare the Boston Americans champions by default.

1905
In game 2 of the WS at New York, Philadelphia's Chief Bender gives up a
mere 4 hits for a 3-0 win.

1906
The Cubs jump on Doc White early, and run (5 SBs) to a 7-1 victory. The
highlight of the game is Ed Reulbach's no-hit bid broken up by Jiggs
Donahue's single in the 7th. The next WS one-hitter will come in 1945,
by another Cub - Claude Passeau.

1907
Ed Reulbach coasts to a 5-1 win over the Tigers, as the Cubs hit 5 doubles
in game 3.

1908
In the WS Opener, Ed Reulbach, coasting with a 5-1 lead, tires in the
7th. Brown is unable to stop the Tigers from taking a 6-5 lead in the last
of the 8th. But the Cubs jump on reliever Ed Summers, a 24-game winner, for
6 straight hits and 5 runs in the 9th, and Brown gets the win, 10-6. For
umpire Bill Klem, it is the first of 15 WS he will officiate. Detroit's
Ira Thomas, batting for Charley O'Leary, hits the first WS pinch hit when
he singles in the 9th. There had been 12 previous pinch-hit attempts in WS
play, including the batter before Thomas.

1910
Playing for Sacramento (PCL), Frank Arellanes, who was 4-7 this year for
the Boston Red Sox, pitches a no-hitter against Vernon, but loses, 2-0.

1911
In Washington, the A's trip the AL All-Stars, 3-2, as Walter Johnson gives
up 10 hits in 9 innings. Coombs, Plank and Bender each allow one hit in
their 3 innings of tuneup.

1912
In game 3, New York evens the Series behind Rube Marquard, who blanks the
Red Sox until the 9th. A spectacular catch in deep LF by Josh Devore with
2 men on saves a 2-1 victory.

1913
The bottom of the Athletics batting order - Jack Barry, Wally Schang and Chief
Bender - drives in all the runs, as Bender wins his 4th straight WS game, 6-5.

1914
In game 2, Bill James and Eddie Plank match zeroes for 8. In the 9th, Boston's
Charlie Deal doubles, steals 3B and scores on Les Mann's single. James
gives up 2 hits.

1916
In game 3, Larry Gardener's 7th-inning HR over the RF fence at Brooklyn
brings the Sox within a run, 4-3, but Jeff Pfeffer, in relief of Jack Coombs,
shuts them down. Carl Mays takes the loss. Charlie Ebbets becomes the first
owner to raise the price of WS grandstand seats to $5 - up from $3.

1917
The White Sox are stifled by Rube Benton, who becomes the first lefty to
pitch a WS shutout. Dave Robertson, the NL's leading HR hitter with 12,
triples and scores the first of two 4th-inning runs for a 2-0 New York
win. Robertson will lead all batters in the Series with a .500 average.

1920
In the bottom of the first of an event-laden game, Brooklyn's Burleigh
Grimes gives up hits to Charlie Jamieson, Bill Wambsganss and Speaker. OF
Elmer Smith then hits the first grand slam in WS history, jumping on a
Grimes spitter in the opening inning. In the 3rd, P Jim Bagby comes up
with 2 on and crashes another Grimes delivery for a 3-run HR, the first
ever by a pitcher in WS play. Bagby is roughed up for 13 hits, but he gets
out of jams with the aid of 3 DPs and an unassisted triple play. In the
5th with Pete Kilduff on 2B and Otto Miller on 1B, relief pitcher Clarence
Mitchell hits a line drive at SS Wambsganss, who steps on 2B and tags the
off-and-running Miller before he can retreat. Cleveland dominates, 8-1.

1921
In game 5 an unearned run in the first is all the Giants can manage off Waite
Hoyt, despite 10 hits and a walk. A 1-1 game is decided in the 4th when Ruth
surprises the Giants IF with a perfect bunt, then makes it home on Meusel's
double off Art Nehf. Bob Meusel scores on a sacrifice fly, and 3-1 is the
result. The 35,758 spectators bring the players' pool to a record $302,522.23.

1923
It's an all-New York WS for the 3rd time. In the first WS game at Yankee
Stadium, the home team takes a quick 3-0 lead, but Heinie Groh triples in
2 runs in a 4-run 3rd that drives Waite Hoyt (17-9) to cover. A 4-4 tie
is broken in the top of the 9th by the Giants when Casey Stengel's blast
rolls to the OF wall. The sore-legged veteran hobbles around the bases
to score the winning run against reliever Joe Bush (19-15) before 55,307
spectators. This is also the first WS to be broadcast on a nationwide radio
network. Graham McNamee, aided by baseball writers taking turns, is at the
mike. Grantland Rice had broadcast an earlier WS, but not nationally.

1924
President and Mrs. Coolidge and 31,665 others thrill to the 2nd 3-hour battle
of the Series. Bucky Harris starts 23-year-old righthander Curly Ogden (9-8)
against Virgil Barnes (16-10), then pulls him after he fans Fred Lindstrom
and walks Frisch. In comes lefty George Mogridge (16-11), a move intended to
keep lefty Bill Terry on the Giants bench. Bucky Harris lifts one into the
temporary seats in LF for a 1-0 lead. In the 6th a single ties it at 1-1,
and Harris brings in Firpo Marberry for his 4th appearance. A base hit and 2
costly errors give the Giants a 3-1 lead. In the 8th, PH Nemo Liebold doubles
and C Muddy Ruel singles. A walk loads the bases and up comes Harris, who
hits a hard bounder to 3B that strikes a pebble and skips over Lindstrom's
head and down the LF line as the tying runs score. Walter Johnson, pitching
on one day's rest, then comes in to hold New York. With one out in the last
of the 12th, Giants reliever Jack Bentley gets Muddy Ruel to pop up near home
plate, but veteran C Hank Gowdy steps on his discarded mask, which he cannot
shake from his shoe, and the ball falls to the ground. Ruel then gets his 2nd
hit, a double. Walter Johnson reaches 1B on SS Travis Jackson's error. Earl
McNeely hits a grounder at Lindstrom, and improbably, the ball again takes a
bounce over his head. Ruel tears home with Washington's first WS championship.

1925
For game 3 it's clear but bitterly cold in Washington following a rainstorm
that caused the game to be rescheduled. President Coolidge throws out
the first ball. The Pirates hold a slim 3-2 lead after 6. A walk and 2
singles score 2 in the 8th for Washington, and Firpo Marberry (8-6) closes
it. Joe Harris has 2 hits for the 3rd time; he'll lead the Senators with
a .440 BA. Sam Rice makes a controversial game-saving play in the 8th,
tumbling into the stands in the right corner to spear a long drive by Earl
Smith. About 15 seconds later he emerges with the ball. Despite the Pirates'
arguments that a fan might have given it to him, ump Cy Rigler calls Smith
out. Questioned about it for the rest of his life, Rice leaves a letter,
to be opened after his death (in 1974), in which he states:  "At no time
did I lose possession of the ball."

1926
On a drizzling New York afternoon, only 38,093 show up at the Stadium for
the deciding WS contest. Grover Alexander, possibly sleeping off a hangover
in the bullpen, barely notices when Jess Haines takes a 3-2 lead over Waite
Hoyt into the 7th. Haines weakens in the last of the 7th; 3 walks put Earle
Combs, Bob Meusel, and Lou Gehrig on base with 2 out and Tony Lazzeri at the
plate. Hornsby then waves in Alexander. On a 1-1 count Lazzeri hits a line
drive into the left-field seats, a few feet to the foul side of the pole,
then swings and misses for strike 3. Alexander sets the Yanks down in order
until Babe Ruth draws his 11th walk with 2 out in the 9th, and is thrown out
inexplicably trying to steal 2B. The Cards and St. Louis have their first
World Championship. Each winner collects $5,584.51, the losers $3,417.75.

1930
The New York Yankees announce they have signed Joe McCarthy to manage the
team for 4 years. The Cubs made him available one year after he had led them
to a pennant, and the Yankees lost no time in signing him. McCarthy will lead
New York to 8 pennants and 7 World Championships before resigning in 1946.

With no MVP award for the second year in a row, the Associated Press
polls its members and names Joe Cronin the unofficial AL MVP for 1930. The
Baseball Writers Association names Hack Wilson the MVP of the NL. The Cubs
give Wilson a bonus of $1,000, the monetary reward that the MVP title had
carried as an official league honor.

1931
Connie Mack sends George Earnshaw out to win the final game as he had in
1930. However, Burleigh Grimes carries a 4-0 lead into the 9th before he
weakens. The A's score twice and have 2 runners on base with 2 outs when
Bill Hallahan rescues Grimes. Max Bishop lines out to Pepper Martin for
the final out as the Cardinals take the Series 4 games to 3. As in the
1929 and 1930 WS, the A's finish the 1931 WS with no stolen bases ...
Martin steals 5 for the Cards.

1932
The Giants get C Gus Mancuso from the Cards for 4 players, including veteran
Bob O'Farrell.

1933
Joe Cronin is rewarded with a 3-year contract as player-manager of the
Senators.

1935
In New York, the Giants file suit asking for a restraining order to prevent
bootleg broadcasts of all sporting events from the Polo Grounds. Long opposed
to having their games on the radio, the suit is brought against several
broadcasting companies. The Giants admit that "the method of acquiring the
simultaneous description of baseball games is unknown."

1937
Lefty Gomez wins again, and the Yankees wrap up the Series. Gomez himself
knocks in the winning run in the 4-2 clincher. It is a record 5th WS win,
without a loss, for Gomez. Another record comes as the Yankees complete
the Series without an error.

1938
Burleigh Grimes is dismissed as Dodgers manager. Leo Durocher will be named
as his replacement in 2 days.

1939
Ted Lyons pitches a 7th-game win for the White Sox in their City Series
with the Cubs. The loser is Earl Whitehill. It is Lyons' second five-hit
win as the series ends, as it started, under the lights at Comiskey.

1943
Marius Russo, of little use during the season, pitches and bats the Yankees
to a 2-1 win. He allows just 7 hits and his double knocks in the winner.

1945
The Tigers tally 5 runs in the first inning and rout the Chicago Cubs, 9-3,
behind Hal Newhouser, who strikes out 10, enabling Detroit to win baseball's
most sloppy World Series, 4 games to 3. The winners get $6,433 a share,
2nd to the 1937 Yankees' share. Each Cub gets $3,930. Total receipts of
$1.6 million is a WS record.

1946
Enos Slaughter, Whitey Kurowski and Joe Garagiola each have 4 hits, and
Al Brazle pitches a 12-3 complete-game win. The Cards tie a WS record by
racking up 20 hits.

1948
The largest crowd ever to attend a World Series game, 86,288 fans jam into
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium to witness a showdown between two future Hall
of Famers. Braves southpaw Warren Spahn beats Bob Feller and the Indians
in game 5 of the Fall Classic, 11-5. A 6-run 7th kayos Bob Feller and 2
successors for the victory. Bob Elliott has 2 HRs, one for 3 runs. The
crowd size will be exceeded in the LA Coliseum in 1959.

1950
The Chicago White Sox hire Seattle Rainiers (PCL) manager Paul Richards
as their manager for 1951 ushering in the era of the "Go Go" Sox. Chicago,
which stole an ML-low 19 bases in 1950, will top the majors next year with 99.

1951
In game 6 of the Fall Classic, the Yankees become World Champions for the
14th time in franchise history and third straight when they beat the Giants,
4-3. The Bronx Bombers' big blow is a three-run triple hit by Hank Bauer off
Dave Koslo in the sixth inning. Just before the game, Leo Durocher turns
over a letter he received to Ford Frick that offers the Giants manager a
$15,000 bribe "if the Giants manage to lose the next 3 games."

1956
In game 7, the Yankees win their first WS championship in 3 years as Johnny
Kucks sets down the Bums, 9-0. Yogi Berra hits a pair of 2-run HRs and Bill
Skowron hits a grand slam, a first in WS history. There won't be another
player hitting a grand slam in a game with a player hitting 2 homers until
1998. Don Newcombe takes the loss, his 4th in Series competition.

1957
With a 5-0 victory over the defending World Champions in game 7 at Yankee
Stadium, Milwaukee wins its first World Series championship since the
'Miracle Braves' won the title in 1914 representing Boston. The Most Valuable
Player of the Fall Classic is right-hander Lew Burdette, who hurled three
complete game victories, including today's shutout (on two day's rest). The
30-year-old right-hander tosses 24 consecutive scoreless innings and posts
a 0.64 ERA in his three Fall classic victories.

1960
Bill Mazeroski stars again. His 2-run double stakes Harvey Haddix to a 3-0
lead. Roy Face is called on once more for another hitless effort to preserve
a 5-2 win for a 3-2 WS lead for the surprising Pirates.

1961
An expansion draft to stock the new NL clubs takes place in
Cincinnati. Selecting 1st, Houston takes Giants SS Eddie Bressoud; the Mets
take 31-year-old Giant C Hobie Landrith. Second choices are Bob Aspromonte
(45s) and Elio Chacon. Other Houston selections include Bobby Shantz,
Ken Johnson, Dick Farrell and Bob Lillis. New York takes Roger Craig,
Gil Hodges, Don Zimmer, Gus Bell and Jay Hook, among others. Also, Cards
C Chris Cannizzaro, out much of this year due to an appendectomy.

Billy Hitchcock takes the place of Lum Harris (17-10) as manager of the
Orioles.

1962
Tom Tresh belts an eighth-inning homer off Jack Sanford to give the Yankees
a 5-3 comeback win over the Giants in game 5 of the World Series played in
soggy San Francisco. The rookie shortstop's dad, Mike Tresh, who hit only
two homeruns in his dozen big league seasons, prior to the at-bat left his
seat behind home plate and moved to the standing-room section in Candlestick
Park hoping to bring his son good luck. Ralph Terry gets the win.

1963
The Mets announce the club has 'traded' coaches with the Giants bringing Wes
Westrum to New York in exchange for Cookie Lavagetto, who is recovering from
a serious illness and asked to be moved nearer to his home in Oakland. Mets
manager Casey Stengel met and became fond of his new coach during the recent
All-Star game, and will be replaced by him as the team's second skipper in
franchise history when the 75-year-old 'Old Professor' retires in 1965.

The Mets take 1B Bill Haas from the Dodgers and P Jack Fisher from the Giants,
while Houston grabs P Claude Raymond from the Braves in a supplemental
draft for the expansion teams. In the draft, each of the 8 original clubs
was required to make available 4 players from their roster of August 31st
(the Reds list 5 players). Houston and the Mets can pay $30,000 for each of
the players chosen. Haas will never reach the majors, and the two pitchers
chosen will make contributions ... the other players go unchosen. Paul
Richards, Houston GM, who had originated the idea of the draft, had second
thoughts after seeing the players made available.

1964
At Yankee Stadium, after Jim Bouton and Curt Simmons battle to a 1-1 tie
through 8 innings, Mickey Mantle slams the first pitch of the bottom of
the ninth inning out of the Bronx ballpark giving New York a dramatic 2-1
walk-off victory and a two-games-to-one advantage over the Cardinals in
the the Fall Classic. 'The Mick's' game-winning round-tripper off Barney
Schultz makes him the fifth major leaguer to end a World Series game with a
homerun. It is Mick's 16th Fall Classic round-tripper, breaking the previous
mark set by Babe Ruth.

1965
In game 4 Don Drysdale evens the WS with a 5-hit 7-2 win. Wes Parker and
Lou Johnson hit HRs, as the Dodgers beat Jim Grant.

outfielders Mack Jones and Jim Beauchamp.

1968
Cardinal fireballer Bob Gibson sets the mark for total strikeouts (35)
in a World Series, but loses the seventh and deciding game to the Tigers,
4-1. In the fifth inning, Dal Maxvill pops out to first base becoming
the first major leaguer to go 0 for 22 in the Fall Classic. The Cardinal
shortstop surpasses the single series infamous mark previously shared by
Gil Hodges (1952 - Dodgers), Red Murray (1911 - Giants), Billy Sullivan
(1906 - White Sox) and Jimmy Sheckard (1906 - Cubs). Mickey Lolich brings
Detroit its first WS championship since 1945 hurling a 5-hitter.

1969
In his final season, P Masaichi Kaneda of the Yomiuri Giants gets his 400th
lifetime win against 250 losses. During a 20-year career (1950-69), he won
30 games twice and 20 games 14 times. He also holds the Japanese record for
strikeouts (4,490), averaging 225 a season, while giving up only 1,809 walks.

Yutaka Enatsu of the Hanshin Tigers strikes out his 401st batter of the
season. This puts him 3rd on the all-time list after Matt Kilroy with 513
in 1886 and Old Hoss Radbourn with 441 in 1884.

1970

2003
With six hits in six consecutive at-bats, Kenny Lofton sets a NLCS record
and ties the ALCS mark. Gary Matthews (Phillies - 1983), Will Clark (Giants
- 1989), Steve Buechele (Pirates - 1991) and Javy Lopez (Braves - 1996) all
held the previous NL distinction with five consecutive hits and Paul Molitor
(Blue Jays - 1993) established the major league standard, now shared with

2005
Although the Phillies (88-74) have had three straight winning seasons and

is fired as the team's general manager. Philadelphia has not played in the
post-season for 12 consecutive years, including the last eight seasons with
Wade calling the shots.

Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park.

2009
The Dodgers advance to their second consecutive National League championship
series beating St. Louis, 5-1, to complete a three-game sweep of the Redbirds
in the NLDS. Solid pitching by late-season pick-up Vicente Padilla and timely
hitting by Andre Ethier, who had three extra-base hits, and Manny Ramirez,
who broke out of slump with three hits and two RBIs, closes out the series
which will be best remembered for the team's dramatic game 2 comeback when
Matt Holliday's error on James Loney's ninth-inning two-out line drive leads
to a stunning two-run walk-off rally. In Holliday's first at-bat at home since
his critical error, the Cardinals' left fielder receives a standing ovation
from the sellout crowd of 47,296 at Busch Stadium. The former NLCS MVP award
winner (Colorado - 2007), who will become a free agent after the season,
is touched by the fans' reaction and very appreciative of their support.

2010
Behind the solid starting pitching of Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt and Cole
Hamels, the Phillies complete the franchise's first playoff sweep when
Hamels throws a complete-game five-hit 2-0 NLDS victory over the Reds at
Great American Ball Park. Philadelphia will have an opportunity to become
the first team to win three consecutive National League pennants since the
war-time Cardinals raised flags from 1942 to 1944.

2011

league playoff history when his 11th-inning round-tripper beats Detroit,

advantage in the seven-game series.
