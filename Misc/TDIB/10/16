1909
Rookie Babe Adams comes through with a 6-hit 8-0 win. It is his 3rd
complete-game WS victory and gives the Pirates their first World
Championship. He is the only rookie this century to win a game 7 in
the WS. The next to do it will be John Lackey, in 2002. Clarke walks 4
times, and Wagner and Miller each drive in 2 runs. The 2 teams combine
for a WS-record 34 errors, with Detroit contributing 19, also a record.
Pittsburgh wins its second Fall Classic in franchise history.

1910
Ban Johnson, American League president, declares Tigers outfielder Ty
Cobb the league's batting champ after questioning Nap Lajoie's suspicious
eight-hit performance in a doubleheader against the Browns.

At Portland, Los Angeles (PCL) beats the Beavers, 3-2 and 1-0 in 5 innings. In
game 1, when Angels' Pete Daley scores in the 4th inning, it is the first
score against Portland in 88 innings. Portland will finish atop the PCL
with a 113-79 record and four 20-game winners.

1911
The World Series resumes today, Monday, and the pitchers continue to
dominate. Rube Marquard and Eddie Plank are in command of a 1-1 game when
Philadelphia's Eddie Collins doubles in the last of the 6th and Frank Baker
hits one over the RF fence for a 3-1 victory.

At Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Browns whip the Cardinals, 5-1, to
sweep the City series with five wins. The first game ended in a scoreless tie.

1912
In the Series finale, Mathewson squares off against Hugh Bedient in quest
of his first win of the Series. He takes a 1-0 lead into the 7th, but with
one out, Boston manager Jake Stahl hits a pop-up to short LF. The ball
drops among Art Fletcher, Josh Devore and Fred Snodgrass. Heinie Wagner
walks, and with 2 outs, pinch hitter Olaf Henriksen doubles home the tying
run. Smoky Joe Wood relieves Bedient, and the 2 aces match zeroes until
"Red" Murray doubles and Merkle singles in the 10th to give New York a 2-1
lead. In the last of the 10th, pinch hitter Clyde Engle lifts a can of corn
to CF Snodgrass, who drops the ball. Snodgrass then makes a great catch of
a long drive by Harry Hooper. Steve Yerkes walks, bringing up Tris Speaker,
who pops a high foul along the 1B line. C Chief Meyers chases it, but it drops
a few feet from 1B Merkle, who could have taken it easily. Reprieved, Speaker
then singles in the tying run and sends Yerkes to 3B. After Duffy Lewis is
walked intentionally, 3B Larry Gardner hits a long sac fly to a retreating
Devore that scores Yerkes with the winning run. This World Series was the
most butterfingered in history, with thirty-one errors recorded, seventeen
for The Giants. As noted by Bob Timmermann, in the game writeup in the New
York Times, the paper refers to the World Series as starting in 1884, not
1903. The Red Sox earn $4,024.68 each; the Giants' share is $2,566.47 each.

bonus for a job well done.

for 600 soldiers at Garden City, NY. The Sox win, 6-4.

1921
In defiance of a Landis ban on WS participants playing post-season
exhibitions, Ruth, Bob Meusel and P Bill Piercy launch a barnstorming tour
in Buffalo. Five days later, they cut it short in Scranton. In the meantime
Ruth openly challenges Landis to act. The judge does, fining the players their
WS shares - $3,362.26 - and suspending them until May 20th of the next season.

Judge Landis outlaws gentleman's agreements and cover-ups of players optioned
to the minors without proper paperwork. He declares 6 players free agents,
including Heinie Manush, who will ride a 17-year .330 BA into the Hall of
Fame in 1964.

1923
Soon after Babe Ruth receives his WS winner's share of $6,160.46, insurance

sells him a $50,000 life insurance policy. Beneficiaries are Mrs. Ruth and
adopted daughter Dorothy.

will return to off-season oil and real estate businesses in Houston.

1951
In a letter written to ML officials, St. Louis Browns P Ned Garver offers
a pay plan that would ameliorate the ill effects of the reserve system he
supports. He would have the salaries of players on consistent tail-enders be
determined by a rating system by the owners. If the club does not match the
"average" salary, then that player should be traded to some other club that
can afford his services. Garver adds that he "doesn't care where I play,
as long as I get a 'fair' salary."

1957
Bill Rigney, the club's current skipper and an Alameda native, is named
to be the first manager of the San Francisco Giants, when his contract is
extended for two more seasons. The former franchise infielder replaced Leo
Durocher in 1956 while the team still played in New York.

In Cleveland, Hank Greenberg is fired by the owners of the Indians. Greenberg,
one of the architects of the strong Cleveland teams of the early 1950s,
will be replaced by Frank "Trader" Lane, but will continue as a minority
shareholder in the team.

1961

Veteran pitcher Billy Loes is purchased by the Mets.

1962

DP. In the 9th, with 2 outs and Matty Alou on 1B, Willie Mays rips a double
to right off Ralph Terry, but great fielding by Roger Maris keeps Alou
from scoring. Willie McCovey then hits a screaming liner toward right,
but 2B Bobby Richardson gloves it, giving the Yankees a 1-0 win and a 2nd
straight WS victory (20th overall). Terry is named WS MVP.

1964
The Board of Directors of the Indians votes to keep the club in Cleveland.

The day after the final game of the World Series, the managerial posts
of both pennant winning teams are vacant. In the morning, Johnny Keane,
manager of the victorious St. Louis Cardinals, resigns, much to the surprise
of owner Gussie Busch. Hours later, New York Yankee general manager Ralph
Houk fires Yogi Berra as his manager, citing Berra's lack of control over
the team and his inability to command respect from his players. Less than a
week later, Houk replaces Berra with Keane. Meanwhile, Berra reunites with
Casey Stengel as a coach with the New York Mets.

1969
In game 5 Cleon Jones, awarded 1B when shoe polish on the ball proves he was
hit by a pitch, scores on Donn Clendenon's HR. Al Weis' HR an inning later

1976
In game 1 of the World Series against the Yankees, Dan Driessen, batting
fifth in the Reds line-up, becomes the first National League player to be
used as a designated hitter. The DH was not employed prior to this year's
Fall Classic, although the concept had been adopted and used in the American
League since 1973. Don Gullett and Pedro Borbon combine on a 5-hitter, as
the Reds win, 5-1, over the Yankees. Three hits by Perez and a Joe Morgan
homer supply the offense.

a homerun, is the Series MVP.

is hired again.

1985
In game 6 of the NLCS, Cardinal first baseman Jack Clark's dramatic
come-from-behind two-out three-run homerun in the ninth inning (with 1B
open) stuns a sold-out Dodger Stadium. St. Louis wins the game, 7-5, and
captures the National League flag.

Coming back from a 3 to 1 game deficit, the Royals capture their first
American League pennant beating the Blue Jays in game 7 of the ALCS,
6-2. Dick Howser's squad will go on to beat the Cardinals to win the
franchise's first World Series championship.

homers in the 8th for the Braves' 2 runs. P Rick Reed shuts out Atlanta
over the first 7 innings on a single hit.

drives home 5 runs. Garciaparra, Valentin and Brian Daubach all homer for
the Sox. New York now leads the ALCS, 2-games-to-1. The dream pitching duel
between Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens doesn't materialize when the 'Rocket'
fails to get out of the third inning giving up five earned runs on six hits.

2000

Red Sox and their 39th AL pennant. Boston blows a 4-0 lead as New York
comes back to score 3 runs in the 8th off tired starter Pedro Martinez
to tie the score. Sox manager Little's decision to stay with Pedro will
cost him his job. Jason Giambi hits a pair of HRs for NY, while ALCS Most
Valuable Player Mariano Rivera hurls 3 innings in relief for the win. Boone

three-year contract worth approximately $10 million which has an option
for a fourth year to manage the Cubs. The 64-year-old fiery skipper, who
is replacing Dusty Baker (66-96), has a record of 1,519-1,420 during his
