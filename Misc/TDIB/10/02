Oct 2

1902
In the Giants' 2-1 loss at Boston, there is one stolen base but eight
runners are caught trying to steal (as noted by Cliff Blau). In addition,
three runners are picked off base (although one manages to advance thanks to
an error) and two more are thrown out at the plate. Ed Gremminger scores the
winning run in the 14th inning, beating the throw from Giants third baseman,
Billy Lauder, who had fielded Pat Moran's grounder. Roger Bresnahan is ejected
from the game for arguing after he was caught trying to steal third with two
outs. With all these lost runners, and with the help of three double plays,
Luther Taylor nearly gets away with yielding 9 walks.

1903
The Boston Americans' Bill Dinneen blanks Pittsburgh, 3-0, on 3 hits and 11
strikeouts to even the Series. His 4 starts will give him 3 victories, making
this the only WS to produce two 3-game winners. Boston LF Patsy Dougherty hits
2 HRs; in 14 WS games they are the only HRs he will hit. With Boston electing
to bat first, Patsy's first homer is a leadoff blast against Sam Leever.

1904
Doc White's scoreless streak ends at 45 innings when the New York Highlanders
score in the first. White then pitches another 8 shutout innings to win, 7-1.

1905
The Washington outfield has no putouts or assists in a 3-2 win over Chicago.

1906
In St. Louis, the White Sox shut out the Browns, 6-0, behind Frank Owen's 7th
shutout of the year. It is the 32nd shutout for the White Sox, a ML record
that will not be topped. The Cubs will tie it in 1907 and again in 1909.

1907
At Pittsburgh, rookie George McQuillan pitches the Philadelphia Phillies into
3rd place in the NL with a 4-1 victory. The Pittsburgh Pirates' score comes
in the first inning, the first tally off McQuillan after 25 straight scoreless
innings. The New York Giants drop to 4th place with a 13-7 loss at Chicago.

Detroit sweeps a pair from Washington, winning 9-5 and 10-2. Ty Cobb's
200th hit earns him a $500 bonus; he will get 212 for the year.

1908
On the last day of the season, in a great pitching duel, Ed Walsh is almost
perfect, giving up 4 hits and striking out 15 in 8 innings, but Cleveland's
Addie Joss is perfect, setting down 27 straight White Sox for a 1-0 victory
in the heat of the pennant race. The only run scores on a passed ball by
Ossee Schreckengost. It is the high point of Joss' career. He will finish
24-12 with a 1.16 ERA. Cleveland center fielder Joe Birmingham scored the
game's only run. It is perhaps the finest pitching duel in baseball history.

In Detroit, the Tigers score two runs in the 9th to edge the Browns, 7-6. Cobb
scores the winning run, but is practically carried across the plate by Hugh
Jennings. Cobb had been held at 3B by the umpire who believed Rossman's
double had gone into the crowd. Cobb argued that it had not, and Jennings
later reminded Cobb to, "score first, argue later." The Tigers remain in
first by a half-game.

Otis Clymer hits for the cycle to pace the Washington Senators to a 12-2
pasting of New York.

The Pirates take over first by a half-game by sweeping the Cardinals in
St. Louis. Lefty Leifield wins the opener, 7-4, and Howie Camnitz wins the
nitecap, 2-1, on homers by Honus Wagner and George Gibson. Only 2 points
separate New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh, as each team takes a turn on
top during the final week.

1909
Eddie Grant of the Phils is 7 for 7 against the Giants' Rube Marquard
and Christy Mathewson, as the Phils sweep two, 9-2 and 2-1. Marquard is
clobbered in the opener, allowing 16 hits and 9 runs, and George McQuillan
outpitches Mathewson in the nitecap for a 2-1 victory. Mathewson ends the
season with an ERA of 1.14 and a career-high winning percentage of .806.

In the first game of a season-ending doubleheader against Washington, Jim
Curry plays second base for the Athletics and goes 1 for 4 against Walter
Johnson. At 16 years six months 22 days, Curry is the youngest player in
American League history and the youngest major league position player in
the 20th century (his birth year is reported as both 1889 and 1893). Carl
Scheib will debut at 16 years of age in 1943. Walter Johnson's 6-5 loss in
the opener seals the last-place finish for Washington with 110 losses -
Johnson and Bob Groom suffering 51 of them. The A's take the nitecap as
well, 7-2. Three years later, when Washington rises to 2nd place, Johnson
and Groom will combine for 56 wins. Today, Groom and P Dolly Gray play the
outfield for the Senators. The last place finish costs Pongo Joe Cantillon
his job. The new manager is Jimmy McAleer.

In Kansas City, former Cubs catcher Johnny Kling wins the world championship
of pool, defeating Cowboy Weston, 800 to 789. Kling was ahead in each
of the four days of play. He runs 198 straight balls today while Weston,
the defending champion, runs 208 straight.

In an exhibition game in Chicago, the NL Colts lose, 7-3, to the colored
Leland Giants at Gunther Park. Merz, with no ML record, is the loser as
all the regulars rest. In the second game, the Giants play the Gunthers,
winning, 8-4.

1910
The pennant-bound Cubs end the season with an 8-4 win over the Reds, pulling
off a triple play in the process. The TP goes left fielder Jimmy Sheckard
to C Johnny Kling to 1B Jimmy Archer.

1912
In the fight for 2nd place, Chicago tops the Pirates, 6-5, despite Cubs C Dick
Cotter batting out of turn. Cotter knocks in the tying run in the 9th and
the winning run in the 10th, the latter while hitting out of turn. Pirates
manager Fred Clarke doesn't realize it until the game is over, but then
protests. The teams agree that an infraction occurred and reschedule the
game on their own; their actions are later upheld by NL President Lynch.

1913
The Giants and Phils wrap up the season with 7 games in 3 days. The August
30th game, called in the 9th, is completed for an 8-6 Phillie victory. The
following doubleheader is split. Tomorrow the Giants will win one and tie
one. The day after they will win both.

1914
In Boston, the Yankees make 5 errors to help Red Sox rookie Babe Ruth win,
11-5. Ruth, just recalled from Providence, makes his first ML hit, a double,
off King Cole.

Phil Douglas gives up just one hit - a single to Honus Wagner - but 2
walks and 2 errors in the 8th are his undoing. The Reds lose, 2-1 to the
Pirates. For Wagner, it is the 3rd game in his career where he's had the
only hit. This is the 3rd one-hit loss this year; two occurred in July.

1915
In the first of two games, Walter Johnson gives Washington a 3-1 win over
the Red Sox. Ruth pitches the final 3 innings, allowing one Nats hit.

The Queens Bombers? At the Waldorf Astoria, the National Commission
meets. During the sessions Colonels Ruppert of the Yankees and Ebbets of
the Dodgers meet regarding a possible new home for the Yankees, and Ebbets
withdraws his objections to the Yankees moving to Queens. They are considering
a stadium near the 59th Street Bridge. Nothing is final and the New York
Times also mentions two sites in Manhattan that the team is considering.

1916
Grover Cleveland Alexander 3-hits the 3rd-place Braves for a 2-0 Philley
win, his 33rd, and his record 16th shutout. He has thrown 28 shutouts in
the last two seasons. But Boston takes the nitecap, 4-1, when Milt Stock,
Bancroft's replacement at short, makes a costly error.

1917
At Boston the Red Sox and Senators divide a doubleheader, Washington
winning, 9-7 in 10 innings, then losing, 2-1 in 8 innings. Shanks has 4 of
the 15 Nats hits off Dutch Leonard in the first game as Doc Ayers wins in
relief. Ayers and Carl Mays, both after bonus money, duel in the 2nd game,
with Mays emerging the richer.

In the nitecap of two games at the Baker Bowl, Pete Alexander downs the
Series-bound Giants, 8-2, for his 30th win. Alex adds two doubles in winning
his last game ever in a Phils uniform. The Quakers will sell the star to
the Cubs in December. In the opener, a 5-2 NY win, the Giants' Jesse Barnes,
a lifetime .214 hitter, walks twice in an inning, the only pitcher ever to
do so.

1919
In game 2 after an easy 3 innings, Lefty Williams walks 3 Reds, gives up a
single to Edd Roush and a triple to Larry Kopf, and the Reds lead, 3-0. Slim
Sallee scatters 10 hits as Risberg and Gandil fail in the clutch. The final
score is 4-2. Joe Jackson has 3 hits; his .375 BA will make it appear later
that he was trying.

Charles Comiskey tells NL president Heydler that Sox manager Kid Gleason is
suspicious of his players. Heydler confers with Ban Johnson, who takes no
action, fearing it will look like revenge against Comiskey, with whom he
has been feuding. As the games unfold, reporters Ring Lardner and Christy
Mathewson do not like what they see. Chicago reporter Hugh Fullerton
will raise questions during the winter. Comiskey will offer a reward for
information, but the 1920 season will open with the same lineup for Chicago,
minus Chick Gandil, who will be in the PCL.

1920
Jim Bagby wins his 31st game, clinching the pennant for the Indians with a
10-1 win over the Tigers. Tris Speaker contributes 3 hits to finish the year
at .388, 2nd to George Sisler's .407. The Sox' 10-7 victory over the Browns
is not needed by the Indians. The Indians' victory is due primarily to a .303
team BA (the Browns lead the league at .308) and the pitching of Jim Bagby,
31-12, Stan Coveleski, 24-14, and Ray Caldwell, 20-10. A big boost came from
Duster Mails, brought up from the Pacific Coast League at the end of August,
who won 7 without a loss on a 1.85 ERA. Despite the heavy hitting in the AL,
there are ten 20-game winners; the White Sox have 4 of them - Red Faber,
Eddie Cicotte, Dickie Kerr and Lefty Williams.

With the last two games rained out, fans get their money's worth in Pittsburgh
as the Pirates and Reds, battling to determine 3rd place, play the century's
only tripleheader. Starting at noon, the Reds win the first, 13-4, to clinch
3rd place. The Reds win game 2 as well, 7-3, with a number of players at
odd positions ... they put catcher Ivy Wingo at 2B, with pitchers Bressler,
Ruether, Coumbe and Eller at field positions. The Pirates take the finale,
6-0, called after 6 innings because of darkness. The only "tribill" played
this century is played in 5 hours. Clyde Barnhart, who made his major league
debut ten days earlier, doubles in the first two games, and singles in the
3rd, the only player to hit in all three games. Peter Harrison is the home
plate umpire for all three games.

Shaken by the possible effects of the scandal surrounding baseball, club
owners begin a series of meetings to reform the game. Albert D. Lasker,
a Chicago advertising man and minority stockholder of the Cubs, proposes
a 3-man board of non baseball men, with the chairman to be paid $25,000
per year. Among the names mentioned:  Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, former
President William Howard Taft, General George Pershing, Senator Hiram Johnson,
General Leonard Wood and ex-treasury secretary William McAdoo.

1921
The Yankees close the season by beating the Red Sox, 7-6. Ruth hits No. 59,
off Curt Fullerton; for the team it is No. 134. Stuffy McInnis completes
his 119th consecutive errorless game at 1B (1300 chances), and Boston SS
Everett Scott plays his 832nd consecutive game, a team record that will not
be approached this century. The previous Red Sox mark was held by Buck Freeman
(535) and Frank Malzone will accumulate the next highest with 475 games.

At Philadelphia, Walter Johnson coasts to an 11-6 win over the A's and Roy
Moore. Johnson gives up a 6th-inning solo homer to Jimmy Dykes, his 17th
homer of the year.

1923
In a 7-5 Detroit win over the White Sox, Harry Heilmann goes 2 for 2 to
put his average over .400. He will sit for the rest of the season, except
for a pinch single on the final day, and will win the batting title with a
.403 average. Cobb helps out today with a steal of home in the 7th inning,
his first steal of home in more than three years.

1925
In Pete Alexander's toughest game of the year, the Cubs' veteran battles
for 19 innings with White Sox hurler Ted Blankenship, before the City Series
game is called at 2-2.

The A's roll over the 7th-place Yankees, 10-0, in Philadelphia behind Stan
Baumgartner. Rookie Leo Durocher makes his debut as a pinch hitter in the
8th against Baumgartner. The Lip flies out. For the veteran Baumgartner,
it is his last ML appearance. Jimmy Dykes is 5 for 5 for the A's, with a
triple and a homer, hitting the first pitch each time. Four of his hits
are off Garland Braxton.

The Senators close out the season with a 3-1 win over the Red Sox. Ted
Wingfield is the victor. Washington's Firpo Marberry finishes the season
with 55 mound appearances, all in relief. He becomes the first exclusive
relief hurler appearing in more than 40 games and launches a growing trend
that will extend to the present day.

1926
Game 1 of the WS before 61,658 at New York belongs to southpaws Herb Pennock
(25-11) and Bill Sherdel (16-12). Two hits give the Cards a quick first-inning
run. Sherdel issues 3 walks for a New York run without a hit. In the 6th,
Babe Ruth slaps a single to left, moves to 2B on a sacrifice, and scores
on a Lou Gehrig single for a 2-1 win. It is the first of Gehrig's record
8 game-winning RBIs in WS play.

1927
The Phils beat the A's, 1-0, for the benefit of the Eddie Plank Memorial Fund.

The Tigers take a pair from the Indians, winning 11-5 and 5-4. Heilmann slams
2 homers, 3 doubles and 2 singles. With the batting title in his pocket, he
chooses to play the 2nd game. His 7 for 9 puts him at .398 to Athletics Al
Simmons' .392. It is the 4th time he will win an alternate-year championship.

Helped by 5 errors, the Senators down the A's, 9-5. A's 3B Jimmy Dykes pitches
the 8th inning for Philley and gives up an unearned run on OF Rusty Saunders'
second error of the game. Saunders also plays basketball for Washington's
pro team. Rookie Babe Ganzel, son of 19th century star Chick, has 4 hits,
including a double and a triple, to pace the Nats. Babe, who debuted on
September 19, hits .438 this year in 13 games, but will go .077 in 10 games
and be dropped.

1930
Flint Rhem is a surprise starter for the Cardinals but he fails to astonish
the Athletics batters. He gives up 6 earned runs in less than 4 innings,
all the Athletics need to win, 6-1, behind George Earnshaw's 6-hit
pitching. Mickey Cochrane for the A's and George Watkins for St. Louis
hit homers.

1931
The Cards even the WS as Wild Bill Hallahan shuts out the A's, 2-0, despite 7
walks and a wild pitch. Pepper Martin continues to steal the Series, scoring
from 2B on a base hit in the 2nd inning and sliding in a cloud of dust on
a squeeze play in the 8th. He has 2 stolen bases and scores two runs, but
the game almost gets away on a bonehead play by the usually savvy Cardinal C
Jimmy Wilson. With 2 on base in the 9th and 2 outs, PH Johnny Moore swings
at a ball in the dirt and misses. Wilson needs only to throw the ball to
1B. Instead, he throws it to 3B, and everyone is safe. Fortunately for
Wilson's reputation, Jim Bottomley makes a sensational catch, leaning into
the box seats to get the final out on a pop foul by Max Bishop.

1932
At Wrigley Field, the demoralized Cubs lose, 13-6, as the Yankees sweep the
Series, winning their ML-record 12th straight WS game. Tony Lazzeri hits 2
HRs, and Earle Combs, one. Wilcy Moore gets the win in relief. Combs ties
a WS record with 4 runs scored, and Bill Dickey ties another with 6 at-bats.

1935
The WS opens in Detroit and Lon Warneke, the Cubs' ace, shuts out the Tigers
and Schoolboy Rowe, 3-0. Augie Galan has two ribbies and Hartnett one.

1936
The Yankees score a WS-record 18 runs, as they demolish the Giants,
18-4. Lefty Gomez coasts to a 6-hit win, while every member of the Yankees
lineup makes a hit and scores at least one run. Lazzeri hits a grand slam,
the first in WS play since 1920, and drives in 5 runs, the same number Bill
Dickey drives home. This runs-scored-mark will stand until 1993.

1937
Thirty-four-year-old rookie Jim Turner of the Boston Bees wins his 20th game,
7-1, over the Phillies. Tomorrow, fellow first-year pitcher Lou Fette, 30,
will also win his 20th, against the Phils.

The Yankees (101-52) close out the season with an 11-3 pasting of the Red
Sox. New York clubs 4 homers, including Gehrig's 37th of the year. Lou
follows that with a bunt single in his next at-bat to reach 200 hits. The
Sox, aware he had 199, were looking for the bunt.

Rudy York of Detroit hits his 35th HR, tying the 1934 AL record of Hal
Trosky for rookies, but Trosky clubs 2 homers to power the Indians to a 12-5
win. This gives him 103 for the year in, including tomorrow, just 375 at-bats;
this is a ML record for the fewest at-bats in a season for a player reaching
the century mark. Barry Bonds will have 101 RBIs in 373 at-bats in 2004.

1938
During the 3-2 loss to New York in the season finale at the Polo Grounds,
Bees (Braves) outfielder Vince DiMaggio strikes out four times extending
his major league record to a season total of 129. Last month, Dom and Joe's
older brother had surpassed Gus Williams' major league mark of 120 whiffs
established by the Browns' outfielder in 1914.

Bob Feller breaks his own AL strikeout record and sets a ML strikeout mark
by fanning 18 Tigers. At one point Feller has 6 straight strikeouts and yet
loses, 4-1, to Harry Eisenstat's 4-hitter. Harry strikes out three with his
slow curves. Tiger outfielder Chet Laabs contributes 5 strikeouts, including
the last, to Feller's total. Hank Greenberg has two long drives, one a double,
and a walk - but no homers - against Rapid Robert, who allows seven hits and
walks seven. Greenberg is 3 for 3 - all singles. Detroit completes the sweep
with a 10-8 win in game 2, finally called by ump George Moriarty after seven
innings. Feller ends the season with 208 walks to set a ML record ... the
only other hurler to top 200 will be Nolan Ryan, in 1974 (204) and 1977 (202).

Bobo Newsom wins his 20th game for the 7th-place Browns, and strikes out 13,
with his 226 K's for the year just missing the league lead. His 192 walks
also just misses the lead as well ... it'll be the highest total for any
ML pitcher this century not named Feller or Ryan.

1940
The Series opens in Cincinnati, and the Reds lose, 7-2, the 10th straight
WS loss for a NL team. The Tigers bunch 5 singles, a walk and an error in
the 2nd off Paul Derringer to score 5 runs. Bruce Campbell adds a 2-run HR,
and Bobo Newsom rations 8 hits and only one walk. Bobo's father, visiting
from South Carolina, dies in a Cincinnati hotel the next morning.

1941
Dodgers ace Whit Wyatt trims the Yankees in a 3-2 Brooklyn win in game 2.

Buffalo's Freddie Hutchinson wins the International League MVP. Hutch, who won
the PCL MVP in 1938, won 26 games on the mound. He also hit .385 in 72 games.

1942
With an combination of infielders consisting mostly of shortstop Eddie Joost,
second sacker Pete Suder and first baseman Ferris Fain, the A's established a
major-league record for turning 217 double plays. The trio were the subject
of a poem written by Dick Armstrong, the Athletics' publicity director,
titled "Joost to Suder to Fain" which still remains popular in the folklore
of the franchise.

1943
The Yankees take 2 from the Browns, 5-1 and 7-6, for their 14th sweep of
a doubleheader, an AL mark. Bud Metheny hits a HR in the opener for the
Yankees 100th roundtripper of the season.

The season finishes with attendance off some 13 percent from the year
before. The Dodgers and Tigers, both good for a million in contending
years, each drop below 700,000. Only the Phils, under new ownership, have
a significant increases, from 230,000 to 467,000. NL attendance falls from
8.9 million to 7.7 million.

1947
In game 3 of the Fall Classic, the Dodgers squeak to a 9-8 win, jumping on
Bobo Newsom and Vic Raschi in the 2nd for 6 runs. Yogi Berra becomes the
first player to hit a pinch HR in WS history, hitting one off Brooklyn's
Ralph Branca in the 7th inning.

Ex-Giant Danny Gardella, suspended for 5 years for jumping to the Mexican
League, files suit for $300,000 in damages. He charges that the reserve
clause is "monopolistic and restrains trade." It will be dismissed.

1948
The Red Sox, a game in back of the Indians, host the Yankees in a critical
match for both teams. Ted Williams gives Boston a two-run lead in the 1st
with a HR off a Tommy Byrne fast ball, and Jack Kramer posts his 18th win
in beating New York, 5-1. For Kramer, it is his 5th win of the year over
the Yanks. New York can now finish no better than 2nd place.

The Indians are sure of at least a tie by whitewashing Detroit, 8-0,
behind Gene Bearden, now 19-6. It is Bearden's 2nd straight shutout and
6th straight victory. Larry Doby has 4 hits to lead the offense.

The Senators, using 2nd stringers and rookies, beat the A's, 7-1. Pitcher
Carl Scheib plays LF for the A's and goes 0 for 3. Tomorrow he'll play RF
and go 0 for 3 again, ending the year at .298. The A's finish in 4th place
(84-70) and are the first team ever to finish above .500 while scoring
fewer runs than their opponents (729-735).

1949
The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox enter the final day of the
season tied for first place. Nearly 70,000 pack Yankee Stadium to see the
finale. Rizzuto triples and scores in the 1st inning and Vic Raschi nurses
the 1-0 lead into the 8th against Ellis Kinder before the Yankees score 4
against a tired Mel Parnell and an unlucky Tex Hughson. A Sox rally falls
short, and the Yankees win the game and the pennant, 5-3. Ted Williams is
hitless in 2 official trips (and 1 for 12 in his last 4 games) while George
Kell of the Tigers goes 2 for 3. Kell's final mark is .3429 while Williams is
.3427. Ted leads the AL in homers (43) and ties for the lead with teammate
Vern Stephens in RBIs with 159. He also reaches base 358 times (194 hits,
162 walks and 2 hit by pitches), the 2nd highest total in ML history. Only
Ruth in 1923 reached more times.

One game back on the final day, the Cards finally win, 13-5, over the Cubs,
and await the progress of the Dodgers against the Phils. Musial hits 2
homers and a single and winning pitcher Howie Pollet collects 3 hits. Hank
Sauer poles his 31st for the Bruins in the 9th.

The Phillies shell Don Newcombe and tie the game 7-7 in the 6th. The game goes
overtime before the Dodgers get 2 in the 10th for the win and the pennant.

In a promotional stunt, the Browns use a different pitcher in each of
9 innings against Chicago and almost pull it off. But the White Sox win,
4-3. Roy Sievers, soon to be named Rookie of the Year, is 5 for 5, including
his 16th HR. The 9 pitchers used is, incidentally, a ML record. All the
Brownie pitchers, except for Al Papai, allow at least a hit. In game 2, Ed
Albrecht, a 29-game winner for Pine Bluff (Class C Cotton States League),
makes his winning debut and gives up 1 hit in a 5-3 win, called after 5
innings because of darkness. It's his only ML win. The lone Sox hit off
Albrecht is a 2-run triple by SS Jim Baumer, who will make his next ML
appearance with the 1961 Reds. He is the only player to play in the 40s
and 60s, and not the 50s.

A future pitching trend is foretold by the record of Yankee ace Allie Reynolds
(17-6), who finishes only 4 of 31 starts. Dave Koslo of the Giants is the
surprise ERA leader in the NL, but his 2.50 mark contains not a single
shutout.

1950
Dom DiMaggio of the Red Sox is the AL leader in steals with 15, the lowest
figure ever recorded and a reflection of the emphasis on heavy hitting
throughout the season. The younger DiMag made his contribution there as well,
batting a career-high .328, tying for the lead with 11 triples, and leading
the AL with 131 runs. His brother Joe led with a .585 slugging percentage
despite his August slump. For the second straight year, two Red Sox tie
for the top spot in RBIs, as Vern Stephens and Walt Dropo drive in 144
apiece. Last year, Stephens tied with Williams for the lead at 159. Dropo
drives in his 144 in just 136 games, the first player to top 100 with more
ribbies than games played.

1951
The Dodgers bounce back as rookie Clem Labine evens the playoff with a
10-0 win, besting the Giants' Sheldon Jones. Homeruns are smashed by Jackie
Robinson, Gil Hodges, Andy Pafko and Rube Walker. Willie Mays grounds into
3 DPs.

1952
The Yanks tie up the WS behind the masterful 3-hit pitching of Vic Raschi,
who defeats Carl Erskine 7-1. Raschi strikes out 9.

1953
The WS moves to Ebbets Field as Carl Erskine establishes a new Series
strikeout record by fanning 14 Yanks, including Mickey Mantle and Joe
Collins 4 times each. Roy Campanella breaks a 2-2 tie with a game-winning
solo HR in the 8th for a 3-2 Brooklyn win.

1954
The Giants complete the World Series sweep of the Indians when Don Liddle
beats Bob Lemon, 7-4. The Tribe, who had not lost four consecutive games
this year, completed the regular season with a 111-43 record, establishing
an American League mark for victories.

1955
The Yanks kayo lefty Karl Spooner, a surprise pick by manager Alston, in
the first with 5 runs on 2 walks, 2 singles and Moose Skowron's HR. Ford
goes all the way for the 5-1 victory. It is Spooner's last ML appearance,
the victim of an arm injury in spring training.

1956
The Comiskey Park broadcast booth catches fire, causing damage estimated
at $100,000.

1957
Whitey Ford wins, 3-1, over Warren Spahn in game 1 of the World Series at
Yankee Stadium.

NL President Warren Giles says that the 1958 schedule has no provision in
it for a New York team.

1958
The Braves erupt for 7 runs in the first and go on to defeat the Yankees,
13-5. Lew Burdette is shaky but beats New York for the 4th consecutive
time. He also chips in with a 3-run HR.

The Orioles acquire OF Dick Williams from Kansas City for SS Chico Carrasquel.

1959
In game 2, the Dodgers get a 2-out pinch homer and score 3 in the 7th to
win, 4-3, and even up the Series. Charley Neal has 2 HRs for the Dodgers,
including one in the 5th that becomes a famous photograph by Ray Gora when
a fan named Melvin Piehl tries for the ball and accidentally knocks over
a cup of beer on Al Smith's head.

1960
Washington drops a 2-1 decision to Baltimore in the last game ever
played by the original-franchise Senators. Pedro Ramos takes the loss for
Washington. The O's clinch 2nd place.

Gaylord Perry pitches the Indians to a 4-0 win over the White Sox. It is
Perry's 18th victory, tying him for the AL high with Chuck Estrada.

Boston. The Yankees go into the WS with a 15-game win streak, the most ever.

1961
Coming out of retirement, former Yankee skipper Casey Stengel agrees to manage
the Mets, New York's National League expansion team. 'The Old Perfessor'
during his three-plus years in the Amazins' dugout will compile a poor
175-404 (.302) record, but will serve as the face of the new franchise
making the team lovable losers with a loyal fan base.

1962
Just 25,321 fans are on hand at Dodger Stadium to see Drysdale (25-9) and
Sanford (24-7) square off. After 35 straight scoreless innings, the Dodgers

score twice in the 8th, but a 9th-inning sacrifice fly by Ron Fairly sends
Maury Wills home with the winning run, 8-7. The Giants tie an NL record by
using 8 hurlers in a 9-inning game. At 4 hours 18 minutes, the game is the
longest 9-inning affair in NL history.

1963
In the WS Opener, Sandy Koufax fans the first 5 batters he faces enroute to
a WS record 15. John Roseboro's 3-run HR is the difference, as Los Angeles

The Mets end an 8-game St. Louis win streak when Al Jackson beats Bob Gibson,
1-0, but the Cards remain a half game in front of the Reds.

help of their 3rd triple play of the season, and snap their 10-game loss
streak. The Phils score 4 runs in the 8th off Jim O'Toole with the rally
starting after a routine fly ball drops between Leo Cardenas and Pete
Rose. Cardenas and O'Toole exchange angry words after the game and then
start swinging. The 4th-place Giants stay in the chase when Bob Bolin shuts
out the Cubs, 9-0.

The Orioles score 6 runs in the 2nd to beat Detroit, 10-4, in a fog-bound
game. Detroit outfielders lose 2 routine fly balls in the O's big inning.

With LA winning 14 their last 15 games, Sandy Koufax' 2-1 win against the
Braves clinches the NL pennant for the Dodgers on the next to last day of

record to 382. He leads the NL in wins (26), ERA (2.04), complete games
(27) and innings pitched (335 2/3).

Willie Mays sets a Giants record with his 52nd HR, as Ron Herbel beats the
Reds, 3-2. Johnny Mize had hit 51 for the Giants in 1947.

Another Mets marathon twin bill features an 18-inning scoreless tie in
which Philadelphia's Chris Short (18-11) fans 18 batters in the 15 innings
he pitches. In ML history there has been one other 18-inning scoreless tie
and a record 19-inning scoreless tie. New York loses the first game, 6-0,
to Jim Bunning (19-9), setting ML records with 27 scoreless innings and 31
strikeouts in an overtime twin bill. Bunning's win is his 7th shutout of
the year, the most by a Phillie pitcher since Alexander in 1918.

1966
The Yankees end the season with a 2-0 victory over Chicago, but the team will
still finish in last place, a half game behind the Red Sox. The tenth-place
Bronx Bombers, who compiled a 70-89 record, 26 1/2 games behind Baltimore,
become the first club in franchise history to finish in the American League
cellar since 1912.

On the last day of the season, Sonny Jackson establishes a major league
rookie record with his 49th steal of the season, a mark that will last
until 1977. The Astros shortstop will finish second in the Rookie of the
Year balloting behind Tommy Helms of Cincinnati.

With the Pirates ahead of the Giants by 2 runs at the end of 8 innings,
ex-Buc Ozzie Virgil ties the score with his last major league hit, a pinch
single. The Giants' bullpen holds and Willie McCovey's monster (estimated
at 500 feet) pinch homer in the 11th wins it, 7-4. The Giants use every
player except Gaylord Perry, held out in case he is needed to pitch against
the Reds. With the Dodgers winning, the Giants finish 1 1/2 behind, and a
San Francisco rainout will not need to be rescheduled. Matty Alou of the
Pirates ends the season with a .342 average to lead the NL, but drives in
just 27 runs. This is a record low for a batting leader.

Sandy Koufax clinches the 3rd Los Angeles pennant in 4 years, working with
just 2 days rest for a 6-3 win at Philadelphia. Koufax sets Los Angeles
records with 27 wins and a 1.73 ERA. Philadelphia wins the first game,
beating reliever Don Drysdale, behind Christ Short's 20th victory, 4-3. Short

Cards rookie Jim Cosman makes his first ML appearance, shutting out the Cubs,
2-0. St. Louis OF Curt Flood concludes the season with his 159th consecutive

for himself rather than use the DH, the first such incident in the AL all
season. Jenkins singles to break up Twin Jim Hughes' no-hitter, scores the
Rangers' first run, and goes on to win his 25th game of the season, 2-1. With
2 outs in the bottom of the 9th, Harmon Killebrew pinch hits for Larry Hisle
and strikes out. It is the Killer's last ML at-bat as a Twin. He'll sign on as

Niekro as the Braves shut out the Reds, 3-0.

a 6-3 loss to the Astros. It is Baker's 30th HR of the year, enabling him to
join teammates Garvey (33), Reggie Smith (32) and Ron Cey (30) in making the
Dodgers the first team ever to boast four 30-HR hitters in one season. When
he crosses the plate he is greeted by on-deck batter Glenn Burke, who raises
his hands and Baker matches him, allegedly the first high five in history.

1978
The Yankees and Red Sox, tied for first at the end of the regular season,

by striking out 9 batters to break Jim Maloney's mark of 265.

Cardinals and will become the seventh pitcher in baseball history to finish
the season leading both leagues in wins (24), ERA (1.53) and strikeouts
(268). Doc joins Walter Johnson (Senators - 1913), Grover Cleveland Alexander
(Phillies - 1915, 1917) Dazzy Vance (Dodgers - 1924), Lefty Grove (A's -
1930, 1931), Hal Newhouser (Tigers - 1945), and Sandy Koufax (Dodgers -
1963, 1965, 1966) in winning the major league pitching triple crown, but he
will not follow the six legends into the Hall of Fame. Today Gooden beats
Joaquin Adujar (21-11) to pull the Mets to a game in back of the Cardinals.

Commissioner Peter Ueberroth makes it clear that Seattle is in self-imposed
jeopardy of losing the Mariners citing there is no requirement for the team to
stay in their present location if they are not wanted for the long term. The

his 27 in just 238 innings, a ML-record average of one win per 9 innings,
the best ratio for a 20-game winner. Welch had no wins out of the bullpen
(as noted by Bill Deane), unlike Bob Grim, who won 20 games in 1954 in 199
IPs. Fred Fitzsimmons, 16-2 in 134 innings in 1940, is the only starter
with a better ratio.

1991

just qualifying him for the NL batting title at .370.

1995
In a one-game playoff, Randy Johnson pitches the Mariners to a 9-1 win over
the Angels. The Cy Young winner-to-be strikes out 12 and allows just 3 hits as
the M's make the post season for the first time in 19 years. Edgar Martinez is
2 for 3 to finish at .356 and win his 2nd batting title. He is the first AL
right handed hitter in the last 50 years to win 2 batting titles, though its
been done 4 times in the NL (Aaron, Clemente, Davis, Madlock). The 'Big Unit'
finishes the season with an 18-2 record to establish a new AL mark for winning
percentage of .900, surpassing the record of .893 by Ron Guidry in 1978.

without being shut out.

2001
Randy Johnson (21-6) strikes out 6 batters in 7 innings in the Diamondbacks'
10-1 win over Colorado. Arizona stays 2 games ahead of the Giants with
Johnson's 200th career victory. The 6 K's give Johnson a season total
of 372 - his 8th K title and his 2nd ERA title - and leaves Nolan Ryan's
modern day single season record of 383, set in 1973, safe. Sandy Koufax'
382 in 1965 is also safe. Johnson struck out 10 or more exactly 23 times
for the third straight season, again matching the record Nolan Ryan set with
the California Angels in 1973. Johnson also hits Larry Walker with a pitch,

ML win in relief.

innings for the A's.

The Brewers fire manager Jerry Royster.

Alex Cabrera hits his 55th HR of the season, off Osaka reliever Akira
Okamoto, to tie the Japanese League record set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and
matched by Tuffy Rhodes last year. Like Rhodes, Cabrera will see few good
pitches for the remaining games.

2003
Oakland's Barry Zito shuts down the Red Sox, 5-1, to give the Athletics a
2-0 lead in their Division Series. Oakland scores all its runs in the 2nd
inning, with Eric Byrnes' 2-run double a key blow.

Rockies lose to the Astros, 9-3. Houston rockets 6 homeruns, 2 each by Jeff

basemen. The Astros infielder records his 278th dinger and 302nd overall
to break Ryne Sandberg's major league record established in 1997.

For the second time in his career, Steve Finley hits a walk-off grand
slam. The center fielder's ninth-inning bases-loaded homerun in the 7-3

for the highest ERA for any pitcher with 300 or more appearances in the bigs.

duplicating a feat also performed by Ted Williams.

36th consecutive game. The hit gives him sole possession of the 9th-longest
streak in ML history.

lead Florida. Following the game, Jack McKeon announces his retirement as

team wide insurrection. When the two were dumped, Perisho accused McKeon
of calling him "Mike" when delivering the news.

The Astros defeat the Cubs, 6-4, to clinch the NL wild card spot in the
playoffs. Roy Oswalt wins his 20th game of the season for Houston.

The Red Sox down the Yankees, 10-1, to clinch the AL wild card spot in
the playoffs. The Sox lead the majors in runs scored for the 3rd straight
year ... the last team to do it three straight was the Dodgers in 1951-53,

2009
In the Rays' 13-4 rout of the visiting Yankees, B.J. Upton becomes the first
player in the 12-year history of the franchise to hit for the cycle. The
fleet center fielder's offensive output, which includes five hits and six
RBIs, helps Tampa Bay to deny CC Sabathia of his 20th win this season, a
feat which hasn't been accomplished by a Bronx pitcher since Andy Pettitte
posted a 21-8 record in 2003.

2010
The Royals exercise next year's $6 million option on David DeJesus, who had
season-ending surgery on his right thumb. The 30-year-old outfielder batted
.318 in 91 games for Kansas City before running into the Yankee Stadium
wall on a play in July that became an inside-the-park homerun for Derek Jeter.

The Red Sox honor infielder Mike Lowell during a 20-minute pre-game ceremony
at Fenway Park. The 2007 World Series MVP, a 13-year big league veteran who
recently has been slowed down due to a hip ailment, announced last month
that he would retire at the end of the season.

With seventy former players and coaches sitting on the infield clad in
white Braves jerseys in attendance in front of a sell-out crowd, Atlanta
honors Bobby Cox with a pre-game ceremony. The Braves longtime manager,
who will remain with the team as a consultant, is given a 2010 Lexus LS460
from the team and an 11-night cruise from his current players during the
moving tribute at Turner Field.

2012
In his last appearance of the season, Mets' 20-game winner R.A. Dickey whiffs
eight Miami batters to end the campaign with 230 strike outs, the most
in the National League. The 37-year-old knuckleballer did not foresee the
possibility of this occurrence when he wrote the opening lines of Wherever
I Wind Up, his autobiography released in March, sharing with his readers, "I
will never be a Hall of Famer and will never lead the league in strikeouts,"
unaware that he would accomplish the feat in the near future.

In a matchup of 100-loss teams, only the second occurrence in major league
history, the Astros (55-105) beat the Cubs (60-100) at Wrigley Field,
3-0. In 1962, the woeful 58-101 Chicago club played host to the expansion
Mets, sporting a 39-118 record enroute to setting the all-time modern era
record for futility.

2015
White Sox starter Chris Sale whiffs James McCann on a called strike for
his 270th strikeout of the season, breaking the franchise single-season
mark established in 1908 by Ed Walsh. The Chicago right-hander finishes his
seven-inning of work in the team's 2-1 victory over Detroit at U.S. Cellular
Field with seven strikeouts to extend the record to 274.

2016
Unbeknownst at the time, Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton will become
the last player to be issued a four-pitch intentional walk when he gets
a free pass in the top of the eighth inning off Nationals relief pitcher
Reynaldo Lopez in Miami's 10-7 loss in Washington. In an effort to speed
up the game, the implementation of the strategic base-on-balls will become
automatic next season, making it unnecessary to throw four balls out of
the strike zone to walk a batter.
