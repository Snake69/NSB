Oct 1

1903
The first modern World Series game, also called "Championship of the United
States," is played at Boston's Huntington Street park before an overflow
crowd of 16,242. Deacon Phillippe pitches Pittsburgh to a 7-3 win over Cy
Young. Pittsburgh RF Jimmy Sebring hits the first HR and adds three other
hits. 3B Tommy Leach has 4 hits, including 2 triples, for the Pirates and
winds up with four three-baggers, a Series record. The first of his triples
goes into the RF crowd and he is allowed 3B by the ump.

In the first City Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago
Nationals, Jack Taylor shuts out the Sox, 11-0, on 3 hits at the West Side
Grounds. The Colts win the next 2 games, but Taylor will lose his next three
starts and the series will end tied at 7 apiece on October 15. Sox owner
Charles Comiskey is willing to play it out but the Colts' Jim Hart is not
(according to historian Benton Stark). Hart is convinced that Taylor lost
his games deliberately for money and will trade the star in 2 months.

1905
In the first game of a twinbill, the Giants beat the Reds, 5-4, to clinch
the NL pennant.

1906
Hugh Jennings resigns as Baltimore manager to take over at Detroit for
1907. Infusing the Tigers with aggressive Baltimore spirit, he will win
pennants the next 3 years, and stay at the helm for 14.

The Series-bound Colts sweep two from the Phillies, winning the first game,
4-0, behind Carl Lundgren's 2-hitter. They then take the nitecap, 4-3, in
a six-inning contest called because of darkness, as Ed Reulbach wins his
12th straight. This tops Mordecai Brown's 11-game winning streak snapped
earlier this month. Reulbach will win 14 in a row in 1909, a 20th-century
Cubs record. Lundren finishes the year with a 2.21 ERA, the only one of 6
pitchers on the staff over 2.00. It is led by Brown's 1.04,

The Cardinals get whitewashed twice today, losing 3-0 and 2-0 to the
Giants. Red Ames wins the opener and George Ferguson takes the nitecap
victory.

Nick Altrock pitches the White Sox to a 1-0 13-inning win over
the Browns. Altrock has 6 assists to help him win his 20th of the
season. Tannehill's RBI single scores Patsy Dougherty with the lone run. Frank
Owen will toss another shutout tomorrow for the Sox.

1907
The Cubs score one run in the 9th against Mathewson to tie the score at 1-1,
then push across the winner against a tired Matty in the 11th to beat the
Giants, 2-1. Chick Fraser and Carl Lundgren allow just 2 Giant safeties in
11 frames.

1908
Ed Reulbach shuts out the Reds for a 6-0 Cubs win, and Reulbach's 4th
straight shutout, tying a mark set by Three Finger Brown earlier in the
year. Big Ed will complete 44 consecutive scoreless innings, an NL record
until Carl Hubbell's 46 in 1933, and the 4 straight shutouts will not be
tied until another Cub, Bill Lee, does it in 1938.

With one days' rest, Mathewson pitches the first of two games, outlasting
Frank Corridon, 4-3. Matty is peppered for 10 hits, but allows no runs after
the 5th. It is Mathewson's 37th win of the year. The Phils take the 2nd game,
6-2, but New York is still in 1st place.

1910
Rookie Lefty Russell blanks the Red Sox, 3-0, in his first start, for
Philadelphia's 100th win and his sole ML victory in his 3-year career.

In a 9-6 Chicago win in Cincinnati, the Cubs' Johnny Evers breaks his ankle
sliding home in the 5th and will not play in the WS. He'll play just 46
games next season.

1911
The Giants complete a western trip that ices the pennant by beating the
Cubs, 5-0, behind Rube Marquard. Chicago's Jimmy Sheckard sets a NL record
by drawing his 147th walk, a mark not broken until Dodger Eddie Stanky's
148 in 1945.

1913
Jack Bentley makes his major league debut for Washington, shutting out the
A's, 1-0 in 8 innings. The good-hitting Bentley will win five games next
year for the Nats, but will not win another in the majors until he resurfaces
with the Giants in 1923 after going 41-3 for Baltimore (IL) in three seasons.

1914
In the Braves' 7-6 win over the second-place Giants, umpire Bill Klem provides
most of the fireworks. He tires of the name-calling in the 6th inning and
clears the entire Giants bench. 24 players, including many rookies, march
in step to the clubhouse.

After five starts in which Cleveland lost, Vean Gregg finally wins his
20th game, beating the Tigers, 8-1. For Gregg it is his 3rd 20-win season
in his first three years, the only 20th century major league pitcher to
accomplish that.

In a 9-7 victory, Phils slugger Gavy Cravath belts his ML-record 19th homer,
off Brooklyn's Pat Ragan. All of Gavy's homers this year have come at the
Baker Bowl, a ML-record for the 20th century, topped only by Chicago's Fred
Pfeffer in 1884 (26). Lifetime he will hit 119 homers - 93 in the Baker Bowl
- the highest percentage in history of home dingers. Cravath also leads NL
outfielders with 34 assists in right field.

1916
Hal Chase, with a lock on the NL batting title, is honored before the
Reds-Pirates game in a ceremony featuring actress May Buckley. Chase
then collects two hits in the Reds' 4-0 win to finish the season at .339,
outdistancing runner-up Jake Daubert. A month ago, Prince Hal was at .307,
while Jake was leading the league at .325. With today's win the Reds tie
the Cards for 7th place.

In a 6-3 win over Detroit, the Browns steal 8 bases to total 234 steals, an AL
record until the Oakland A's swipe 341 in 1976. Detroit adds 7 steals of its
own for a combined 15 steals, tying the AL record for 2 clubs that New York
set by themselves on Sept 28, 1911. In his 153rd game, Tiger 3B Ossie Vitt
raises his season total chances to 615, a mark that will stand for 21 years.

1917
In a 2-0 Pittsburgh win over the Braves, Boston LF Joe Jelly and SS Rabbit
Maranville combine on a 9-6 double play. Rabbit makes his out at home plate.

In an exhibition game at Ft. Hamilton, the Yankees beat Brooklyn, 11-8,
with the two teams combining for 7 homers. This matches a record set by
the Browns and Tigers during the 1886 season. A large crowd of soldiers
ringing the field helps the homer total as a number of balls land in among
them for extra bases.

1919
Just before the start of the WS, the highly favored White Sox become the
betting underdogs. A year later the White Sox will become the Black Sox,
and 8 of them - pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams, outfielders
Joe Jackson and Happy Felsch, 1B Chick Gandil, SS Swede Risberg, 3B Buck
Weaver, and utility infielder Fred McMullin - will be barred from baseball
for taking part in throwing the Series. It will take that long for the story
to unfold, as most observers at the time see nothing amiss when the Series
opens in Cincinnati.

Eddie Cicotte, a 29-game winner, is driven to cover in a 5-run
4th. Cincinnati's Dutch Ruether pitches a 6-hitter, and has 3 RBIs on 2
triples and a single for a 9-1 win. Reds OF Greasy Neale, the only man
to play in a WS, coach a football team in the Rose Bowl, and become a pro
football Hall of Fame coach, also has 3 hits. He will top the Reds with a
.357 batting average for the Series.

1920
In the first of 2 games the Indians blow a 4-0 lead over the Tigers and Jim
Bagby, in a rare relief appearance replacing Duster Mails, loses in the
10th, 5-4. Sewell's 2-base error puts the winning run on base. Cleveland
rebounds in the 2nd game and has a 10-3 lead in the 8th when the game is
called because of darkness. Ray Caldwell wins his 20th game, a decision
that assures the Indians of at least a tie for the pennant.

With the White Sox' makeshift lineup, they take a 3-0 lead, but the St. Louis
Browns knock out Red Faber in the 3rd and wins, 8-6. the Tribe leads by 2
games with 2 remaining.

Grover Alexander outlasts Jesse Haines as both go 17 innings in the Cubs'
3-2 win over St. Louis. For Haines, it is his 20th loss of the year. It is
Alexander's 27th win of the year, tops in the NL.

1921
White Sox backstop Ray Schalk is the first catcher to make a putout at
every single base. The feat has not been accomplished again.

After clinching the pennant with a 5-3 win over Philadelphia in the opener
behind Carl Mays' 17th straight win over Philadelphia, the Yankees bring
Babe Ruth in to pitch in relief in the night cap. Ruth, with just one other
pitching appearance all season, takes over in the 8th with New York in the
lead, 6-0. Ruth quickly allows the A's 6 runs to tie the score, but then
knuckles down to hold them scoreless to the 11th when New York scores a
run to win, 7-6. Ruth drives in his 167th run in the game, besting Sam
Thompson's mark set in 1884. For Mays, it is his 7th straight win over
Philley this season.

At Detroit, the Browns beat the Tigers, 11-6 in 11 innings. Detroit is without
Cobb who was suspended the last two games of the season for an argument with
ump Evans a week ago in Washington (though Detroit has not played since
the 26th). Detroit's Harry Heilmann is 0 for 5 and down to .396. He'll go
1 for 4 tomorrow, but will lead the AL in hitting with a .394 average.

1922
In the Cards' 7-1 win at Chicago, Rogers Hornsby's 3 for 5 on the last day
puts him at .401, the first .400-hitter in the NL since Ed Delahanty in
1899. His NL-record 250 hits top Willie Keeler's 243 in 1897. Hornsby wins
the Triple Crown with 152 RBIs and 42 HRs. His 102 extra-base hits will be
the NL's best until Chuck Klein's 107 in 1930.

In the 2nd of two games in Boston, Giants OF Hy Higbee clouts a 6th-inning
2-run homer off Al Yeargin to pace New York to a 3-0 win. It is Higbee's
3rd game as a Giant and his HR comes in his last ML at-bat. Art Nehf is
the winner. Boston's Tim McNamara wins the opener by the identical 3-0 score.

The second place Reds sweep a pair from the visiting Pirates, winning 5-4
and 5-1. Wilbur Cooper (23-14) takes the opening loss, as he's done in by
4 unearned runs. The Reds' Pat Duncan is caught stealing for the 28th time
in 40 attempts.

1924
Another bribery scandal clouds the WS atmosphere. Judge Landis bans Giants OF
Jimmy O'Connell and coach Cozy Dolan from the WS after they admit an attempt
to bribe Phils SS Heinie Sand on the 27th to "go easy" in their season-ending
series against the Giants. O'Connell implicates Frank Frisch, George Kelly
and Ross Youngs, who deny everything and are cleared by Landis. O'Connell
is out of baseball at 23. AL President Ban Johnson, an enemy of the Giants'
John McGraw, proclaims that the World Series should be canceled because of
the betting scandal, a pronouncement that the owners will ignore. Johnson,
however, decides not to attend any WS games.

In Washington, a crowd estimated at 100,000 lines Pennsylvania Avenue to
cheer the Senators.

In Cubs Park, Sen Kaney calls Chicago's first radio broadcast from a
grandstand behind home plate. The Cubs beat the White Sox, 10-7, in a City
Series game. The Cubs' regular season broadcasts will start next year.

1927
The Pirates clinch the NL flag, beating the Reds, 9-6. They will finish 1
1/2 games ahead of the Cards and 2 in front of New York.

The Yankees win number 110, beating the Senators, 4-3.

The A's sweep a pair over visiting Boston, winning 10-3 and 3-2. Al Simmons
is 4 for 5 in the opener and 1 for 2 in the nitecap, but finishes 2nd in
the batting race. Eddie Collins plays in game 2 and goes 4 for 4.

1928
Washington owner Clark Griffith fires manager Bucky Harris. The former
"Boy Wonder", now 31, hit just .204 as player-manager.

1929
Before fewer than 500 paying fans, in the first of a 5 game series, the
host Reds drop a 3-2 decision to the Cubs and Guy Bush.

1930
The World Series opens with a Wednesday game at Philadelphia's Shibe
Park. The defending World Champion Athletics are held to 5 hits by Burleigh
Grimes. Lefty Grove limits the Cards to a pair of runs, as the A's capitalize
on their power. Their 5 hits include HRs by Mickey Cochrane and Al Simmons' 2
triples and a double, providing Philadelphia with single runs in 5 different
innings and a 5-2 victory.

1931
Pepper Martin, an unheralded rookie, gets 3 hits, but the A's Lefty Grove
coasts to an easy 6-2 victory in the WS opener in St. Louis.

1932
Eighteen-year-old Joe DiMaggio makes his professional debut at the end of
the San Francisco Seals campaign playing shortstop for the team and getting
1 hit against the Missions. Next year, the future Yankee superstar will
hit .340 with 169 RBI's and 28 homeruns in his first full season in the
Pacific Coast League.

The WS moves to Chicago, and the Yankees continue to torment the Cubs, winning
7-5. In the fifth inning, Babe Ruth waits until he has 2 strikes and then
gestures to P Charlie Root. He belts the next pitch into the CF bleachers,
Ruth's 2nd HR of the game. Gehrig also hammers out 2 round-trippers,
including his 2nd homer, in the 5th off Root following Ruth's "called shot."

1933
Nick Altrock, clowning coach of the Series-bound Senators, pinch-hits for
Johnny Kerr at the age of 57 in a 3-0 11-inning loss to the A's. Altrock
bats with 2 outs in the 11th against Rube Walberg. The Washington Post
reported it as follows:  "Amid such absurdities as Cliff Bolton playing
right field, and Nick Altrock pinch hitting as the Nats' dying gesture,
the American League season came to a close at Griffith Stadium yesterday,
with the Athletics winning, 3 to 0, in the eleventh inning of a ball game
that had no more bearing on the baseball situation than the NRA code of the
buttonhole workers. Three runs behind and two out going into the last of the
eleventh, the Nats went down fighting, leastwise, Nick Altrock did. Uncle
Nick was the Nats' last hope. Walberg showed his contempt by calling in
all his outfielders. His infielders surrounded the pitching box. Walberg
dared Nick to hit the ball, and Nick hit it. He hit it back to Walberg
and then went down fighting. Walberg fielded the ball, ran to the baseline
and waited for Nick, but he reckoned without the 'inside' baseball of the
Nats' clown. Altrock sidestepped Walberg via the dugout and reached first
safely. When he was called out for running out of bounds, he pleaded in
vain with the official scorer to overrule umpire Summers' decision."

Babe Ruth attracts 25,000 fans to the Stadium as he takes the mound against
the Red Sox. The Babe hits a 5th-inning HR and takes a 6-0 lead into the
6th inning, then hangs on for a 6-5 complete-game win while giving up 12
hits. The Yankees back the Babe with 18 outfield putouts. Today is his last
career pitching appearance, and he finishes his Yankee pitching career
at 5-0. Bosox hurler Bob Kline takes the loss. Ruth now has 10 winning
seasons in 10 years as a pitcher, a mark that will be matched in 2004 by
Andy Pettitte. Ruth's career won-loss record is 94-46.

1936
Rain postpones the 2nd WS game.

1937
At Ebbets Field, the Dodgers make the off-season look a little better by
topping the Giants, 7-4, and ending their 14-game losing streak. Only once
before has Brooklyn lost as many as 14 games in a row.

1938
The Cubs clinch the pennant, beating the Cards in the 2nd game of a twin
bill, 10-3, after the Birds win the opener.

Against the Yankees' Johnny Murphy, Jimmie Foxx unloads a grand slam in
the 6th inning, his 3rd of the year.

At Cincinnati, the Reds collect 17 hits to beat the Pirates, 9-6. Ernie
Lombardi is 4 for 5 and, with a hit tomorrow, will end the season with a
NL high .342. Through September 28 he was hitting .337, second to Mize's .339.

1939
The Tigers and Indians split, Cleveland winning the opener, 8-3, behind
Feller's 24th win. The Tigers take the nitecap, 1-0, behind Bobo Newsom's 20th
win of the year. Bobo won 3 with St. Louis before being traded to Detroit.

1941
Red Ruffing pitches the Yankees to a 3-2 win over the Dodgers at Yankee
Stadium in the opening game of the WS. Joe Gordon chips in with a HR and
RBI single.

1942
Behind 3-0, the Yankees tie it up in the top of the 8th, but rookie Stan
Musial singles in Enos Slaughter in the bottom of the inning to forge a
4-3 Cardinal victory.

1944
In Detroit 45,565 watch 27-game winner Dizzy Trout, pitching on one day's
rest, lose to Washington knuckleballer Dutch Leonard, 4-1. Prior to that,
Leonard had lost 7 straight to Detroit in 1943-44. Years later, Leonard
reports he had received a phone call offering him $20,000 to throw the
game. Despite the victory, the Senators will finish in 8th place, 25 games
behind the first-place Browns. Except for the shortened season of 1918,
this is the closest an 8th place AL team will finish to the leader.

The Browns have their first sellout in 20 years, and their largest crowd
ever, as 37,815 pack Sportsman's Park. St. Louis clinches the flag on the
final day of the season by sweeping the series with the Yankees and winning,
5-2. The big blows are a pair of 2-run HRs by Chet Laabs off Mel Queen. Sig
Jakucki is the winning pitcher.

At Chicago, the Red Sox and White Sox scramble through a double header,
finishing the two games in a total of 2 hours 48 minutes. In the opener,
Rex Cecil outduels Chicago's Joe Haynes to give Boston a 3-1 win as each
team collects 5 hits. In the nitecap, completed in 1 hour 10 minutes,
Chicago raps 11 hits off Johnny Humphries, but 4th-place Boston wins,
4-1. The crowd is 3,917, up from 839 yesterday.

A's reliever Joe Berry wins a pair from the Indians, pitching two innings in
the opener, a 5-2 win, and four more in the nitecap, 5-0 in 10 innings. Berry
finishes the year with 10 wins and 8 losses, AL highs in relief. His 12
saves is also tops in the AL. Boudreau is 1 for 8 to win the AL batting title
(.327) over the Army's Bobby Doerr.

1946
In the first-ever NL playoff before 26,012 at Sportsman's Park the Dodgers
manage just 3 hits off Howie Pollet and lose, 4-2. Joe Garagiola's 3 hits
pace the Cardinals as they beat Ralph Branca.

While waiting for the NL playoff to be completed, the Red Sox tune up
by playing a team of AL All-Stars. In the 5th, Senator P Mickey Haefner
accidentally hits Ted Williams on the right elbow with a pitch. The injury
will affect Williams' play in the WS.

Johnny Neun is named the Reds manager for next year.

1947
New York's Allie Reynolds spaces 9 hits and coasts to a 10-3 victory. Tom
Henrich's solo HR in the 5th puts the game away for the Yankees.

1948
In the Friday opener of three games with Detroit, the Indians take a 3-2 lead
into the 9th. Starter Bob Lemon picks up a swinging bunt by Eddie Mayo and
then plunks the runner in the back with the throw. He strikes out a batter,
then walks two to load the bases, and Russ Christopher relieves and walks
in Johnny Lipon with the tying run. A dropped throw at first on a 5-2-3
possible DP leaves the door open for Jimmy Outlaw's two-run single over
Joe Gordon's head. The Tigers win, 5-3, to slice the Tribe's lead to a game.

1949
The Cards lose a critical game to the Cubs, 3-1, as Bob Chipman bests Cubs
nemesis Harry Brecheen. Hal Jeffcoat homers for the Cubs.

Meanwhile, the Dodgers lose to Philadelphia, 6-4, preserving the one-game
Brooklyn margin. The Phils pole 3 homers in the last 3 frames with Roe,
working on one day's rest, getting the loss.

The Red Sox need to win just one of the final 2 games against New York to
clinch the title. Before a crowd of 69,551 at Yankee Stadium, New York
overcomes a 4-0 deficit, as Joe Page is nearly untouchable in 5 innings
in relief of Allie Reynolds. Page walks in 2 runs, but he picks up the
win. Joe DiMaggio returns to the lineup for New York after his weeks-long
bout with pneumonia and scores the first run, and Johnny Lindell's HR wins
it, 5-4. The two teams are now tied.

Alex Kellner wins his 20th beating the Senators, 7-4, to finish the season
as the A's first 20-game winner since Lefty Grove in 1933. The A's, 81-73,
finish the year with the same record as the Phillies, but the Phils are in 3rd
place and the Mackmen in 5th. The Phils, one of 6 teams to have an attendance
increase, draw 834,348, while the A's draw 816,514, a drop of 128,562.

1950
In Robin Roberts' 3rd start in 5 days, Dick Sisler's dramatic HR off Don
Newcombe in the 10th clinches the pennant, 4-1, for the Whiz Kids. It is
the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the play that sets the stage for
Sisler's heroics, CF Richie Ashburn, playing shallow, throws out Dodger runner
Cal Abrams at the plate in the bottom of the 9th. Abrams will later say, "I
think they should have held me at 3rd," while Dodgers skipper Burt Shotton,
commenting on having Duke Snider hitting away, "I should have bunted. If you
don't believe me, look in the newspapers." Brooklyn's only score comes when
Pee Wee Reese hits a drive into the screen over the wall in right field. The
ball falls on top of the wall and bounces up and down long enough for Reese
to leg out an inside-the-park HR. Roberts wins his 20th, the first 20-game
winner for the Phils since Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1917. It is the
first of six consecutive 20-win seasons Roberts will compile for Philadelphia.

Gus Zernial of the White Sox hits one homer in a 4-3 first-game win over
the visiting Browns. He adds three more in the nightcap, a 10-6 loss,
to tie an AL record for a twinbill and set a club record with 29 homers,
10 of which came against St. Louis. Zeke Bonura held the Sox homer record
with 27, set in 1934, and tied by Kuhel in 1940.

Ted Williams has 4 hits to lead the Red Sox to a 7-3 win over the Series-bound
Yankees. Williams has three RBIs to finish with 97 in 89 games. With many
regulars sitting out, rookie Ernie Nevel gives up 4 runs in three innings to
take the loss. Lou Burdette gives a run in the 4th before Lopat and Eddie
(not Whitey yet) Ford also appear. Buddy Rosar's two-run homer, off Ford,
completes Boston's scoring. Harry Taylor goes the distance for his 2nd
win. Goodman, who hasn't played since pinch hitting twice in a twinbill loss
to Washington 4 days ago, wins the AL batting title with a .354 average. The
Sox have the solace of leading the majors in scoring for the 3rd straight
year ... the next AL team to do that will be the Red Sox of 2003-05.

1951
In the NL's first best-of-three play-off since 1946, Ralph Branca of the
Dodgers loses to Jim Hearn and the Giants, 3-1. Branca serves up HRs to
Bobby Thomson and Monte Irvin. It is the first game ever to be broadcast live
coast-to-coast. CBS, who obtained rights to the game, transmits the picture
from Ebbets Field, but has to get the signal from ABC, who had previously
made arrangements with WOR-TV, the New York station which carried Brooklyn's
regular season games. With both the Dodgers and Giants tied at 96-58 at
the end of regulation, Brooklyn wins the coin toss and elects to play the
first game of the playoffs at home. The next 2 games will be played at the
Polo Grounds.

1952
In game 1 of the WS, the Dodgers defeat the Yankees, 4-2, at Ebbets Field
behind relief ace Joe Black, who started only 2 games during the season.

1953
The Yankees go 2 up as Eddie Lopat beats Preacher Roe, 4-2, despite the
Dodgers' 9-5 edge in hits. Mantle's 2-run shot in the 8th inning breaks a
2-2 tie.

Bill Veeck resigns as Browns president.

1954
Dusty Rhodes gets his 3rd pinch hit of the WS, driving in 2 runs in the
3rd. He is hitting for OF Monte Irvin, who ironically had 11 hits in the
1951 Series. The Giants' Ruben Gomez easily bests Indians P Mike Garcia, 6-2.

1955
In game 4 of the World Series at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers defeat the
Yanks, 8-5.

Receiving 71 of 103 votes cast by the writers, Indians hurler Herb Score
wins the Sporting News American League Rookie of the Year award easily
outdistancing Elston Howard of the Yankees and Hector Lopez of the A's. The
22-year-old right-hander established a rookie record for strikeouts with
245 while compiling a 16-10 record for the Tribe.

Bill Virdon is selected as the National League's Rookie of the Year. The
Cardinal outfielder, easily identified by his eye glases, receives 57 of
the 92 writers' votes to beat runner-ups Phillies hurler Jack Meyer and
teammate Ken Boyer for the freshman award.

Surprise Brooklyn starter rookie Roger Craig pitches 6 innings for the 5-3
win. Two HRs by Duke Snider and one by Sandy Amoros in the first 5 innings
prove too much for New York. Snider, who hit 4 HRs in the 1952 WS, becomes
the first player in history to do this more than once.

1958
In the WS, the Braves pick up where they left off the previous year,
defeating the Yankees behind Warren Spahn, 4-3 in 10 innings.

1959
The Go-Go Sox change character at home and hammer the LA Dodgers, 11-0,
in the first game of the WS, as Ted Kluszewski has 2 HRs and 5 RBIs. Early
Wynn and Gerry Staley combine for the shutout. Yankee manager Casey Stengel,
sitting out only his 2nd Series since 1947, covers the game as a reporter.

Commissioner Ford Frick bars a Chicago auto dealer's plan to give out a
free auto for every HR hit by a White Sox player.

1960
The Yankees win their 14th straight, beating the Red Sox, 3-1 behind 3
pitchers. Jim Coates (13-3) is the winner. Nichols is the loser for the
Bosox, while Tracy Stallard, in relief, fans Roger Maris. Maris' next at-bat
against Stallard will be a momentous one a year from now.

The Cubs score a pair of unearned runs in the 14th to defeat the Dodgers,
10-8, in a 4 hour 54 minute marathon. Future Hall of Famer Billy Williams
hits his first ML homer, off the Dodgers' Stan Williams, in the 9th. Zimmer
also homers for Chicago as the win goes to Glen Hobbie (16-20).

1961
Roger Maris' torturous, season-long race against Babe Ruth ends in a dramatic
at-bat against Boston's Tracy Stallard. Maris' classic lefthanded swing sends
homerun number 61 into the RF stands in "The House That Ruth Built." (Sal
Durante, one of 23,154 fans in attendance, grabs the historic HR ball which
he sells for $5,000.) New York's 1-0 win gives the Yanks 109 wins, one short
of the club's 1927 record. It is New York's ML-record 240th homer of the
year. On this date, exactly two years later, a baby named Mark McGwire will
be born. Maris' record will stand until McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals
breaks it in 1998.

Setting another ML record, the Cubs and Dodgers use 11 pinch hitters in one

puts Colorado 23 games over .500, another first in the 17 year history
of franchise.

Tony La Russa moves past John McGraw into second place for the most games
