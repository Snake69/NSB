Oct 9

1903
The World Series is postponed because of cold weather.

1904
Cincinnati pitchers Tom Walker and Noodles Hahn each throw a shutout against
St. Louis. Walker allows 6 hits in winning, 3-0, while Hahn allows one hit
in winning, 1-0 in 7 innings. The nitecap was called because of darkness.

1905
At Philadelphia, in the first game of a World Series under a 7-game format,
two Pennsylvanian rivals square off:  Bucknell's Christy Mathewson outpitches
26-game-winner Eddie Plank (Gettysburg Academy) to win, 3-0, in the first
game of the all-shutout World Series. Matty allows 4 hits and walks none. The
Giants hurler will blank the A's twice more during the Fall Classic.

1906
Snow flies at the West Side Grounds as the first one-city World Series
opens with the Cubs heavy favorites over the AL's "Hitless Wonders." Neither
ballpark can accommodate the crowds, so the Chicago Tribune recreates the
games on mechanical boards displayed at theaters. White Sox starter Nick
Altrock and Cubs starter Three Finger Brown give up 4 hits each, but Cubs
errors produce 2 unearned runs for a 2-1 White Sox victory.

1907
In game 2, the Tigers score just once against Chicago's Jack Pfiester and
lose, 3-1. They will not score more than once in any of the remaining games
in the WS. The Tigers take advantage of the aggressive baserunning of Jimmy
Slagle by nabbing him in the first inning with a hidden ball trick, the only
one in WS history. Yesterday, Slagle had two steals and was caught stealing
once. The play goes Germany Schaefer to Bill Coughlin (according to Bill
Deane). Slagle redeems himself in the 4th by driving in the go-ahead run
and then scoring on Sheckard's double.

1909
The Tigers win the 2nd WS game behind Bill Donovan, 7-2, knotting the
World Series at one game apiece. Cobb's steal of home highlights a 3-run
3rd. Detroit has been defenseless against stolen bases in the past 3 WS,
giving up 16 in 5 games to the Cubs in 1907, 15 in 5 games to the Cubs in
1908, and 18 in 7 games to the Pirates this year, for a total of 49 in 17
games, and the highest SB totals in all of WS history. The 'Georgia Peach'
swipes home plate 54 times during his career, a major league record.

1910
The battle for the AL batting title is decided on the final day, when
Detroit's Ty Cobb edges Cleveland's Nap Lajoie .3850687 to .3840947. Neither
man covers himself with glory. Lajoie goes 8 for 8 in a doubleheader with
the Browns, accepting six "gift" hits on bunt singles on which Browns rookie
3B Red Corriden is apparently purposely stationed at the edge of the OF
grass. The prejudiced St. Louis scorer also credits popular Nap with a "hit"
on Brownie SS Bobby Wallace's wild throw to 1B. In Lajoie's last at-bat, he is
safe at first on an error call, but is credited with a sac bunt since a man
was on. The St. Louis Post is just one of the papers to be openly critical
of the move against Cobb. "All St. Louis is up in arms over the deplorable
spectacle, conceived in stupidity and executed in jealousy." The Browns win
the opener, 5-4, and Cleveland takes the nitecap, 3-0, with both managers,
Jack O'Connor and Jim Maguire catching. O'Connor is behind the plate for just
an inning, but Maguire goes all the way. Cobb, meanwhile, rather than risk
his average, sits out the last two games, the Tigers beating the White Sox
in the finale, 2-1. Ban Johnson investigates and clears everyone concerned,
enabling Cobb to win the 3rd of 9 straight batting crowns. The embarrassed
Chalmers Auto Company awards cars to both Ty and Nap. In 1981 The Sporting
News uncovers an error - crediting a 2 for 3 game twice to Cobb - that,
if corrected, would give the championship to Lajoie. But the commissioner's
committee votes unanimously to leave history unchanged.

Despite 10 walks by King Cole, the Cubs down the Cardinals, 4-3, scoring
the winning run with 2 outs in the 9th. Cole finishes the year at 20-4,
with the ML's best winning percentage and the best by a Cub in the 20th
century (Sutcliffe will be 16-1 for Chicago in 1984, but 20-6 overall).

The Leland Giants begin a 16-game series in Havana, Cuba. The black team
will play a series against the AL champion Detroit Tigers.

At a field day at Cincinnati's Palace of the Fans, Evansville's (Central
League) Sheldon LeJeune throws a baseball 426' 6 1/4" on the fly, breaking
the record set by Brooklyn's Jack Hatfield in 1872 (400' 7 1/2"). LeJeune,
who will make it to the majors for 24 games, has 4 trials and reaches his
mark with his 4th try. He reached 401' 4 1/2" on an earlier heave, longer
than his 399-foot throw on September 10, 1907. Speedy Hans Lobert is the
fastest this day, circling the bases in 14 seconds and ties teammate Ward
Miller by beating out a bunt to 1B in 3.2 seconds. He also wins the 100-yard
dash in 10 seconds flat. The Reds beat the Pirates in the last game, 7-1.

1911
With the WS not scheduled to start until the 14th, the Athletics tune up
in a series against an AL all-star team. The A's clinched on September 26th
in an 11-5 win over Detroit.

The Braves end their season with a doubleheader sweep of the Phillies,
winning 11-5 and 13-10. Jimmy Walsh both pitches and catches in game 2,
though perhaps he should stick to catching. He gives up 7 hits in his 2
2/3 inning appearance - his only in the majors - and takes the loss.

The first game of the Ohio championship between Cleveland and the Reds is
won by host Cincinnati, 4-0. The rest of the best-of-7 series will be in
Cleveland because of construction of a grandstand in Cincinnati. Tomorrow
the St. Louis city series begins with a 0-0 tie, and in 2 days the Chicago
series. These post-season matches are popular with the fans and put money
in the players' pockets.

1912
Three errors by Giants SS Art Fletcher help put Christy Mathewson behind,
4-2, until the team rallies for 3 in the 8th when Duffy Lewis muffs a fly
ball by Fred Snodgrass. Boston ties it in the last of the 8th. The Giants
push across a run in the 10th off reliever "Sea Lion" Hall, but Tris Speaker
blasts a triple to deep center. Apparently out at home trying to stretch
it into a HR, he is safe when C Art Wilson, who has just entered the game,
drops the throw for New York's 5th error. Darkness ends the game at 6-6
after 11 innings.

In the opener of the Windy City Series, Jimmy Lavender and Ed Walsh allow
no runs as the Cubs and Sox play to a 0-0 tie. After another tie, the Cubs
will win the next 3 decisions of the best-of-7 series.

1913
In game 3 at the Polo Grounds, the A's have no trouble solving Jeff
Tesreau. Rookie P Bullet Joe Bush throws a complete-game 5-hit 8-2 win
before 36,896 at the Polo Grounds, the largest crowd of the Series. Again,
the Giants use Wiltse at 1B when Snodgrass pulls up lame. At the age of 20
years 316 days, 'Bullet Bob' is the youngest pitcher to start a game in the
Fall Classic, 40 days sooner than Fernando Valenzuez (1966) and Jim Palmer
(1981), who are tied for second on list.

1914
The Boston Braves go into the WS as underdogs, despite their strong
finish. Only one regular, LF Joe Connolly, hit .300. Their strengths are
pitchers Dick Rudolph, George "Lefty" Tyler and "Seattle Bill" James,
2B Johnny Evers, who wins Chalmers' final MVP automobile, and SS Rabbit
Maranville, their cleanup hitter. The Philadelphia A's Eddie Collins, with a
.344 BA, wins the Chalmers AL award with 63 of 64 possible points. The A's
have 7 pitchers with 10 or more wins, led by Chief Bender's 17-3. Bender's
WS magic is quickly dispelled as the Braves knock him out in the 6th. Rudolph
coasts to a 5-hit 7-1 victory. Hank Gowdy has a single, double and triple. He
will hit a WS record .545, and Evers, .438. Only Ruth will top Gowdy with
.625 in 1928. Bender makes his last WS appearance, finishing with a record
59 strikeouts.

1915
Playing game 2 in tiny Baker Bowl in Philadelphia, Boston's 19-game winner
Rube Foster allows the Phils 3 hits and drives in the winning run to break
a 1-1 tie in the 9th against Erskine Mayer. The Sox win, 2-1. President
Wilson and his fiance watch the game, the first President to attend a WS.

1916
After a Sunday off, Babe Ruth outpitches Sherry Smith to win game 2 of the WS,
2-1 in 14 innings. Both starters go the distance with Smith allowing 7 hits,
Ruth giving up 6. According to the Boston Traveler, each starter throws
148 pitches. Ruth allows one run in the first, a homer by CF Hy Myers that
skips by Harry Hooper. It is only homer off Ruth this year. Only two Robins
reach base after the 8th, one on a walk and another on an error. This is
the start of 29 2/3 scoreless World Series innings pitched by Ruth.

1919
Lefty Williams gets one man out in the first before departing. The Reds
lead, 4-0, and go on to give Hod Eller a 10-5 victory and the Reds the
world title in 8 games. Joe Jackson hits the only HR of the Series. Eddie
Collins' 3 hits give him a total of 42 in WS play, a record broken in 1930
by Frank Frisch, and bettered by Lou Gehrig in 1938. A SB by Collins is
his 14th in WS competition, a record tied by Lou Brock in 1968. Before
next season begins eight Chicago players, including Shoeless Joe Jackson,
will be accused of accepting bribes to purposely throw the games.

1920
Several hours before the start of game 4, Brooklyn's Rube Marquard,
a Cleveland native, is arrested when he tries to sell a WS ticket to an
undercover cop for $350. He will be found guilty and fined a dollar and court
costs ($3.80). For their first WS game on the lakefront, 25,734 Indians fans
watch their home team score 2 in the first and 2 in the 3rd off Leon Cadore
(15-14) and Al Mamaux. Cleveland wins game 4, 5-1.

1921
After a rainout, a Sunday crowd of 36,371 watches Carl Mays and Phil Douglas
square off for game 4. Mays works 5 hitless innings, while a run-scoring
triple by Wally Schang gives the Yanks a 1-0 lead. Mays then apparently
tires and the Giants club 7 hits in the last 2 innings for 4 runs. Babe
Ruth's first WS homer comes in the 9th, but the Giants win, 4-2. A group
of Prohibition agents cause a near-riot by trying to barge their way into
the game by saying they were on "official business." When ticket takers
refuse to let them in the police are called to forcibly remove the agents
from the line, "as angry fans look on" (Dry Manhattan). Tomorrow, federal
Prohibition Commissioner Roy Haynes will issue orders barring agents from
using their badges to gain admission to places of amusement.

1924
In the WS, Tom Zachary is touched for a run on 2 hits in the first, but
scatters only 5 more hits and issues no passes the rest of the way. The
Senators win, 2-1.

In the 2nd death to strike the Cincinnati team this year, Reds 1B Jake Daubert
dies at 40 from complications from an October 2 operation for gallstones and
appendicitis. The death is controversial ... years later, Daubert's son will
contend that the doctors missed a spleen condition that later was common
in several family members, including the son. The death certificate will
note a secondary cause of death is due to concussion caused by a beaning
(May 28). This will be enough for the widow to start a law suit against the
Reds. Daubert's teammates, barnstorming in West Virginia when they hear of
his death, cancel the rest of their games.

1926
Grover Alexander scatters 8 hits in game 6 while the Cards tee off on Bob
Shawkey (8-6), Urban Shocker and Myles Thomas for 10 runs and 13 hits in
a 10-2 romp.

At San Francisco, Mission (PCL) beats Los Angeles, 15-6, behind the hitting
and pitching of Clyde Barfoot. He goes 3 for 5, with 3 homeruns and 9
RBIs. Barfoot, who pitched for Detroit earlier in the year, was a .263
hitter in the majors.

1928
After a rainout, Waite Hoyt and Bill Sherdel are back on the mound for game
4 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis. After 6 innings, the Cards hold a 2-1
lead. With one out in the 7th, Babe Ruth hits a HR, his 2nd of the game,
after seeming to take a third strike on a quick pitch from Sherdel who
took the catcher's relay with his foot on the rubber and fired back. The
umpires discussed the quick pitch, allowed in the NL but outlawed in the AL,
and ruled it would not be counted. Two pitches later, Lou Gehrig follows
suit. When Bob Meusel singles, in comes Grover Cleveland Alexander to face
Tony Lazzeri. Lazzeri doubles and later scores the 4th run of the inning. In
the 8th, Cedric Durst, subbing for Earle Combs, hits one out of the park,
and Ruth follows with his 3rd HR of the game. Final score is 7-3 and the
Yanks sweep their 2nd straight World Series (and the third in franchise
history). The Bronx Bombers live up to their name as they slug five homers
in the game, a feat which will not be matched until 1989 when Oakland
does it against San Francisco. Ruth's WS BA of .625 is still unmatched;
with Gehrig's .545 and a record 9 RBIs, they also set individual and team
offensive records for hits, HRs, total bases and at-bats in a game.

1929
In game 2 of the World Series, a 3-run HR by Foxx and a 2-run blast by Al
Simmons are enough for a 9-3 A's win over Pat Malone (22-10). George Earnshaw
(24-8) is kayoed in a 3-run Cubs 3rd; Lefty Grove comes in and shuts down
the Cubs.

1931
With the Series back in St. Louis, Lefty Grove evens matters by containing
Pepper Martin and winning easily, 8-1.

1934
In St. Louis, Dizzy Dean makes good his boast that "me and Paul will win
all 4 games." He humbles Detroit 11-0, as the Tigers go to pieces. When
Joe Medwick slides roughly into 3B in the 6th inning, he tangles with Marv
Owen. Irate Tigers fans in the temporary LF stands then launch a barrage
of fruit at Medwick, halting the game. With the score at 9-0, Commissioner
Landis removes Medwick from the game "for his own safety." While the Cardinals
celebrate their WS victory, their top farm team, Columbus, wins the final
game of a 9-game Junior WS. The American Association representatives beat
Toronto of the International League in the 2nd game of a playoff doubleheader.

1937
Carl Hubbell staves off a Yankee sweep with a 6-hit 7-3 victory. The Giants
score 6 runs in the 2nd inning. Lou Gehrig hits a 9th-inning HR to give
him a record 34 RBIs, breaking Ruth's record of 33. The Yankees make no
errors in the series, setting a record; the next team to match them will
be Baltimore, in a 4-game series in 1966.

The White Sox crush the Cubs, 14-2, to even the City series at 2 each.

Boston Bees manager Bill McKechnie signs a 2-year contract to lead
Cincinnati. McKechnie has managed the Bees since 1929.

1938
The Yankees become the first team to win 3 successive World Championships,
defeating the Cubs by a score of 8-3, as Red Ruffing wins his 2nd game and
the Yankees sweep.

1944
Emil Verban drives in 3 runs as the Cardinals top the Browns, 3-1, and
win the Series in 6 games. Ted Wilks allows no one to reach base in 3 2/3
innings of relief, fanning 4 pinch hitters. George McQuinn hits .438 for
the Series. The winners get $4,626 each; the Browns take $2,743, the lowest
player shares since 1933.

In the Junior World Series in Baltimore, a record (for Municipal Stadium)
crowd of 52,833 watch Louisville edge Batlimore, 5-4, in game 4.

1946
Boo Ferriss records the 50th shutout in WS history. He holds the opposition to
only 6 hits, as the Boston Red Sox blank the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-0. Rudy
York's 3-run HR in the first is the big blow.

1948
Before a record WS crowd of 81,897, the Indians take a 3-1 Series lead,
as Steve Gromek outpitches Johnny Sain. The first HR of the Series, by
Larry Doby, is decisive. Merv Rickert also homers for the Braves. Doby's
homerun is the first by a black player in World Series history.

1949
The Yankees pound the Dodgers, 10-6, to win the WS in 5 games. Pinch hitter
and 3B Bobby Brown is the hitting hero, batting .500 and driving in 5
runs. Joe Page wins the Babe Ruth Award for the Series.

1950
Yankees manager Casey Stengel signs a 2-year pact estimated at between
$65,000 and $80,000 a year.

1951
In game 5 of the Fall Classic, Gil MacDougal, joining Ellmer Smith (1920)
and Tony Lazzeri (1936), becomes the third player in World Series history
to hit a grand slam. The 23-year-old Yankees infielder is the first rookie
to accomplish the feat. The Yankees win in a romp, 13-1. Ed Lopat wins his
2nd game.

In New York, Browns owner Bill Veeck Jr hires Rogers Hornsby to a three-year
contract to manage the Browns. The Rajah, who last managed in the majors
in 1937 as skipper of the Browns, was fired by Bill Veeck Sr in 1932 when
Hornsby managed the Cubs. Hornsby chooses the Browns offer over a similar
one by the Cardinals, who just let Marty Marion go as manager.

1955
Pitcher Howie Fox, out of the majors in 1955, is knifed to death in a bar
fight in San Antonio, Texas. The 34-year-old was 1-2 in 1954.

1956
The Dodgers bounce back. Clem Labine comes out of the bullpen to pitch a 1-0
victory in 10 innings. Enos Slaughter misjudges Jackie Robinson's fly ball,
and Jim Gilliam scores from 2B.

1957
With Warren Spahn stricken by the flu, Lew Burdette, pitching with 2 days
rest, achieves his 3rd complete game and 2nd shutout to beat New York,
5-0. The Braves win their first WS championship since the "Miracle Braves"
of 1914 beat Connie Mack's Athletics.

1958
In game 7, the Yankees beat the defending World champion Braves in Milwaukee's
County Stadium, 6-2, for their eighteenth title, the club's seventh in the
past decade. The Bronx Bombers become only the second team, the first being
the 1925 Pirates, to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven
Fall Classic.

Twenty members of the Cardinals embark on an Asian goodwill tour, stopping
in Manila and Tokyo.

1960
Vern Law wins again, thanks to his own RBI single and Bill Virdon's 2-run
hit. Roy Face retires the final 8 batters in order. Pittsburgh's 3-2 win
evens the WS.

1961
At Crosley Field, super-subs Johnny Blanchard and Hector Lopez spark a 5-run
first inning and a 13-5 win for New York over the Reds. Both hit HRs, and
Lopez drives in 5 runs. Bud Daley's long relief effort wraps up the Series,
as Ralph Houk becomes the 3rd rookie pilot to guide a WS winner. Blanchard,
a reserve player who will collect 10 hits in 29 at-bats in five Fall
Classics, hits two homeruns and bats .400 enroute to the Bronx Bombers'
19th World Championship.

1964
Charlie Finley says he lost $834,356 in Kansas City this year, a prelude
to renewed efforts to move the A's somewhere else.

1965
Dodgers P Claude Osteen was 5-0 versus Minnesota while with the Senators,
and remains perfect against the Twins, winning 4-0 in game 3 at Chavez Ravine.

1966
For the second consecutive day, the Orioles win a World Series game, 1-0,
in a contest decided by a homerun when Frank Robinson takes a Don Drysdale
pitch deep over the left field fence in the fourth inning. The lone run being
scored on a homer is only the fifth time in the history of the Fall Classic,
and with the complete-game 4-hit shutout thrown by Dave McNally, Baltimore
completes a four-game sweep of the Dodgers. The 33 consecutive scoreless
innings pitched by Baltimore (beginning with Moe Drabowsky pitching 6.2
innings in relief of McNally in game 1, followed by shutouts by Jim Palmer
and Wally Bunker) are a WS record. The Orioles are the last of the original
eight American League franchises to win their first World Series.

1967
Roger Maris homers for the Cardinals in the 9th, but Jim Lonborg's 3-1 win
sends the WS back to Boston.

1968
Denny McLain returns to form, scattering 9 singles, as Detroit evens the
WS with a 10-run 3rd inning and 13-1 win at St. Louis.

1969
Just a few days after agreeing to be on the coaching staff of the Angels,
Sparky Anderson accepts an offer to replace Dave Bristol as the manager of
the Reds. During his nine-year tenure, in which Cincinnati will average 96
victories a season, the club will win five divisional titles, four National
League pennants, and consecutive World Series in 1975 and 1976.

Danny Murtaugh signs on for a 3rd term as manager of the Pirates.

1970
The Tigers trade Denny McLain to the Senators in an 8-player deal that
also sees OF Elliott Maddox, 3B Aurelio Rodriguez and P Joe Coleman change
teams. This ranks as one of Detroit's best trades ever.

1971
The Orioles win game one of the WS over the Pirates, 5-3, behind Dave
McNally's 3-hitter and Merv Rettenmund's 3-run homer. Frank Robinson also
homers, off Dock Ellis, who he homered off of in the All-Star game - a first.

1972
The Pirates edge the Reds, 3-2, as Manny Sanguillen homers and drives in the
winning run in the 8th. Pittsburgh comes within one game of clinching the LCS.

1973
The Reds beat the Mets, 2-1, on a 12th-inning HR by Rose to even their
series at 2-2.

Bert Campaneris leads off the 11th with a HR to give Oakland a 2-1 win over
Mike Cuellar and the Orioles.

1974
Los Angeles advances to the WS with a 12-1 win over the Bucs. Steve Garvey
has 2 singles and 2 doubles, and scores 4 runs as Don Sutton wins his 2nd
LCS game and 11th in a row.

The A's get just one hit, but draw 11 walks, 9 off loser Mike Cuellar, in
beating the Orioles, 2-1. Cuellar walks Gene Tenace in the 6th to force in
a run, and Reggie Jackson doubles in the winning run in the 7th.

1976
While on his way home from his party, Pirates reliever Bob Moose is killed
on his birthday in an automobile accident in Martin's Ferry, Ohio. The
29-year-old's death occurs two days shy of the four-year mark of the date
he threw the infamous wild pitch giving Cincinnati a walk-off victory in
the fifth and deciding game of the NLCS.

Pete Rose has 3 hits and George Foster homers as the Reds top the Phillies,
6-3, in the first game of the NL Championship Series. Don Gullett, after
a shaky first inning, retires 21 of the last 22 batters before leaving in
the 8th. The Phils score 2 runs on Rawly Eastwick in the 9th. Steve Carlton
takes the loss.

The Yankees beat the Royals, 4-1, in the ALCS opener. George Brett's 2
first-inning errors allow 2 unearned runs, and that is all Catfish Hunter
needs as he goes the distance.

1977
For the 2nd year in succession, the Yanks score in the 9th inning of the
5th game to beat the Royals in the LCS. Mickey Rivers gets the game-winning
hit. The final score is New York 5, Kansas City 3.

1980
In game 2 of the ALCS with the Yankees trailing, 3-2, with two outs
in the top of the eighth inning, George Steinbrenner is caught on live
national television jumping out of his seat and shouting what appears to be
profanities when Willie Randolph is tagged out at home on a relay throw by
George Brett. The Yankees' owner wants third-base coach Mike Ferraro fired
on the spot, but manager Dick Howser refuses and the skipper will lose his
job when the team is swept in three games by the Royals, despite a first
place finish in the American League East compiling a 103-59 record.

1981
The Phillies bats wake up, collecting 13 hits in a 6-2 win over
Montreal. Montreal chips in with 4 errors.

Facing elimination, the Dodgers get the pitching this time and down Houston,
6-1.

The Brewers, also facing elimination, beat the Yanks in the 8th inning,
5-3, on Paul Molitor's solo homerun. Ted Simmons clubs a 2-run homer and
Randy Lerch pitches 6 solid innings for the win.

The A's sweep Kansas City by winning, 4-1. In the 3 games, last year's
pennant winners score only 2 runs.

1982
The Brewers even the series, beating California 9-5. Reserve OF Mark Brouhard
has 3 hits, 3 RBIs and scores 4 runs for the winners.

After losing another game to rain, the Braves' Phil Niekro is able to start
the 3rd game of the NLCS after only 2 days rest, but St. Louis wins, 4-3.

1984
The Tigers win the WS opener as Jack Morris pitches a complete-game 3-2
victory. Larry Herndon's 2-run HR in the 5th is the margin.

Despite being offered another one-year contract, Angels manager John McNamara
resigns. He will be named manager of the Red Sox on the 18th.

1985
The Royals come from behind to tie the Blue Jays in the 9th and go ahead
in the 10th but lose, 6-5, in the bottom of the inning.

The first game of the NLCS results in a 4-1 Dodger win over St. Louis'
John Tudor, only his 2nd loss in his last 22 decisions.

1986
The Mets' Bob Ojeda goes the distance even though giving up 10 hits, as
New York wins, 5-1.

1987
Trailing 4-0, the Cardinals rally to down the Giants, 6-5, at Candlestick.

1988
Oakland beats Boston, 4-1, to complete a 4-game sweep of the ALCS. Dennis
Eckersley saves all 4 games and is named series MVP.

Mike Scioscia's 9th-inning 2-run HR ties the game, and Kirk Gibson's
game-winner in the 12th gives the Dodgers a 5-4 win.

1989
Televising the deciding game 5 of the NLCS, a 3-2 Giants victory over the
Cubs from Candlestick Park, NBC broadcasts its final edition of the Game
of the Week. Next season, CBS' sporadic and less frequent coverage of a
regular season weekly game led many to believe the network was really
only interested in airing the All-Star Game and post-season contests.
Will Clark bats .650 in the series with 8 RBIs to win MVP honors.

1990
The Red Sox fail to hold a 1-0 lead for the 3rd consecutive game as Oakland
opens up a commanding 3-0 lead in the ALCS with a 4-1 victory.

In Pittsburgh, Paul O'Neill and Chris Sabo each homer to lead the Reds to
a 5-3 win and a 3-1 lead in the NLCS.

1991
The Blue Jays even the ALCS at 1 game apiece with a 5-2 triumph, snapping
Minnesota's post season home winning streak at 7 games.

The Pirates defeat the Braves in game 1 of the NLCS, 5-1. 1990 Cy Young Award
winner Doug Drabek gets the victory for the Bucs and Andy Van Slyke homers.

Manager Tom Trebelhorn is fired by the Brewers. After the season, the Brewers
reorganize their front office and field personnel:  Sal Bando is named Senior
Vice President - Baseball Operations, Al Goldis is named Vice President -
Scouting and Planning, Harry Dalton is Senior Vice President - Special
Projects and Bruce Manno is Assistant Vice President - Baseball Operations.

1992
Rookie Tim Wakefield hurls Pittsburgh to a 3-2 victory over the Braves,
giving the Pirates their 1st win in the NLCS. He is the 1st rookie to start
an NL playoff game since Philadelphia's Charles Hudson in 1983. Ron Gant
homers for the Braves, but Andy Van Slyke's sac fly in the 7th provides
the margin of victory.

1993
The Braves go up a game in the NLCS with a 9-4 victory. Philadelphia's John
Kruk hits the game's only HR and triple, but Tom Glavine gets the win.
