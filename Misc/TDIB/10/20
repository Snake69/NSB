rest throwing a complete-game 6-hitter, 12-5, and helps himself with 3
hits. Cubs manager Frank Chance becomes the first player ejected from a WS
game when umpire Tom Connally chases him for protesting a Danny Murphy HR
drive against a sign over the RF bleachers. Chance opines too loudly that
it should be a ground-rule double. Philadelphia takes a commanding 3-0 lead
in the World Series.

The Giants win the City Series against the Highlanders, 4-2, as Christy
Mathewson is victorious over Jack Warhop, 6-3. Larry Doyle's 3rd-inning 3-run
homer into the upper grandstand in RF is the big blow. Paid admission for the

Everett, losing 15-3. The Dodgers make 8 errors including 3 by starting
pitcher Burleigh Grimes. Bernie Neis, Johnny Mitchell, Eddie Brown and Milt
Stock spent last night in jail following the brawl in Wenatchee, and did
not make the train to today's game (as reported by Dave Larson). Charles

Dodgers. He also paid the fine of $200 each for the four players.

leaguer catcher's real name is not Mickey but Gordon. The future Yankee

the American season record of 348 set by Bob Feller in 1948. Kaneda already

in 1969.

1959
Clark Griffith of the Senators says the team will not move the franchise.

1982
The Brewers, playing in their first World Series, are unable to hold on
to a 3-1 lead in game 7, when the Cardinals, thanks to Keith Hernandez'
two-run sixth-inning single, beats Milwaukee, 6-3. It's the Redbirds'

Hatcher's 2nd HR of the Series. The win gives the Dodgers their first World
Championship since 1981. Los Angeles is the only team to win more than one
World Series in the 1980s.

1990
The talk of an Oakland dynasty is proven premature, as Cincinnati
beats Oakland, 2-1, to complete one of the most stunning sweeps in WS
history. Series MVP Jose Rijo (2-0, 0.59 ERA) retires the last 20 batters
he faces to give the Reds their first World Championship since 1976. Not
joining the celebration at the end is Eric Davis, who ruptures his kidney
diving for a ball during the game and is taken to the hospital. It will
take Davis several years to fully recover.

The Blue Jays take the WS lead with a 3-2 win over Atlanta on Candy
Maldonado's bases-loaded single in the 9th inning. Duane Ward gets credit
for the victory in relief of Juan Guzman, and Joe Carter and Kelly Gruber
homer for Toronto. In the 4th inning, Blue Jays OF Devon White's sensational
catch nearly results in a triple play. Atlanta OF Deion Sanders was ruled
safe on the play, but replays show he should have been the 3rd out. Braves
manager is ejected from the game in the 9th, becoming the 1st manager to
be thrown out of a Series game since 1985. By starting in RF, Toronto's
Joe Carter becomes the 1st player to start the 1st 3 games of a WS at 3
different positions. He started game 1 at 1B and game 2 in LF.

1993
Calling balls and strikes during game 4 at Philadelphia's Veteran Stadium,
Charlie Williams becomes the first black umpire to work home plate during
a World Series. The game becomes memorable as the Blue Jays win the 15-14
marathon which takes a record 4 hours 14 minutes to complete. Toronto's
6-run rally in the 8th inning is capped by Devon White's 2-run triple,
while Lenny Dykstra hits a pair of homers for the losers. The 29 runs in
the WS eclipses the 22 scored in a 1936 WS game.

1994
Receiving all 28 first-place votes, Raul Mondesi (.306, 16, 56) is named
the National League's Rookie of the Year. The Los Angeles rightfielder,
who easily outdistanced Astros hurler John Hudek and Braves outfielder Ryan
Klesko, is the third consecutive Dodger to win the award.

1996
The Braves continue to pound the ball, as they defeat the Yankees, 12-1,
in the WS opener at Yankee Stadium. Andruw Jones' HR in the 2nd inning
puts him in the record books as the youngest player to homer in a Series
game. He hits another 4-bagger in the 3rd inning, as John Smoltz gains the
win. Jones is the fourth rookie in baseball history to hit two homeruns
in the same World Series. The Braves center fielder joins Charlie Keller
(1939 - Yankees), Tony Kubek (1957 - Yankees) and Willie McGee (1982 -
Cardinals) in accomplishing the feat.

1998
Down 3-0, the Yankees bounce back with 2 runs in the 7th and 3 in the 8th
to defeat the Padres, 5-3. 3B Scott Brosius is the hitting star for NY with

Boston eye doctor Carmen Puliafito offers free surgery for ML umpires
during the postseason after umpires blew three calls against the Red Sox
during the ALCS. Puliafito, who chairs the ophthalmology department at the
Tufts University School of Medicine, suspects some umpires are secretly
nearsighted. "That's the only explanation I have for these 3 horrible calls."

2000
The major league play-by-play broadcasters and color commentators select
Carlos Delgado and Todd Helton as the recipients of the Hank Aaron Award. The
honor, established last year, recognizes the Blue Jay and Rockies first
basemen as the best overall hitters in each league.

The Toronto Blue Jays sign Carlos Delgado to a 4-year $68 million contract,
making him the highest-paid player in the game. The $17 million per year
surpasses Roger Clemens' salary of $15.45 million.

2001
The Diamondbacks take a 3-1 lead in their series with an 11-4 victory over
Greg Maddux and the Braves. Six of Arizona's runs are unearned as a result
of 3 Atlanta errors. Luis Gonzalez hits a 3-run homer for Arizona while
Andruw Jones connects for the Braves. Brian Anderson gets the win in relief
of starter Albie Lopez.

ALCS. Bret Boone ties an ALCS record with 5 RBIs as Jamie Moyer gets the
win. Boone, John Olerud and Jay Buhner all homer for Seattle.

2002
Twenty-year-old Venezuelan right hander Francisco Rodriguez becomes the
youngest pitcher ever to win a World Series game. With just 15 days of
major league experience, K-Rod throws 37 pitches retiring nine consecutive
batters in three innings to pick up the victory when the Angels outslug the
Giants in game 2 of the Fall Classic, 11-10. Tim Salmon goes 4 for 4 with
2 homers and 4 RBIs for Anaheim. Reggie Sanders, David Bell, Jeff Kent and
Barry Bonds connect for SF.

2004
After losing the first three games of the ALCS, the Red Sox win four
consecutive games to win the American League pennant beating the Yankees in
the Bronx, 10-3. Johnny Damon's two homeruns, including a grand slam in the
fourth, and Derek Lowe's solid pitching performance help Boston to join the
1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders as the only teams
in the history of professional sports to overcome a 3-0 series deficit to
win a seven-game series. David Ortiz and Mark Bellhorn also homer for the
Sox. Damon has 6 RBIs.

The Cardinals tie their NLCS with the Astros with a 6-4 12-inning victory. Jim
Edmonds' walkoff HR is the deciding blow. Albert Pujols also homers for
St. Louis, while Mike Lamb connects for Houston.

The Seattle Mariners name Mike Hargrove as their manager.

2005
The Marlins sign Yankees coach Joe Girardi as their new manager.

2008
The Cubs and Jim Hendry agreed to a four-year contract extension. The deal,
which will expire in 2012 and extend into the tenure of the club's new
ownership, is the general manager's reward for the team's best regular
season showing in more than sixty years enroute to its second consecutive
National League Central title.

Two storied franchises, the NFL Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees, form a
partnership which will handle concession and merchandise sales at the clubs'
new stadiums. The company, known as Legends Hospitality Management, LLC,
and founded in cooperation with Goldman Sachs and CIC Partners, envisions
expanding its services to other other professional franchises and college
programs.

2009
The Brewers hire Rick Peterson as their pitching coach to improve the club's
woeful starting pitching which posted a 5.37 ERA last season. The 54-year-old
pitching guru, known for his focus on motion analysis, is reunited with
bench coach Willie Randolph and skipper Ken Macha, who were his former
managers with the Mets and the A's, teams he toiled for in a similar role.

2010
Ted Lilly signs a three-year $33 million deal to remain with the Dodgers. The
34-year-old southpaw, obtained from the Cubs in early August, compiled a
7-4 record with a 3.52 ERA in 12 starts for LA, including victories in the
first five starts for his new team.
