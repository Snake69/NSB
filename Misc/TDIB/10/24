1908
Singing sensation Billy Murray hits the charts with "Take Me Out to the
Ball Game," the 2nd, and most popular, of 3 versions to be released within
a five-week period. The song writing team of Albert Von Tilzer (music)
and Jack Norworth (words) who created the immortal tune have never seen
a game. Ironically, Murray's 1903 hit, "Tessie," is quickly adopted by
Boston's Royal Rooters as their official theme song, much to the chagrin
of Red Sox opponents.

3rd and one in the 4th while Bender shuts down the Giants, and the A's take
a 3-1 lead in games.

bullpen. Benny Agbayani's 8th-inning double is the key hit for NY as they
cut the Yankees Series lead to 2-games-to-1. New York native John Franco

after 8 wins. The loss ends the Yankees record streak of 14 consecutive

his first Fall Classic appearance, joins Orioles outfielder Don Buford who
went yard in 1969 as a leadoff batter in game 1 off Tom Seaver of the Mets.

a 3-2 Series lead when he hits a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth
inning giving the Rangers a 4-2 victory in game 5 in Arlington. The Texas

Mantle who accomplished the feat against Pittsburgh in 1960.

money and obtaining school supplies and back-to-school clothes, supporting
juvenile diabetes and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis research, and funding
the fight against child abuse, among many other charitable efforts.
