Oct 7

1902
At Pittsburgh, Sam Leever and the Pirates beat a team of American League
all-stars, 4-3. Cy Young takes the loss.

1903
Cy Young, who will also pitch in 4 games, stops the Pirates, 11-2, on 6
hits. The 36-year-old righthander drives in 3 runs. Pittsburgh's Brickyard
Kennedy, pitching on his 35th birthday, is ahead 4-2 in the 6th when Wagner
makes 2 errors, and Boston scores 6 runs. After giving up another 4 runs
in the 7th, Kennedy is gone, and will not pitch in the majors again. Patsy
Dougherty has a single and two triples, while Chick Stahl and Jimmy Collins
add three baggers. There are 6 triples in the game.

1904
Jack Chesbro pitches the Highlanders to a 3-2 win over Boston for his
41st victory. His 41-12 record will top the AL in wins and percentage;
in 1902 with Pittsburgh, his 28-6 topped that league, making him the only
pitcher to lead both leagues in winning percentage. The win gives New York
a half-game lead over Boston.

In Cleveland's sweep of a pair, 8-1 and 9-0, from host Detroit, George
Stovall of Cleveland hits his first HR, and it comes off his older brother
Jesse, pitching for Detroit in his last game. It marks the first time one
brother gives up a HR to another, a feat which will be duplicated by the
Ferrells in 1933, and the Niekros in 1976.

Pirates 3B Tommy Leach's 3 putouts and 2 assists help the Pirates beat
the Cubs, 6-1 in 8 innings. He will finish with 643 total chances, the
highest of any 3rd sacker in the 20th Century. Only Pirates third sacker
Jimmy Williams, whom Leach replaced, had a higher total (671 in 1889).

1905
In a doubleheader split, Cincinnati's Fred Odwell lines an inside-the-park
homer, off St. Louis rookie Buster Brown, to edge out teammate Cy Seymour for
the NL homerun title. Odwell leads the NL with 9 round trippers, hit just
one last year as a rookie, and will never hit another homer. The Cardinals
win game 1, 7-3, and the Reds take the 2nd match, 6-3.

After winning the opener, 10-4, and clinching 7th place, the Boston Beaneaters
start OF Jim Delehanty on the mound in game 2. He gives up 5 hits in 2
innings but doesn't get a decision as the Beaneaters lose, 11-7. Eighth
place Brooklyn and Boston were 11-11 against each other. Beaneaters 1B Fred
Tenney has one assist in the season's final game, giving him an NL record
of 152. The mark will be topped by Sid Bream of Pittsburgh, with 166 in 1986.

1906
The White Sox end the season with a 6-1 loss to Detroit, the only team not
to lose a season series with the Sox. Each team won 11 games from the other.

Cleveland finishes the year with a 7-3 win over the Browns, good for a 3rd
place finish. Nonetheless, Cleveland leads the AL in hitting, fielding,
total bases, has three 20-game winners, five .300 hitters, and the AL's
top run scorer and base stealer.

1908
The Giants complete a 3-game sweep in Boston, winning the final, 7-2,
with two wins going to Red Ames and a victory to Joe McGinnity. The season
ends with New York and the Cubs each at 98-55, and Pittsburgh at 98-56. The
Giants sweep Boston in all three games, New York ends tied with Chicago. A
playoff game will be held tomorrow.

The last-place New York Highlanders close out the season losing, 1-0 in 11
innings, to Walter Johnson and the Senators. Johnson, who missed 10 weeks,
ends up at 14-14 with a 1.65 ERA.

1909
On the last day of the season, Brooklyn beats the Giants, 7-5.

1911
With just 1,000 fans on hand at the Polo Grounds, New York Giants mascot
Victory Faust hurls the 9th inning against Boston, allowing a hit and a
run in a 5-2 loss. Faust also hits, circling the bases for a score as the
Rustlers deliberately throw wildly. Faust will reprise his act on October
12th against Brooklyn:  he allows a hit in his one inning; is hit by a
pitch and then steals 2B and 3B, and scores on a grounder.

On a raw day in St. Louis, the Tigers edge the Browns, 1-0, before 66
fans. Ralph Works is the winner.

The White Sox move into 4th place with a 10-4 win over the Senators. Rollie
Zeider scores 5 runs and hits a homerun.

In Boston a distraught Eleanor Keane says that her fiance Duffy Lewis had
phoned to break off their planned wedding for next week on the advice of
Boston president John Taylor. Ms. Keane says she still trusts him even though
Lewis had broken engagements to two other women before they met two years ago.

1913
Rube Marquard gets the call for the Giants against Philadelphia's Chief
Bender in game 1 of the WS. Bender yields 11 hits, but Frank Baker's HR
and 3 RBIs pace a 6-4 win over the New Yorkers. Baker knocks in a run in
the 3rd inning with a "Cincinnati base hit," when he tops a ball to 1B Fred
Merkle. When Merkle goes to tag Baker, Frank stops running and a confused
Merkle then throws home in an unsuccessful attempt to nab Oldring running
from 3B. Following the season, the Baseball Writers Association votes 35-26
to abolish the one year category of "Cincinnati base hits."

1914
The Senators and the Red Sox wind up the season with a meaningless game
in Boston. Washington manager Clark Griffith, 45, makes his final mound
appearance, while Boston's star outfielder Tris Speaker does the only
pitching of his career, giving up a run in an inning. Ruth, in relief of
starter Hugh Bedient, pitches 3 innings for Boston.

1915
At Boston, the Giants win, 15-8, in the quickest game of the season ...
62 minutes. New York collects 24 hits, with Doyle, Burns and Kocher
each hitting 4. Larry Doyle pads his league-high average to finish at
.320. Brothers Joe and Red Shannon play for Boston; Joe in his last game
and Red in his debut. The Giants finish in last place, but are just 21
games behind the league leader, the closest an 8th place team will finish
in major league history.

In the city series in Chicago, the Cubs even the games at one apiece behind
Jimmy Lavender's 4-0 effort.

1916
Despite a 4-run Brooklyn rally in the 9th, the Red Sox defeat Rube Marquard,
6-5, to win game 1 of the WS at Braves Field. Ernie Shore gets the win,
Carl Mays a save. The Sox turn 4 double plays, including a spectacular 9-2
where Harry Hooper makes the catch from a sitting position and quickly gets
up to throw out Zack Wheat at the plate.

1917
In game 2 New York's Ferdie Schupp doesn't get out of the 2nd inning,
and reliever Fred Anderson is bombed in a 5-run 4th, as the 14 White Sox
hits produce a 7-2 win for Red Faber. Faber's pitching is better than his
baserunning; in the 5th inning, he tries to steal 3B, only to find teammate
Buck Weaver occupying it. 3B Zimmerman tags both runners out, though Weaver
is still safe.

1918
Former Detroit P Bun Troy, born in Germany, is killed in Meuse, France.

1919
In game 6, Happy Felsch's error and 2 boots by Swede Risberg help put Dickie
Kerr in the hole, 4-0, but Felsch, Weaver and Jackson combine for 7 hits
as the Sox win, 5-4. Dutch Ruether doesn't survive the 6th; Jimmy Ring is
the loser, as Kerr wins his 2nd.

1920
Two Brooklyn runs in the first lead to a quick exit for Cleveland starter
Ray Caldwell (20-10). John "Duster" Mails and George Uhle shut down the
Robins, but southpaw Sherry Smith (11-9) gives up 3 hits; the visitors'
only run results from an error by Zack Wheat on Tris Speaker's double. It's
a 2-1 win, and a 2-1 Series lead for Brooklyn.

1921
The Giants' bats wake up against Bob Shawkey (18-12) and 3 other pitchers. A
20-hit barrage and 8-run 8th sink the Yanks, 13-5. Jesse Barnes (15-9)
gets the win. Ross Youngs sets a WS record with a pair of long hits -
2B and 3B - and 5 total bases in the 8th.

Commissioner Landis orders the Pirates to pay a full share from the WS
pool to Tony Brottem and to Chief Yellowhorse. Yellowhorse started well
but was injured much of the latter season, while Brottem joined the team
in July. The Bucs had voted Brottem $200 and Yellowhorse a 2/3rd share.

1922
Judge Landis insists game 4 be played despite a heavy rain. Again one big
inning - a 4-run fourth off Carl Mays (13-4) - is enough for McQuillan
to squeeze out a 4-3 win. Aaron Ward's 2nd HR of the Series is all the
long-ball clout the Yankees will display. Mays' brief collapse today,
coupled with his two losses in the 1921 series, leads to rumors that he
took money to throw the games. The accusations will persist for decades.

1923
At New York, Yankees SS Everett Scott runs his consecutive-game streak to
1,138 in a 9-7 season finale loss to the A's.

1924
The preceding day's record attendance is topped when 49,243 show up in New
York to see what turns into Goose Goslin day. The Senators' top batter has
3 singles and a HR for 4 RBIs in a 7-4 victory.

1925
Christy Mathewson dies of tuberculosis at Saranac Lake, NY, at the age
of 45. At the time of his death he was part owner and president of the
Boston Braves.

Walter Johnson (20-7) opens the World Series in Pittsburgh. A 5th-inning HR by
Pie Traynor is the only damaging blow, as Johnson fans 10 of the heavy-hitting
Bucs for a 4-1 win over Lee Meadows (19-10). Sam Rice, Joe Harris and Ossie
Bluege, with 2 hits each, drive in the Washington Senators' runs. The Pirates'
charity ball sign, which during the year totaled how many fans had returned
foul balls for $1, remained at 829 as no fouls were turned in today.

In a cold opener of the annual City Series between the Cubs and the White
Sox, the Cubs' Grover Alexander and the Southsiders' Ted Blankenship each
labor 19 innings before darkness stops the game with the score 2-2. The
Cubs then win 4 of the next 5 to win the series.

The Philadelphia Bobbies, a women's professional team, sets sail for Japan
where they will play a number of exhibition games against men's teams. Using
a male battery, the Bobbies will win 60% of their games, according to an
article in the Philadelphia Bulletin of July 8, 2000.

1926
With the Series tied at 2-2, 39,552 pack Sportsman's Park to watch Herb
Pennock and Bill Sherdel duel again. The Cards score first on a double by
Jim Bottomley and a single by Les Bell. Ragged play costs the Cards a run
in the 6th. Tied 2-2 in the 10th, Mark Koenig singles, takes 2B on a wild
pitch, and after a sacrifice, comes home on Tony Lazzeri's long fly for a
3-2 Yankees win.

1927
The 60,695 on hand for game 3 see the Yankees' Herb Pennock (19-8) take
an 8-0 lead and a perfect game into the 8th. He retires Glenn Wright,
the 22nd straight batter, but Pie Traynor breaks the spell with a single,
and Clyde Barnhart doubles him home. Pennock settles for a 3-hit 8-1 victory.

1928
Veteran Tom Zachary (3-3 with New York) gets a start against the Cards'
Jesse Haines (20-8). Two infield hits followed by a triple give the Cards
2 runs. Lou Gehrig leads off the 2nd with a booming HR, and in the 4th
the sharp-fielding Taylor Douthit misplays a single before a 2-run HR by
Gehrig. Three runs in the 8th give New York a 6-3 lead that stands up when
Zachary goes all the way for a 7-3 win. Ruth and Gehrig have 2 hits each,
and Gehrig another 3 RBIs.

1931
Connie Mack, who surprised everyone in 1929 by starting veteran Howard Ehmke
in the WS opener, tries the ploy with Waite Hoyt. Pitching in his 7th WS,
Hoyt falls victim to Pepper Martin, who homers and drives in 4 runs with
3 hits. Hallahan wins for the Cards, 5-1.

1933
At the World Series, flags are at half staff to honor William L. Veeck,
Chicago Cubs president who died suddenly.

In Washington, the WS comes to a close when Mel Ott homers in the 10th
inning for a 4-3 Giants' victory. Dolf Luque gets the win in relief. The
Giants are World Champs for the 4th time.

1934
Tommy Bridges beats Dizzy Dean, 3-1, to put the Tigers within a game of
the World Championship. The Series heads back to Detroit.

1935
The Tigers end the World Series in 6 games behind Tommy Bridges' second
complete game, 4-3. Goose Goslin's single, with 2 out in the bottom of the
9th, wins the game. This was Detroit's first Series victory after failing
to win four previous times.

1937
The Yankees win the 2nd game, again by an 8-1 score, with Red Ruffing
beating Cliff Melton. Ruffing fans 8 and drives in 3 runs with 2 hits.

1939
The Series resumes at Crosley Field, and Yankee power proves too much for the
Reds, who collect ten singles. Bump Hadley pitches well enough in relief of
Lefty Gomez to wrap up a 7-3 victory. Yankee rookie OF Charlie Keller hits
2 HRs, and DiMaggio and Dickey also connect. Junior Thompson is the loser.

In Chicago's City Series, Hank Lieber belts a two-on 2-out 9th-inning homer
to lead the Cubs to a 5-3 win, and give the Cubs a 3-1 series edge. The
Sox win the next 3 to take the Windy City bragging rights.

1940
Back in Cincinnati, Bucky Walters evens the Series for the Reds with a 4-0
shutout, scattering 5 hits. Walters also becomes the first pitcher in 14
years to hit a HR in the Series.

1943
The attendance is nearly 70,000 as the Yankees take the Series lead on a
6-2 win helped by four Cardinal errors. Billy Johnston's three-run triple
in the 8th is the big blow off Al Brazle.

1944
The Cards even the Series with a 5-1 win by Harry Brecheen, who strands
10 runners.

1945
Hal Newhouser beats Hank Borowy, 8-4. A 4-run 6th, including Hank Greenberg's
double, provides the margin. The Tigers now lead the WS 3 games to 2.

1946
Harry Brecheen gives up only 4 singles in shutting out the Red Sox, 3-0. He
also drives in the first run of the game.

1947
Larry MacPhail resigns as Yankees general manager moments after the final
game of the series. Co-owners Dan Topping and Del Webb then buy out MacPhail's
one-third interest in the club for $2 million. George Weiss will become GM.

1948
Cleveland ties the Series on Bob Lemon's 4-1 win over Warren Spahn. Two
runs score in the 4th on hits by Lou Boudreau, Joe Gordon and Larry Doby.

1949
The 9th inning decides the 3rd game also. At Ebbets Field, with the game
tied 1-1, the Yanks score 3, the Dodgers 2 in the final stanza. Johnny
Mize's 2-run pinch single is the big factor followed by Jerry Coleman's
run-scoring hit. Roy Campanella and Luis Olmo hit bases-empty HRs in the
bottom of the 9th.

Danny Gardella drops his suit against baseball, settling out of court for
a reported $80,000. All other suits by players who had jumped to Mexico
have been dropped. Gardella will state in 1961 that the amount paid to him
was $60,000.

1950
Whitey Ford wins his first WS game, 5-2 over Bob Miller at the Stadium. The
4-game sweep gives the Yankees their 13th World Championship. Jerry Coleman
wins the Babe Ruth Award as the series MVP.

1952
In game 7 the Yankees take their 4th consecutive WS championship, as Allie
Reynolds, one of 3 relievers, defeats Joe Black, 4-2. Billy Martin saves
the day by snaring a 2-out bases-loaded IF pop off the bat of Jackie
Robinson. Gil Hodges goes hitless again and is 0 for 21 in the Series,
which had prompted some Brooklyn fans to gather at local churches asking
for divine help for their beloved first baseman. Each Yank will receive a
winners' share of $6,026, and each Dodger, a losers' share of $4,200.

1953
Bill Veeck tells stockholders that he faces bankruptcy unless they drop

for the win.

of Metropolitan Stadium.

7-hit 5-2 win. Lou Brock has 2 more hits, and Mike Shannon homers off loser
Gary Bell.

1968
Mickey Lolich saves Detroit, 5-3, with an unlikely assist from Lou Brock. On
2B in the 5th, Brock tries to score standing up on Julian Javier's single
and is gunned down by Willie Horton's throw. Al Kaline's bases-loaded single
off Joe Hoerner in the 7th scores 2 for the winning margin. Jose Feliciano's
modern rendition of the National Anthem before the game stirs controversy.

1969
The Cardinals trade Curt Flood along with Byron Browne, Joe Hoerner and Tim
McCarver to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Dick Allen, Jerry
Johnson and Cookie Rojas. When Flood refuses to report to Philadelphia,

firing Wren was his decision to refuse to allow Cal Ripken being late to the

personnel matters, both with front office staff and players."

2001
The Giants beat the Dodgers, 2-1, as Barry Bonds extends his major league
record for homeruns in a season to 73 when he drives a 3-2 first-inning
knuckleball off Dodger Dennis Spriner over the right field fence. The blast
also secures two more major league records for the Giants' left fielder as
he surpasses Babe Ruth (1920 - .847) with a .863 season slugging percentage
and bests Mark McGwire (1998 - one HR every 7.27 AB) by homering in every
6.52 at-bats. Bonds will have 411 total bases, 3rd in the NL behind Gonzalez
and Sosa. He also is the only player besides Kevin Maas to have more than 20
homers and not double his homerun total in RBIs. (Maas had 21 HRs, 41 RBIs,
in 1991.)

Gwynn, who is also a member of the 3000-hit club, meets the Padre outfielder
at home plate in front of a sell out crowd at Qualcomm Park. Rickey then
leaves the game. The game is the final one of Gwynn's career. Gwynn pinch
hits in the 9th and grounds out, then walks around the field shaking hands
with hometown fans. Larry Walker, who sits, wins his third NL batting title
in three years at .350. Walker and Rockies teammate Todd Helton (.336)
become the first teammates to finish 1-2 since John Olerud (.363), Paul
Molitor (.332) and Roberto Alomar (.326) were the top 3 for Toronto in 1993.

when he makes his 194th

The Cubs lose to the Pirates in their final game of the season, 4-3,
but they become the first team in ML history to not allow an opposing
pitcher to throw a complete game against them all season. Sosa closes out
2001 with his 64th homer in his final at-bat of the game and sets a new
franchise record with 98 extra base hits, one more than Hack Wilson smacked
in 1930. He also finishes with another franchise record of 425 total bases,
the 7th best all-time total, 2 ahead of Wilson, and the most in the majors
since Stan Musial's 429 in 1948. His 160 RBIs is the highest total in the
NL since Chuck Klein knocked in 170 in 1930; Sammy's RBI total for the
past 4 years also breaks Klein's 4-year mark set in 1929-32. To finish
out the record day, 5 Cubs pitchers combine for 12 strikeouts as the staff
sets a Major League record with 1,246 strikeouts. The Yankees do the same,
setting an AL mark with 1,266 strikeouts.

innings. Rafael Furcal's walkoff homer is the deciding blow. Raul Chavez
and Jeff Bagwell clout round-trippers for the Astros.

The Cubs fine OF Sammy Sosa $87,400 (one day's pay) for arriving late

trading block.

2005
In game 3 of the ALDS played at Fenway Park, the White Sox complete the

1987. After beating New York, 8-3, to take the ALDS 3 games to 1, Detroit
players start spraying champagne on fans at Comerica Park who have suffered
through 12 consecutive losing seasons and a tough month of September before
the team wins their first post-season series in 19 years. Jeremy Bonderman
goes 8+ innings for the win. He's aided by HRs by Magglio Ordonez and
Craig Monroe.

The Mets defeat Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium, 9-5, to complete a three-game
sweep in the NLDS. Jeff Kent gets 4 hits for LA, including a HR, but it's not

record collecting seven RBI's in the same inning.

2010
With only 17 instances of a manager being tossed in the history of the
postseason, two occurrences happen on the same day when the Rays' Joe Maddon
and the Twins' Ron Gardenhire are both ejected from different ALCS games. The
Tampa Bay skipper gets the heave-ho in the fifth frame in a game against
Texas for arguing a check swing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf, and the
Minnesota pilot suffers the same fate with Hunter Wendelstedt for arguing
balls and strikes in the seventh inning in the contest against the Yankees.
