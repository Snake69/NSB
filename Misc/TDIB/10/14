after assaulting his nurse with a poker. Doheny had compiled a 16-8 mark.

1905
Mathewson pitches his 3rd shutout in 6 days, giving up 6 hits to Bender's
5. The Giants win, 2-0. It will be the only Fall Classic in which every
games ends in a shutout. The A's .161 team BA is the lowest ever for a WS;
the two teams combined .185 is also the lowest. Each winning share is worth
$1,142. The A's receive $382 each, but the club owners donate their share
of the gate, raising the players' checks to $832.22.

In the Boston city series at the Huntington Grounds, the Boston Americans
beat their National League rivals, 8-2. The only win in the 7-game series,
all at Huntington, for the NL Beaneaters came on the 9th when they won,
5-2, behind Vic Willis.

1906
The White Sox, known as baseball's 'hitless wonders' complete their
unbelievable World Series upset of their powerful crosstown rivals beating
the Cubs, 8-3, at South Side Park. The Cubs had won a record 116 regular
season games. The Sox jump on Three Finger Brown for 7 runs in the first
2 innings, and coast behind Doc White. The losers' share is $439.50, the
lowest ever. The Sox players take home $1874 each.

1908
In front of the smallest crowd in World Series history, Chicago, behind the
strong pitching of Orval Overall (3 hits, 10 Ks), beats the Tigers, 2-0,
in just 85 minutes to capture the Fall Classic. The 6,210 fans (smallest
crowd in WS history), witnessing the fifth and final World Series game at
Detroit's Bennett Park, have no idea it will be the last time the Cubs will
win the World Championship in the next 100+ years.

Upset over seating arrangements at the WS, sports reporters form a
professional group that will become the Baseball Writers Association
of America.

1909
George Mullin outlasts 3 Pirate pitchers for a 5-4 win that sends the Series
to a 7th game in Detroit. This is the first WS to go the limit.

In a series between the two leagues' third-place finishers, the Red Sox
defeat the Giants and win the series, 4 games to 1.

1911
The Athletics go into the WS minus their star rookie 1B Stuffy McInnis. The
veteran Harry Davis replaces him and drives in the first run as Chief
Bender tries again to outpitch Christy Mathewson. The Giants are dressed in
the same black uniforms they wore in their 1905 conquest of the Mackmen,
and this Series starts as their last meeting ended ... Mathewson wins,
2-1. The largest crowd ever to watch a ball game - 38,281 - is at the Polo
Grounds. Gate receipts are $77,379.

1912
The Giants come out swinging against Buck O'Brien ... 4 singles, 2 doubles,
3 stolen bases, and a balk produce 5 runs. New York's Marquard gives up 2
in the 2nd, and that's all the scoring for the day. It's Buck's 2nd WS loss.

1923
In game 5, the Yankees score 3 in the first and 4 in the 2nd off Jack Bentley
(13-8), and Joe Bush spins a 3-hitter for an 8-1 win. Joe Dugan has 4 hits,

Walter Johnson retires as a player. In two weeks, he will sign a 2-year
contract to manage Newark (IL).

1929
After a Sunday off, a special train from Washington brings President and
Mrs. Hoover to Shibe Park to see if Howard Ehmke can wind up the Series
against Pat Malone. They match zeroes for 3, but with 2 outs in the 4th,
a walk and 3 hits give the Cubs a 2-0 lead. Malone stifles the A's with 2
hits and the 2-0 lead holds up into the 9th. The Athletics rally and come
up with 3 runs, the winning run scoring on a Bing Miller double, and take
the series four games to one. There won't be another winning rally by a
team down 2 runs in the 9th of game 7 this century; the Diamondbacks, in
2001, will do it next. NL MVP Rogers Hornsby, hobbled with a heel spur,
manages just five hits in the Series.

Coming off a .344 season, Detroit's Harry Heilmann clears waivers and is
sold to Cincinnati. The future Hall of Famer has been bothered by arthritis
in his wrists, but will hit .333 in 1930 before retiring as a regular player.

1930
Brooklyn sends a bundle of cash to the last-place Phillies, together with
Jumbo Elliott, Clise Dudley and Hal Lee to obtain Lefty O'Doul and Fresco
Thompson. Elliott, 10-7 with Brooklyn in 1930 (his only winning season in
5 for the Brooks), will win a league-high 19 games in 1931.

1932
Judge Landis rejects Rogers Hornsby's appeal for a share of the Cubs'
WS money.

1934
Underpaid by the Cardinals, the Deans reap profits on a barnstorming
tour. Each makes $5,000 in a game against Chicago semipros.

1939
In Baltimore, the Negro League all-stars complete a four-game series of games
against a big-league all-star team (as noted by historian John Holway) by
losing, 3-1. The winning pitcher is Pete Appleton, while the losing pitcher
is Marion "Sugar" Cain. Webster McDonald pitched hitless and runless ball
for 8 relief innings for the Negro Leaguers. The double header on October
8 was won by the Major Leaguers, 3-1 and 2-0.

1952
Welcome to the Bigs. The Giants acquire Gail Henley from Tulsa and trade
him to the Reds for P Frank Hiller. Tomorrow, Cincy will bundle Henley with
Cal Abrams and C Joe Rossi and trade the trio to Pittsburgh for 22-year-old
OF Gus Bell. Pittsburgh will then pack Henley back to the minors. Bell,
considered one of general manager Gabe Paul's best acquisitions for the
team, will become a fan favorite and will hit .288 during his nine-year
tenure in the Queen City.

1953
The Dodgers force Charley Dressen's resignation as manager when he refuses
to sign anything less than a two-year contract. The club reportedly offered
him a $7,500 raise, but on the insistence of his wife he tried for a 2-year
contract and lost. Dressen immediately signs to manage the Oakland Oaks in
the PCL.

1954
The Phils name Mayo Smith to succeed interim manager Terry Moore as their
manager for 1955.

1961
The Mets purchase 31-year-old P Johnny Antonelli, 1-0 with the Braves this
season. Anty elects to retire rather than report. New York also purchases
another lefty, Ken Mackenzie (6-4 with Louisville) from the Braves. In 2
days, the Mets sell Jim Marshall to the Cubs.

1964

The Braves say they have a firm lease offer from Atlanta.

1965
Working on two days rest, Sandy Koufax pitches a 3-hitter and blanks
Minnesota, 2-0, giving the Dodgers a 2nd World Championship in 3
years. Koufax, who threw complete game shutouts in games 5 and 7, is named
Series MVP.

1968
In the NL expansion draft, the Expos choose 30 players, including Maury Wills,
Jim Grant, Donn Clendenon and Manny Mota. San Diego's 30 selections include
Dave Giusti, Nate Colbert, Zoilo Versalles, Al McBean and Clarence Gaston.

1969
Thanks to two great catches by Tommie Agee at Shea Stadium, the Mets beat the
Orioles to take a 2-1 game lead in the World Series. The center fielder's
outfield heroics saves the team at least five runs in the 5-0 victory over
Baltimore. Agee and Ed Kranepool hit homers.

1970
After Casey Stengel throws out the first pitch, Lee May's 8th-inning 3-run
homer gives the Reds their first Series win, 6-5. RF Pete Rose throws out
Brooks Robinson at the plate and homers in the 5th. The loss ends the Orioles'
17-game winning streak which started at the end of the regular season.

1971

as the Pirates win the 5th game, 4-0, and take a 3-2 Series advantage. Roberto
Clemente hits safely in his 12th straight WS game. This is the last weekday
day game in the World Series.

1972
In game 1 of the World Series, Gene Tenace, who went 1 for 17 in the ALCS,
becomes the first player in the history to hit two homeruns in his first two
at-bats in the Fall Classic. His 2nd and 5th inning homers account for all of
the A's runs in the team's 3-2 victory over the Reds at Riverfront Stadium,
and earns the Oakland catcher a $5,000 bonus from the usually tight-fisted
owner of the club, Charlie O. Finley.

1973
The Mets win game 2, 10-7, scoring 4 runs in an 11th inning featuring the
last ML hit by Willie Mays and 2 errors by Oakland 2B Mike Andrews. Andrews
is subsequently put on the "disabled list" by Finley.

1975
In a game featuring 6 HRs, 3 by each team, the Reds prevail, 6-5 in the 10th
inning. The game is marred by a controversial play involving Cincinnati's
Ed Armbrister and Boston's Carlton Fisk. Armbrister lays down a sacrifice
bunt in the 10th and seemingly hesitates breaking out of the batter's box;
Fisk's subsequent throwing error leads to the Reds winning run. The Sox
scream for an interference call from ump Barney Barnett, but to no avail.

1976
In the final LCS game, the Yankees take the early lead only to see the Royals
even it up on Brett's 3-run homer in the 8th. Chambliss then connects on
a dramatic 9th-inning HR off relief ace Mark Littell to win the game, 7-6,
and the 30th pennant for the Yankees. By the time Chambliss reaches 2B, he
is surrounded by screaming fans who escort him around the bases. After he
reaches the dugout he returns with a police escort to make sure he touches
3B and home.

1977
Mike Torrez is the winning pitcher as New York prevails in game 3, 5-3. Mickey
Rivers slugs 3 hits, including 2 doubles.

1979
Bill Madlock has 4 hits and Tim Foli drives in 3 runs as the Pirates stay
alive with a 7-1 victory.

1980
Philadelphia pitcher Bob Walk becomes the first rookie to start a World
Series opener since Joe Black in 1952, and the Phillies rally from a 4-0
deficit to beat the Royals, 7-6. Kansas City's Willie Aikens hits a pair
of homers, becoming only the 3rd player to do so in his first WS game. Bake
McBride homers for the Phils.

1981
In game 2 of the ALCS, Yankee Graig Nettles singles twice in a 7-run 4th
inning to become the first player ever to collect 2 hits in one inning in
LCS play. New York sets LCS records for runs and hits (19) in a 13-3 rout
of Oakland.

Montreal downs LA, 3-0, behind Ray Burris' 5-hitter. Tim Raines has 3 hits.

1983
At Veterans Stadium, Jim Palmer pitches two innings of scoreless relief
and gets the win as the Orioles beat the Phillies in game 3 of the World
Series, 3-2. The Hall of Famer becomes the only pitcher in baseball history
to win a Fall Classic game in three different decades. Rick Dempsey has 2
doubles today.

1984
With the Tigers leading, 5-4, in the eighth inning of game 5 of the World
Series, Kirk Gibson hits his second homerun of the game, a three-run blast
to the upper deck in right field, putting the game out of reach to give
the Motor City its fourth World Championship in franchise history. Padres
manager Dick Williams had ordered his pitcher to intentionally walk the
Detroit right fielder, but Goose Gossage, after ignoring the walk sign at
first, convinces his skipper he can get the slugger out, only to be proven
wrong two pitches later. Detroit wins, 8-4, for its first World Championship
since 1968. This will be the last time the World Series is played outdoors
in sunlight. A single day Fall Classic game is scheduled in 1987, but the
contest is played indoors at the Metrodome in Minnesota.

1985
Ozzie Smith homers off Tom Niedenfuer with one out in the bottom of the
9th to give the Cardinals a 3-2 lead in the fifth game of the NLCS. It is
the switch-hitting Smith's first ML homerun while batting lefthanded.

1986
Riding the momentum from their dramatic come-from-behind 7-6 extra-inning
win to stave off elimination in California, the Red Sox cruise to a 10-4
win over the Angels. Boston scores 5 in the 3rd. The Fenway Park victory
evens the ALCS at 3-3.

Breaking out of a 1 for 21 slump, Mets C Gary Carter drives in the winning
run of the Mets' 2-1 win in the bottom of the 12th, rendering meaningless
Nolan Ryan's 9 innings of 2-hit 12-strikeout pitching.

1987
Danny Cox pitches the Cardinals' 2nd consecutive shutout, 6-0, over the Giants
in game 7 of the NLCS, to send St. Louis to the World Series for the 3rd time
in the 1980s. Giants OF Jeffrey Leonard (.417, 4 HRs) is named series MVP.

1989
Dave Stewart shuts out the Giants, 5-0, on 5 hits in game 1 of the World
Series. He is the first pitcher to start consecutive WS openers since the
Reds' Don Gullett in 1975 and '76.

1991
OF David Justice of the Braves fails to touch 3B while running home,
costing Atlanta a run in an eventual 1-0 loss to Pittsburgh in game 5 of
the NLCS. Jose Lind's single in the 5th accounts for the game's only run.

1992
The Blue Jays win the ALCS in 6 games with a 9-2 victory over Oakland,
becoming the 1st Canadian team to advance to the WS. Joe Carter and Candy
Maldonado bash HRs for Toronto while Juan Guzman gets the win.

The Braves come from behind to defeat the Pirates, 3-2, to win the NLCS
in 7 games. Down 2-0 to Doug Drabek entering the 9th, The decisive blow
comes with 2 outs, as seldom-used 3rd-string C Francisco Cabrera drives in
the tying and winning runs with a pinch-hit single. The backup catcher had
only three hits during the regular season. John Smoltz, who works 6 strong
innings without a decision, is named the series MVP.

1994
Bud Selig and Donald Fehr meet with President Clinton at the White House
in an effort to reach an agreement concerning the strike.

in game 4 of the NLCS. Mike Devereaux hits a 3-run homer, and Steve Avery
stars on the mound.

Cleveland evens the ALCS at 2 games apiece with a 7-0 win behind Ken
Hill. Eddie Murray and Jim Thome homer for the Indians, and Orel Hershiser
gets his 3rd victory of the postseason.

1996
The Braves batter the Cardinals, 14-0, in game 5 of the NLCS. John Smoltz
gets the win, with Fred McGriff and Javy Lopez contributing homers. Atlanta
sets a playoff record with 22 hits in the game.

1997
The Marlins win their 1st NL pennant by defeating the Braves, 7-4, and
winning the NLCS, 4 games to 2. Kevin Brown goes the distance for the
clincher, while Bobby Bonilla gets 3 RBIs to lead Florida. Keith Lockhart
has 4 hits for the Braves.

1998
The Padres finish off the Braves, as again Sterling Hitchcock and 4 relief
pitchers do the job, limiting Atlanta to just 2 hits in a 5-0 win. Tom
Glavine takes the loss for the Braves.

the ALCS. David Cone gets the win for NY, with help from a Tino Martinez
HR. Nomar Garciaparra accounts for both Boston runs with a 2-run roundtripper.

The Tigers fire manager Larry Parrish and hire former Brewer manager Phil
Garner to take his place, handing the former Brewers manager a 4-year contract
at $1.4 million a year. Detroit ignores Selig's directive to interview
minority candidates for the job, and hires Garner even before firing Parrish.

2000
Giving the Yankees a 3-1 lead in the ALCS, Roger Clemens strikes out a
record-setting 15 batters and one-hits the Mariners, 5-0.

The Cardinals defeat the Mets, 8-2, for their 1st win in the NLCS. Andy
Benes gets the win for St. Louis as all 9 Cardinal starters get hits.

The Yankees whitewash the Mariners, 5-0, behind Roger Clemens' 1-hit
shutout. Clemens fans 15 Mariners as New York moves out to a 3-games-to-1
lead over Seattle. The Yankees score their runs on a 3-run homer by Derek
Jeter and a 2-run blast by David Justice. Al Martin's double off the glove
of Tino Martinez in the 7th inning is the Mariners' only hit. The two team's
total of 6 hits ties an ALCS record for fewest safeties in a game.

2001
Seattle ties its series with Cleveland at 2 games apiece with a 6-2
victory. Down 1-0, the Mariners score 6 times over the final 3 innings. Edgar
Martinez' 2-run homer in the 9th caps the scoring as Freddy Garcia gets
the win.

Yankee bats finally come alive as New York defeats Oakland, 9-2, to even
their series at 2 games apiece. Orlando Hernandez gets the victory as
he improves his postseason mark to 9-1. OF Bernie Williams drives home 5
runs to lead the Yankees. Oakland OF Jermaine Dye fractures his leg when
he fouls a ball off his left shin. He will miss the rest of the postseason
and the start of spring training next year.

the single season homerun record with 55 along with Sadaharu Oh (1964)
and Tuffy Rhodes (2001).

The Giants beat the Cardinals, 2-1, to take the NLCS and move on to the
World Series against Anaheim. Kenny Lofton's base hit in the bottom of the
9th scores David Bell with the winning run. Tim Worrell gets the win in
relief for SF.

2003
The Giants announce that Pac Bell will be renamed SBC Park beginning January
1, 2004. The new name will change once again after the 2005 season as the
result of the SBC merger with AT&T.

David Wells hurls the Yankees to a 4-2 win over the Red Sox and a 3-games-to-2
lead in the ALCS. Karim Garcia's 2-run single in the 3rd is the key blow
for NY while Manny Ramirez homers for Boston.

Trailing 3-0 with 1 out in the 8th inning, the Marlins explode for 8 runs and
go on to defeat the Cubs, 8-3, to send the NLCS to a 7th game. A key play
occurs when a Cubs fan named Bartman reaches for a foul ball that Chicago
LF Moises Alou appears ready to catch at the edge of the stands. An error
by SS Alex Gonzalez and a bases-loaded triple by Mike Mordecai are other
key plays in the inning.

2004
The Cardinals use the long ball to go 1 up in their NLCS with a 6-4 win over

homer for Houston.

2005

the top choice for many other teams. A week later, GM Billy Beane and his
former field boss agree to a surprising new three-year deal.

The White Sox defeat the Angels, 5-2, to take the lead in the ALCS. Jon
Garland hurls a 4-hit complete game for the win and Paul Konerko gets 3

in relief, and Placido Polanco is named the series MVP. Jay Payton homers
in a losing cause for Oakland.

2010
In a widely anticipated hiring, the Braves sign Fredi Gonzalez to replace
their long-time legendary manager Bobby Cox, who retired at the end of the
season. Atlanta's new skipper, who served as the team's third-base coach from
2003-06, was unexpectely fired in June by the Marlins, a move which may have
been prompted by the benching of shortstop Hanley Ramirez for not hustling.

2020
The Dodgers set the Major League record for most runs in a single inning
in a postseason game by scoring 11 runs in the first inning of Game 3 of
the National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves.
