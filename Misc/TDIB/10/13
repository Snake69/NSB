Oct 13

1903
At the Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds, an overworked Deacon Phillippe
pitches his 5th complete game of the first-ever World Series, losing to
Bill Dinneen 3-0 in game 8 in 95 minutes. Only 7,455, the smallest crowd of
the Series, see Boston win the championship. Deacon's 5 decisions and 44 IP
are still WS records, as are his starting 2 straight WS games, twice. Hobe
Ferriss' 4th-inning single drives in the first of two runs in the inning.

1905
Joe McGinnity surrenders 5 hits, and Plank 4 hits, but 2 errors deal the
A's a 1-0 loss.

1906
Mound magic disappears as both Walsh and Reulbach are knocked out. Paced
by a WS-record 4 doubles by Frank Isbell, the White Sox win the slugfest, 8-6.

1907
In a three-way trade, the Highlanders receive 1B Jake Stahl from the White
Sox and send infielder Frank LaPorte to the Red Sox. Boston sends SS Fred
Parent to Chicago.

1908
In game 4, Three Finger Brown is in command all the way in a 3-0 four-hit
Cubs victory.

1909
Babe Adams hurls his 2nd complete-game victory, 8-4, despite a double and HR
by Sam Crawford. Fred Clarke's 3-run HR breaks a tie and gives the Pirates
a 3-2 Series lead.

1910
At the Polo Grounds, 25,000 fans show up for the start of the City Series
between the Giants and Highlanders, and to watch Christy Mathewson and
rookie phenom Russ Ford square off. The score is 1-1 when Mathewson and
Devore single in the bottom of the 8th. An error loads the bases and Ford
plunks Al Bridwell to score the winning run. The Giants score 3 more for
a 5-1 win, with Matty striking out 14 Highlanders. The American Leaguers
will win tomorrow when Jack Warhop tops Hooks Wiltse, but the Giants take
the game on the 15th when Matty preserves the 5-1 win for Drucke. Matty
will win game 4 by another 5-1 score.

In Ban Johnson's hearing on the October 9th doubleheader in which Nap
Lajoie had 8 hits, Browns 3B Red Corriden staunchly defends playing back:
"I wasn't going to get killed playing in on Lajoie."

1913
In St. Louis, the City Series between the Browns and the Cardinals ends in
a fight. In today's doubleheader, the Cardinals had taken the first game,
5-2, and the 2nd game is tied 1-1 after four innings when a brawl breaks
out. Since there had been several other fights in the series, and because
the series was played outside the auspices of the National Commission, the
umps announce they have had it, and retire to the clubhouse. The series ends
abruptly at 3 wins apiece, with one tie. Each Brownie player received $77.22.

1914
The first WS sweep in history belongs to the Braves - the only WS the
franchise will ever win. Bob Shawkey and Herb Pennock allow just 6 hits,
but one is a 2-run single by Evers, as Rudolph wins, 3-1. The American
League's A's were heavily favored. The Braves, who were in last place in
mid-July, won the National League pennant by ten and a half games.

1915
Back home, the Phils get 4 runs early off Rube Foster. The Red Sox break
a tie in the 9th for the 3rd time, as reliever Eppa Rixey gives up Harry
Hooper's 2nd solo HR of the game, both bounce homers into the crowd. Boston
wins the Series 4-1. The Sox victory comes without using Babe Ruth or Carl
Mays on the mound.

1917
Game 5 sees White Sox southpaw Reb Russell relieved by Ed Cicotte. Russell
gave up 2 hits and a walk to the first 3 batters he faced. In a sloppy
game marred by 3 New York and 6 Chicago errors, the White Sox break a 5-5
tie with 3 runs in the 8th. Red Faber, working the last 2 innings, is the
winning pitcher.

1921
In the first all New York World Series, at the Polo Grounds (home for both NY
teams), Waite Hoyt and Art Nehf come back for game 8 with 2 days rest. With 2
on and 2 outs in the first, Giants 1B George Kelly hits a grounder to short
that goes through Roger Peckinpaugh, and a run scores. Not another Giant
reaches 3B the rest of the day. After Aaron Ward walks in the 9th, Frank
"Home Run" Baker hits a drive toward right, but 2B Johnny Rawlings spears it
and throws him out while on the ground. Ward heads for 3B and is gunned down
by a throw from Kelly to Frisch to end the Series with a 4-3-5 DP. The Giants
win, 1-0. Hoyt does not allow an earned run in 3 complete games. The Giants
are the first to lose the first 2 games and come back to win the Series.

1923
The Yankees score 6 runs in the 2nd off 3 Giants hurlers to help a shaky
Bob Shawkey (16-11) to an 8-4 win. Whitey Witt has 3 hits and 2 RBIs; for
the losers Frank Frisch has 2 hits for the 3rd time, and Ross Youngs has 4.

In the PCL, Vernon whitewashes Los Angeles, 20-0.

1925
Back home for game 6 before 43,810, the largest crowd of the Series,
Pittsburgh's Ray Kremer (17-8) gives up a first-inning HR to Goose Goslin
and a run in the 2nd on Roger Peckinpaugh's RBI double. Joe Ferguson is
touched for 2 in the 3rd. The tie is broken by 2B Eddie Moore's HR, the
11th in the Series, and Pittsburgh wins, 3-2.

The Pirates buy SS Hal Rhyne and OF Paul Waner from San Francisco (PCL).

1926
Cleveland 1B George Burns is voted AL MVP. Hitting .358, Burns makes 64
doubles, topping Tris Speaker's 59. It'll be the record until Earl Webb's
67 in 1931.

1927
Dave Bancroft resigns as Braves manager; he will play for Brooklyn.

1937
The Sox top the Cubs, 6-1, to win the City series, 4-games-to-3. The Sox
have now won 15 of 22 meetings with one ending in a deadlock.

1946
Back in St. Louis, Harry Brecheen ties the Series again with a 4-1 win,
stopping the Red Sox on 7 hits.

1953
The Yankees buy the contracts of black players Elston Howard and Vic Power
from the Kansas City Blues. Power hit .349 for the Yankee farm club, while
Howard hit .286. Howard will spend next year in Toronto (International
League) while Power is trade bait.

1958
The commissioner fines 22 Milwaukee players $50 each for divulging their
WS share.

The ML fines Yankees P Ryne Duren $250 for giving the "choke" sign to an
umpire during the WS.

1960
At Forbes Field, in a 9-9 tie, Bill Mazeroski leads off the last of the 9th
and hits what is arguably the most dramatic homerun in Series history, off
Ralph Terry, to give Pittsburgh a 10-9 win and the World Championship. An
oddity in this game:  it is the only WS game this century with no strikeouts
recorded; it won't be until 2002 that even one team (the Angels) has a game
without a strikeout. Despite Maz' heroics, Bobby Richardson is the Series
MVP, as the Yanks outscore the Bucs, 52 to 27. Maz' round-tripper remains
the only homerun ever to win a World Series game 7.

1965
The Twins' Mudcat Grant does it all himself, hitting a 3-run HR and pitching
a 5-1 win at Minnesota to knot the WS with the Dodgers.

1970
In game 3 of the Fall Classic played at Memorial Stadium, Dave McNally goes
deep with the bases loaded in the bottom of the sixth inning off the Reds
right-hander Wayne Granger to become the first pitcher to hit a grand slam
in World Series history. The Oriole hurler's offensive output contributes
to the Birds' 9-3 victory over Cincinnati, and gives Baltimore a commanding
3-0 game advantage in the seven-game series. Frank Robinson and Don Buford
also contribute homers, and 3B Brooks Robinson continues his excellence
with the glove, as he makes 2 spectacular grabs in the field.

1971
At Three Rivers Stadium, Pittsburgh comes back from a 3-0 deficit to beat
Baltimore 4-3, as Milt May drives in the winning run in the 8th with a
pinch-hit single. Roberto Clemente has three hits in the game. It is the
first WS game to be played entirely under the lights.

The White Sox trade P Rich Hinton to the Yankees for Jim Lyttle.

1972

in the WS.

1973

3rd inning, allowing the A's to win, 2-1.

1974
Hall of Fame OF Sam Rice dies at Rossmor, Maryland, at age 84, leaving a
letter - opened at Cooperstown - confirming his controversial catch in the
1925 WS. The letter, dated July 26, 1965, details the entire play and ends
with Rice's punchline, "at no time did I lose possession of the ball."

Los Angeles, behind Don Sutton, evens the Series with a 3-2 win. The Dodgers
score in the 2nd off Vida Blue, and a 2-run HR by Joe Ferguson in the 6th
provides the margin.

The Cardinals trade Joe Torre to the Mets for pitchers Ray Sadecki and
Tommy Moore. Torre will not solve the Mets' 3B problems but he will be
named manager in 1977.

1976
The Royals even the Series again with a 7-4 win, despite 2 Graig Nettles
HRs. Freddie Patek is the big hitter with 3 RBIs.

first WS win, 5-1. Ron Guidry goes 9 innings and gets the victory.

1979

3-games-to-one advantage. Pinch-hit doubles by John Lowenstein and Terry
Crowley drive in 4 runs.

1981
Los Angeles takes game one of the NLCS, 5-1, over Montreal.

as Tommy John, Ron Davis and Goose Gossage combine to hold up Graig Nettles'
first-inning 3-run double, 3-1.

The Padres fire manager Frank Howard and his entire coaching staff. San
Diego finished last in the NL West in each half of the season.

1982
St. Louis rallies to win, 5-4, and even the WS.

1985
The Royals stave off elimination behind Danny Jackson's 8-hit shutout, 2-0,
over the Blue Jays.

The Cardinals rout the Dodgers, 12-2, to even the NLCS at 2-2, but also lose
rookie sensation Vince Coleman to one of the more bizarre injuries in ML
history. Coleman is stretching before the game when his left leg becomes
caught in Busch Stadium's automated tarpaulin as it unrolls across the
infield, trapping him for about 30 seconds. He is removed from the field
on a stretcher and will not play again this year.

1986

Frank Robinson is named the Associated Press Manager of the Year, easily
outdistancing the runner-up, Don Zimmer of the Cubs. The Hall of Famer

the history of the game, finishing the campaign 32 1/2 games better than
the club's last-place finish the previous year.

a playoff record.

2001
Being down 2-0 in the best-of-five series, the Yankees stave off elimination
beating the A's and Barry Zito, 1-0, thanks to the shutout pitching by Mike
Mussina and Mariano Rivera, and Jorge Posada's fifth-inning homerun. Shortstop
