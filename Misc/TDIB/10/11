Oct 11

1905
Today's game in Philley will be canceled because of wet grounds, though the
press speculates that the real reason is poor gate receipts. At game time,
the crowd was just 4,000, as threatening weather keeps many away.

1906
Pitching continues to dominate as Ed Walsh stops the Cubs on 2 hits. The
Sox manage just 4 off Jack Pfiester, but one is a triple by George Rohe,
with 3 on in the 6th, for a 3-0 win. Walsh fans 12, the record until 1929.

1907
Orval Overall gives up a triple to Cobb, but the Tigers are tamed again,
6-1, in game 4.

1908
In Chicago for game 2, Orval Overall doles out 4 hits, and the Cubs break
a scoreless deadlock with 6 in the 8th off Bill Donovan for a 6-1 win.

1909
At Bennett Park, paced by Honus Wagner's 3 hits, 3 RBIs and 3 stolen bases,
the visiting Pirates take game 3, 8-6. Nick Maddox is the winner over
Ed Summers. Wagner is the first player to steal three bases in a World
Series contest.

1911
The first MVPs are announced. Using a point system - 8 for a first-place
vote, 7 for 2nd, and so on - the 8 voting writers give OF Ty Cobb the
maximum 64 points or an efficiency rating of 1.000. P Ed Walsh is 2nd,
and 2B Eddie Collins 3rd. The NL winner is the Cubs OF Frank "Wildfire"
Schulte who garners an efficiency rating of .453, Schulte tops the 100 mark
in runs and RBIs, and is the only player in history to reach 20 in doubles,
triples, homers and stolen bases in the same season. Christy Mathewson is
2nd. Winners receive Chalmers automobiles.

In Richmond, the AL All-Stars beat the A's, 13-8, before 9,000. Cobb has

1913
John McGraw loses his 3rd straight WS. In game 5, Mathewson is good, but
Eddie Plank is better; his 2-hitter wins the 3-1 finale. Plank retires the
first 13 batters, bettering the mark of 12 set by the Cubs' Mordecai Brown
on Ocotber 9, 1906. Frank Baker at .450 and Eddie Collins at .421 lead a
strong A's offense.

1915
In Boston, an unprecedented 42,300 are on hand for game 3 and see another
1-1 duel, which is decided in the 9th when Duffy Lewis singles home Harry
Hooper for a 2-1 hometown win. Dutch Leonard walks none, yields 3 hits,
and sets down the last 20 Phils to face him.

1916
Rube Marquard, Larry Cheney, and Nap Rucker yield 10 hits as the Red Sox
win game 4 easily, 6-2. The Brooklyn Robins score twice in the first, but
Larry Gardner's 2nd HR, an inside-the-park blast, scores 3 in the 2nd and
puts Boston ahead to stay. Dutch Leonard holds his foes to 5 hits. Rucker's
2 innings are the last in the majors for the vet ... he hangs up his spikes
with a 134-134 record, all with Brooklyn.

1917
New York's Ferdie Schupp fares better against Red Faber in game 4; Benny
Kauff hits 2 HRs, which are more than enough for a 5-0 win to even the Series.

1920
In game 6, Brooklyn's P Sherry Smith gives up a 6th-inning single to Tris
Speaker and double to George Burns. That's all the scoring for the day,
as Brooklyn reject Duster Mails yields 3 hits for a 1-0 win and 4-2 lead
for Cleveland in the best-of-9 series.

1921
Miller Huggins gambles in game 6 with lefty Harry Harper (4-3), and the
Yankees drive Fred Toney (18-11) to cover with 3 in the first. But the
Giants come back with 3 in the 2nd, and continue the attack against Bob
Shawkey while Jess Barnes slams the door, striking out 10, including 7 in
a row sandwiched around 4 walks. Emil "Irish" Meusel and Frank Snyder homer
for the Giants in an 8-5 win. It is Barnes' 2nd WS win in relief.

9 hits for a 4-2 Yankee win at the Polo Grounds.

1925
Before a home crowd of 36,000, Walter Johnson wins his 3rd straight WS
contest over 2 years. He blanks the Bucs on 6 hits, only 2 out of the
infield, and fans just 2. A 3-run HR by Goose Goslin in the 4th followed
by Joe Harris' round-tripper - the first back-to-back HRs in WS history -
give the Senators a 4-0 win and 3-1 Series advantage. Veteran Babe Adams
gives up 2 hits but pitches a scoreless 9th for the Bucs. Babe's last WS
appearance was winning game 7 in the 1909 World Series.

1926
The Browns announce that George Sisler will be back as a player but not
as manager.

1927
Lou Gehrig, who established a new ML record with 175 RBIs, is named AL
MVP. With 56 points, Gehrig wins over Harry Heilmann's 35 and Ted Lyons'
34. Ruth is not considered because former winners are not eligible.

1929
In Philadelphia for game 3, Guy Bush (18-7) is tagged freely but the A's
strand 10; Earnshaw comes back with a 6-hitter, striking out 10, but 2 hits,
a walk and an error in the 6th produce 3 tallies for a 3-1 Cubs win. Cuyler's
2-run single is the key blow to back Bush's complete-game effort.

1934
Burleigh Grimes is released by the Pirates. He will sign next April 1 to
manage Bloomington and be given a dispensation to throw the spitball.

winning over Lee Stine.

1943
Bill Dickey's 2-run HR off Mort Cooper in the 6th gives the Yanks the
championship. Spud Chandler gives up 10 hits but strands 11 in the 2-0
victory. Chandler won 2 games and compiled a 0.50 ERA. A full share is
worth $6,139 to the New York players; the Cards get $4,321 each. The Series
grosses $1.1 million at the gate, receives $100,000 for broadcast rights,
and donates $308,000 to War Funds.

The Tigers swap OF Rip Radcliff to the A's for C Bob Swift and 2B Don
Heffner. Radcliff enters the Navy instead, finishing his ML career at 10
years, and the Tigers complete the deal with cash.

a complete-game win. All 3 runs off Dobson are unearned.

32-year-old pitcher Allie Reynolds (11-15). Columnist Dan Daniel will later
report that Larry MacPhail and Bucky Harris initially wanted Red Embree,
but DiMaggio advised them to take Reynolds. The Chief will be a mainstay
of the Yankees championship teams while Gordon will finish out the 1940s
with three good years. The Yanks will put Embree in pinstripes in a year.

1948
In game 6 of the Fall Classic, the Indians beat the Braves, 4-3, to win the
World Series. Bob Lemon gets the win with Gene Bearden pitching the final
1 2/3 innings to earn the save. Bill Voiselle takes the loss.

In a curious move, the Cubs sell P Russ Meyer to the Phillies. The "Mad Monk"
(10-10, 3 shutouts) was the only starter not under .500 and one of two
pitchers to win 10 games. Meyer will go 17-9 with the Phils in 1949. After
the Cubs beat Meyer and the Phillies next June 5, he will go 24-2 against
his old club as a member of the Phils and Dodgers.

1956

farm club in Minneapolis.

Phillies tie the NLCS at 2 games apiece with a 10-inning 5-3 win over the
Astros. In the 4th inning, Houston is deprived of an apparent triple play

the base early on Luis Pujol's would-be sacrifice fly.

with Toronto, will be selected as the series Most Valuable Player.

1986
Tom Gorman, a former National League umpire for 25 seasons and major league
pitcher who appeared in four games with the Giants in 1939, suffers a fatal

hand showing the count to be 3 and 2.

Trailing 3-0 entering the bottom of the 9th inning, California rallies for

The Phillies notch their 2nd 4-3 10-inning victory of the NLCS and take a
3-games-to-2 lead over the Braves. Lenny Dykstra's homer off Mark Wohlers is

contract. Lee, selected by the Twins in this year's amateur draft, was
declared a free agent on September 24th because Minnesota failed to offer him
a contract within 15 days of the end of the draft. Arizona outbid several
other teams for Lee's services. Lee's deal will be voided by major league
officials next week, and have to be reworked.

1997
The Orioles waste a masterful pitching performance from Mike Mussina,
as Cleveland scores a run in the bottom of the 12th inning when Marquis
Grissom steals home on a botched bunt attempt. Baltimore C Lenny Webster
fails to chase after the ball, which he is sure was tipped by batter Omar
Vizquel. Mussina gives up only 3 hits and 1 run in 7 innings, while striking
out 15 Indians. Orel Hershiser holds Baltimore scoreless through 7 innings,

pushing umpire Charlie Williams during Saturday's win over the Diamondbacks.

the Mariners in game 2, 7-1. The Orioles (game 1 - 1970), the Yankees
(game 2 - 1981) and the Blue Jays (game 3 - 1985) had previously each had
seven hits in one inning of a championship series. The Yankees score 7 runs

8th-inning HR is the deciding blow. Jarrod Washburn hurls 7 strong innings
for Anaheim, with Francisco Rodriguez getting the win in relief.

2003
In a game marked by several brawls, including a memorable one in which
Boston hurler Pedro Martinez throws 72-year-old New York coach Don Zimmer
to the ground, the Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 4-3, to take game 3 of the
ALCS. Zim's slow charge to the mound followed a Pedro pitch behind Karim
Garcia's head in the 4th inning. Garcia followed with a hard slide into
2B upending Todd Walker. When the Red Sox came to bat, Manny Ramirez took
exception to a pitch from Roger Clemens that sailed high. Although it is
barely inside, he shouts at Clemens, moving at him with bat in hand, and
both benches empty. Clemens posts the 11th postseason win of his career
while Derek Jeter homers for NY.

The Cubs pound the Marlins for an 8-3 victory and a 3-games-to-1 lead in
the NLCS behind Matt Clement. Aramis Ramirez' 1st-inning grand slam gives
the Cubs a lead they never relinquish. Ramirez also hits another homer
as the two teams combine to set a new record for most HRs in an NLCS with

the Giants and Cardinals last year.

gets the win for LA with the aid of a HR by Garret Anderson. Joe Crede
homers for Chicago.

due to rain.

2009
In the final game to be played at the Metrodome, the Yankees advance to
the ALCS by defeating the hometown Twins, 4-1. A costly eighth-inning
base-running blunder by Nick Punto ends Minnesota's hopes of a comeback
over a very talented New York team, which includes Alex Rodriguez, who went
5 for 11 with two homers and six RBIs in the three-game division series sweep.

Jonathan Papelbon, who had never given up a run in any of his previous 26
postseason innings, allows two inherited runners to score in the eighth,
and yields another three runs in the ninth giving the Angels, who trailed
5-1 going into the sixth inning, a 7-6 victory over the Red Sox. The Halos'
comeback victory at Fenway completes a three-game sweep of the ALDS over a
team which historically had been their nemesis having been eliminated from
the playoffs in their past four post-season encounters with Boston.

Admitting to a blown call, which led to the decisive run in the Rockies' 6-5
game-2 NLDS loss to the Phillies at a very chilly Coors Field, home plate
umpire Jerry Meals, after watching a post-game replay, states the ball,
that glanced off the Chase Utley's leg should have not been considered in
play. To make matters worse on the same play which was foul to begin with,
umpire Ron Kulpa rules the runner safe on a close call which appeared to
have the Philadelphia infielder beat at first base.

2010
With their 3-2 victory over the Braves in game 4 of the NLDS series at
Turner Field, San Francisco advances to the National League Championship
Series to play Philadelphia. After the last out of the game, the Giants
players come onto the field to salute the opposing manager, Bobby Cox,
who is retiring after 29 years in the dugout.

2012
For the first time since the divisional playoffs began in 1995, all four
series will go the distance to a game 5 when both the Nationals and Orioles
knot their respective series against the Cardinals and Yankees. Washington
and Baltimore join the A's and Giants who also forced a decisive game with
victories over the Tigers and Reds in yesterday's LDS games.
