Before 33,228 at the Polo Grounds, the Giants put 3 hits together off Coombs
in the last of the 9th for 2 runs and a 3-3 tie. The A's Eddie Plank comes
on in the 10th and gives up the winning run on Fred Merkle's sac fly to
Danny Murphy in the 4-3 contest. Larry Doyle scores from 3B leaping into
the arms of his joyous teammates and missing home plate for the 'phantom
run'. Ump Bill Klem notices it, revealing the fact after the game, but
the A's fail to appeal. Relief specialist Doc Crandall gets the win after
working 2 scoreless innings.

1927
Heinie Groh retires after being released by the Pirates; he signs to manage
in the minors.

three days ago.

1939
With 15 of the 24 first-place votes cast by the writers, Joe DiMaggio wins
his first American League MVP award, easily out-distancing runner-ups
Jimmy Foxx and Bob Feller. The Yankees outfielder will also capture the
prestigious prize in 1941 and 1947.

1947
Commissioner Happy Chandler suspends the Chicago White Sox from the American
League in a dust-up that started when the Sox inked prep star George Zoeterman
in violation of the ban against signing high school players. Sox GM Leslie
O'Connor argued that Zoeterman was a private school student and therefore
not covered, a position that earned him a $500 fine. O'Connor refused to
pay resulting in the suspension. On November 4, owner Lou Comiskey will
pay the fine and the AL will once again be 8 teams.

1955
The Indians trade Larry Doby, the first black to play in the American League,
to the White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. The future Hall of
Fame outfielder, who will hit .275 during his two seasons in Chicago,
will return to the Tribe in 1958.

Baseball great Branch Rickey steps down as GM of the Pirates and moves
into an advisory role with the Pirates. Joe L. Brown, son of the actor,
replaces him. During the "Mahatma's" five-year tenure, Pittsburgh will
endure three 100-loss seasons.

1956
White Sox manager Marty Marion resigns and will be replaced by Al
Lopez. Chicago's new skipper will pilot the Pale Hose to a 840-650 (.564)
record and an American League pennant during his 11-year tenure in the
Windy City.

1960
Gabe Paul announces his decision to leave the Reds to become the general
manager of the Colt .45's, an expansion team scheduled to begin play in

the team plays an official game.

1965
Leo Durocher becomes manager of the Cubs, replacing head coach Lou Klein
(48-58).

1972

for pitcher Jim Rooker. However, after a year Garber will move back to the NL.

1973
The Cubs trade 6-time 20-game winner Ferguson Jenkins to the Rangers for 3B
Bill Madlock and utility man Vic Harris. Fergie has led the Cubs in wins in
each of the past seven seasons, the only pitcher ever to do so and then be
traded. Meanwhile, the Giants trade 3-time HR champion Willie McCovey, a Giant
since 1959, together with a minor leaguer, to the Padres for P Mike Caldwell.

1975
The Reds swap P Joaquin Andujar to Houston for pitcher Carlos Alfonso and

in 1977, to the Giants on June 15, 1978.

1978
The Padres Gaylord Perry becomes the first pitcher to win the Cy Young
Award in each league (Cleveland, 1972). Perry copped the NL honors with

has won 15 or more games, second only to Cy Young's 15 straight 15+ seasons.

1981
In game 5 at Dodger Stadium, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager hit back-to-back
solo homeruns in the seventh inning off Yankee southpaw Ron Guidry giving
Los Angeles a 2-1 win, its third victory in the Fall Classic. Guerrero and
Yeager along with teammate Ron Cey will be named as the co-recipients of
World Series MVP award. After the game, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner
scuffles with 2 (he says) fans in a hotel elevator and emerges with a fat
lip and a broken hand.

1983
White Sox pitcher LaMarr Hoyt, who led the AL with 24 wins but whose 3.66
ERA was not among the league's 15 best, wins the AL Cy Young Award, beating
out the Royals' Dan Quisenberry and the Tigers' Jack Morris.

1985
The Angels announce that they will not offer 7-time batting champion Rod
Carew a new contract for the 1986 season, effectively ending his 19-year
career. Carew finishes with 3,053 hits and a .328 career batting average.

The Blue Jays name 3B coach Jimy Williams manager, replacing Bobby Cox,
who resigned to become GM of the Braves.

1986
Trailing 5-3 with 2 outs, 2 strikes and no one on base in the bottom of
the 10th inning, New York rallies to win game 6 of the World Series, 6-5,
and force a deciding 7th game. After Gary Carter, Kevin Mitchell and Ray
Knight single, Bob Stanley uncorks a wild pitch that permits the tying run
to score, and a hobbled Bill Buckner lets Mookie Wilson's slow bouncer skip
through his legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run. Reliever Calvin
Schiraldi absorbs the loss. This event was selected as one of baseball's
30 most memorable moments.

1987
In a series in which each team never loses a game in its home park, Series
MVP Frank Viola and reliever Jeff Reardon hold the Cardinals to 6 hits as
the Twins capture game seven, 4-2, to win their first World Championship
in Minnesota. The franchise's last World Championship came in 1924 as the
Washington Senators.

1993
The AL matches the NL by making Tim Salmon the unanimous choice for Rookie
of the Year. The Angels outfielder hit .283 with 31 homers and 95 RBIs.

1995
Anheuser-Busch, which has owned the Cardinals for 42 years, announces plans
to sell the team.

The Braves take a 3-games-to-1 lead in the Series with a 5-2 win behind
Steve Avery. Albert Belle, Manny Ramirez and Ryan Klesko all homer.

1997
Cleveland evens the Series for the 3rd time with a 4-1 victory behind Chad
Ogea. Ogea helps himself with the bat, getting a single and a double in 2
trips to the plate, and knocking in a pair of runs.

2000
The Yankees defeat the Mets, 3-2, to take a commanding 3-games-to-1 lead
in the Series. Derek Jeter homers off Bobby Jones on the 1st pitch of the
game for the Bronx Bombers. The Yankee bullpen saves the game with 4 1/3
innings of scoreless relief. Mike Piazza's third-inning 2-run homer (off
Denny Neagle) accounts for all the Mets scoring. Piazza is the first player
to hit a World Series homerun at both Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium.

Yankees OF Darryl Strawberry is arrested and jailed after leaving a treatment
center following a weekend drug binge.

2003
The Marlins win their 2nd world championship as World Series MVP Josh
Beckett hurls a 5-hit shutout in defeating the Yankees, 2-0, in game 6 of
the WS. Luis Castillo's 5th-inning single brings home Florida's 1st run, and
the only one Beckett needs as he outduels Andy Pettitte. Thus the Marlins
conclude their 2nd winning season in the past 11 years in the same manner
they concluded their first winning season.

2005
The first World Series game ever to be played in the state of Texas proves
to be memorable when Geoff Blum's 14th-inning solo homerun (30th MLer to
hit a HR in first WS AB) off Ezequiel Astacio becomes the beginning of
the end of the longest Fall Classic contest ever played. The 7-5 victory,
which gives the White Sox a commanding 3-0 advantage over the Astros,
takes 5 hours 41 minutes to complete with the 14 frames equaling the number
of innings the Red Sox needed to beat the Brooklyn Robins in game 2 of
the 1916 series. Mark Buehrle becomes the first pitcher to start and save
consecutive World Series contests. After receiving a no-decision starting
game 2, the 26-year-old southpaw gets the final out in the 14th inning to
record a save. Houston led, 4-0, before Chicago scored 5 runs in the 5th
inning off Roy Oswalt to take the lead. Joe Crede also homers for the Sox,
while Jason Lane connects for the Astros. Damaso Marte gets the win in relief.

Braves P John Smoltz is announced as the winner of the 2005 Roberto Clemente
Award for the player who best exemplifies baseball both on and off the field.

2006
Game 4 of the World Series is postponed due to rain.

Ryan Howard of the Phillies and Derek Jeter of the Yankees are named
winners of the Hank Aaron Award as the best overall hitter in the NL and
AL respectively.

2007
Hideki Okajima becomes the first Japanese-born player to pitch in the World
Series. The former Nippon Ham Fighters hurler comes out of the bullpen in
relief of Curt Schilling and retires seven straight Rockies, including Kazuo
Matsui making it the first time Japanese natives have faced one another in
the Fall Classic.

2009
The Indians sign 40-year-old Manny Acta to a three-year deal to be the
team's 40th manager in franchise history. The former Nationals field boss,
who was fired by Washington in July, is the first Cleveland skipper to be
hired outside the organization since John McNamara piloted the club in 1990.

Yusei Kikuchi decides not to entertain offers from American major league
teams, opting instead to start his professional career in his native
Japan. The 18-year-old left-handed flamethrower, who had interested scouts
from the Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Cubs, Giants, Tigers, Braves, Rangers,
Mariners and Indians, would have been the first Japanese high school student
to come directly to the U.S. to play pro ball.

With a 5-2 victory over the Angels at Yankee Stadium, New York wins its
40th American League pennant. The Bronx Bombers, after a six-year absence
from the Fall Classic, will play the Phillies in quest of their 27th World
Championship and the first since they beat the Mets in 2000.

2010
John Farrell emerges from the 18 candidates interviewed by Blue Jays general
manager Alex Anthopoulos to replace Cito Gaston, the team's recently retired
manager. The former Boston pitching coach's reputation of working well with
youthful hurlers is thought be a real asset for the team's new skipper,
given Toronto's talented young rotation.

2011
Canada wins their first major baseball tournament when Team Canada defeats
the United States, 2-1, at the Pan American Games played in Lagos de Moreno,
Mexico. Jimmy Van Ostrand's sixth-inning double, driving in Chris Robinson
and Tim Smith, both who had two-out singles to start the rally, proves to
be the difference in the gold medal game.

2014
Mo'ne Davis throws out the ceremonial first pitch before the Giants' 11-4
victory in Game 4 of the Fall Classic against the Royals at AT&T Park. The
13-year-old pitching phenom, the first girl to hurl a shutout in the Little
League World Series, continues her mastery on the mound, firing a strike
right down the middle of the plate.
