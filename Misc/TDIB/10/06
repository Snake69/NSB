Oct 6

1903
A travel day and rainout enable Phillippe to pitch and win again, 5-4,
before 7,600 at Pittsburgh. Boston rallies for three runs in the 9th but
it is not enough. Ginger Beaumont and Honus Wagner have 3 hits, but Honus
will manage just .222 for the WS.

The Highlanders trade vet C Jack O'Connor to his hometown St. Louis Browns
for another veteran, Norwegian born John Anderson.

1904
In the Cardinals' 10-1 loss to Pittsburgh, St. Louis P Jack Taylor hurls
his 39th consecutive complete game of the season - a modern ML record. His
streak started on April 15th and totals 352 innings pitched.

1905
The Athletics clinch the pennant while losing to the Washington Senators,
10-4, as St. Louis defeats the White Sox. Elmer Flick of the Cleveland Naps
leads the AL in batting with a .306 mark.

1906
Chick Stahl, Boston Americans player-manager, closes out the season and
his last career at-bat with an 8th-inning two-run homer off New York's Tom
Hughes. But Long Tom emerges with a 5-4 win.

Finishing with a 3-3 tie against the Cardinals, Chicago is the first team
to finish with fewer than 200 errors; their pitching staff has a combined
1.76 ERA.

1907
The first-place Cubs finish the season with a split at St. Louis, winning the
first game, 7-1, and losing game 2 by a 1-0 score. The Cubs finish the year
with a remarkable 1.73 team ERA, .57 points better than the runner-up. This
.57 difference will not be matched until the 2003 Dodgers do it with their
3.16 ERA.

The Reds and Pirates split their finales, with the Bucs winning the opener,
4-3, and the Reds taking game 2, 13-1 in 7 innings. The Reds collect 16
hits off young Babe Adams (0-2). Mike O'Neill finishes his ML career with
a triple off Babe for his second hit of the year. The first was also a triple.

In St. Louis, 18,000 turn out with a reported 5,000 turned away to see the
local Browns top the Series-bound Tigers, 10-4 and 10-3. The stars sit for
Detroit as manager Hugh Jennings starts game 1 at short, but finding the
throw too long, switches to 2B. Cobb attends the Cubs-Cards game.

In Chicago, the Leland Giants end their season with a 3-2 win over Milwaukee
as Rube Foster pitches a complete game for the win.

1908
Having been in 13 of the last 16 games, Ed Walsh does not start the White
Sox finale against Detroit. Doc White is hit hard in the 7-0 loss that
gives the pennant to the Tigers. Bill Donovan pitches a two-hitter.

Detroit OF Sam Crawford leads the AL with 7 HRs. Having led the NL with
16 in 1901, he becomes the first player to lead both leagues in that
department. The Cardinals have scored 372 runs, the lowest season total ever.

1909
Chicago Cubs' King Cole makes his major league debut a royal one by stopping
the Cardinals, 8-0, the first shutout for the Cubs in three weeks. It is
the Cubs' 32nd shutout of the year tying the ML mark set by the 1906 White
Sox and the 1907 Cubs.

In New York, the Highlanders and Tigers play a game for the benefit of Sam
Crane. Christy Mathewson and Joe McGinnity were the opposing pitchers. The
season is over for the Highlanders but Matty pitches even though his Giants
are still playing.

1910
Boston (NL) rookie OF Bill Collins hits for the cycle as the Braves demolish
the Phillies, 20-7. The next franchise player to match Collins will be
Albert Hall for the Atlanta Braves in 1987.

The Senators and Red Sox split a pair, with Boston taking game 1 by a score
of 5-2 and the Nats winning, 6-5 in 8 innings. Duffy Lewis has a homer in
game 2, while Clyde Milan scores in the 3rd inning on the front end of a
triple steal. When Walter Johnson relieves for Walker in the 6th inning,
Milan saves the win with a tumbling 2-out bases-loaded catch. Johnson has
a pair of K's to finish with an AL-high 313 ... his scheduled next start
against the A's will be washed out.

The Giants triple Brooklyn to win, 9-3. Brooks 2B Dolly Stark is 4 for 4
for 4, getting 4 hits in 4 at-bats and making 4 errors.

1911
Cy Young's farewell appearance in a ML game is a letdown as he loses to
Brooklyn's Eddie Dent, 13-3, in his 906th game. Dent goes 7 innings, Cy
just 6 1/3 giving up 11 hits. Brooklyn scores 8 in the 7th and Young's last
8 batters faced tally:  triple, single, single, single, single, double,
double, double. Weaver allows the last 2 runs in the frame. In game 1,
Big Ed Donnelly (5-10) closes out his 2-year career with a 1-0 shutout for
the Rustlers over Brooklyn.

1912
In Cincinnati, Pirates OF Owen "Chief" Wilson hits a 9th-inning 3-run
triple off the Reds' Frank Gregory, but trying to stretch it into a HR,
he is nipped at the plate. The Pirates roll, 16-6. Wilson's 36 triples is
a still-standing record not topped in the majors or minors.

Cubs 3B Heinie Zimmerman, 0 for 3 in a 4-3 win over St. Louis, has just 2
hits in the last week. But he holds on to seemingly win the Triple Crown,
leading by one in HRs and RBIs. Years later, a recount of the totals will
drop Zim from 103 RBIs to 99, and cost him the triple crown.

At the Remington Arms Company in Bridgeport Connecticut, Walter Johnson
and Nap Rucker fire fast balls through a tunnel of fine wires in an attempt
to clock their fastballs. In street clothes, both throw three pitches. The
rudimentary test clocks Johnson at 122 feet per second (82 mph) and Rucker
at 113 feet per second (77 mph) both on their 3rd throw.

1913
In a Series tuneup in New York, the Giants top the Phillies, 4-1, before
500 fans.

1914
The Brooklyn Robins (AKA the Dodgers) split with Boston - winning 3-2 and
losing 7-3 - and finish 5th, their highest finish since 1907. The Braves
lose regular 3B Red Smith, who breaks his right leg sliding into 1B.

In the Federal League, the Chicago Whales lose to Kansas City while the
Indianapolis Hoosiers beat St. Louis, giving Indianapolis a 1 1/2 game
pennant margin. Five .300 hitters, led by Benny Kauff's .370, pace the
winners. For the Whales, Claude Hendrix is the FL's top pitcher at 29-11.

1915
The Boston Braves end the season by shutting out the Giants in a doubleheader
in New York, winning the opener, 1-0, behind Tom Hughes' 2-hitter and taking
the nitecap by the same score. Pat Ragan is the winner in 67 minutes.

In the 2nd game of a doubleheader, Boston's 28th twinbill of the year,
Babe Ruth beats New York, 4-2, to sweep the two. Ruth is now 17-3 since
June 1st. Boston takes the opener, 2-0, as Shore, Leonard, Wood and Mays
split the mound duties with each one striking out 3 Yankees. A crowd of
714 is at the Polo Grounds.

Rookie Elmer Myers makes a spectacular debut with the A's by striking out
12 Washington batters, while allowing just two hits. Myers walks 5 in the
4-0 win, his only game this year. Elmer will go 14-23 in 1916, but strike
out an impressive 182 batters in his rookie season.

1917
Before the WS starts, Charles Comiskey offers one percent of his team's
WS share to Clark Griffith's Bat and Ball Fund for American soldiers in
France. In Chicago, Happy Felsch's HR is the difference as Ed Cicotte beats
the Giants' Slim Sallee, 2-1, in the Series opener.

1919
After a Sunday rainout, Hod Eller blanks the Sox on 3 hits, fanning 6 in a
row - Gandil, Risberg, Ray Schalk, Williams, Leibold and Eddie Collins -
in the 2nd and 3rd. Once again a big inning gives the Reds a victory. A
couple of hits, some slow fielding, and poor throws by Jackson and Happy
Felsch result in 4 Reds scoring in the 6th for a 5-0 win, their 4th in
5 games. Lefty Williams is the loser. Sox C Schalk is the 2nd man to be
thrown out of a WS game when he disagrees with the call on Heinie Groh's
slide at home.

1920
When Wheeler Johnston pinch-hits for Cleveland in the 9th inning of game 2,
his brother Jimmy is playing 3B for Brooklyn. They become the first brothers
to take opposite sides in a WS. Spitballer Burleigh Grimes (23-11) strands
10 Indians while the Robins chip away at Jim Bagby (31-12) for 3 single
tallies and a 3-0 Series evener.

Hal Chase and Heinie Zimmerman are indicted on bribery charges as an aftermath
of the investigation into the 1919 World Series. John McGraw testified
that he dropped the two after the 1919 season for throwing games and trying
to entice Fred Toney, Rube Benton and Benny Kauff to join them. Zimmerman
denies the charges and Chase ignores them, but the duo will be banned for
life from baseball by Judge Landis.

1921
In the opener, Johnny Rawlings and Frank Frisch collected the only Giants
hits. In game 2 it's the same story. Waite Hoyt (19-13) surrenders 2 singles
in another 3-0 Yankee win. Art Nehf (20-10) deserves better, allowing just 3
hits; but 3 errors and 2 mental lapses by the Giants, plus a steal of home
by Bob Meusel, put the Giants down 2-0. The 5 hits are the fewest ever in
a WS game.

1922
The Giants' Jack Scott (8-2 with the Giants) fires a 4-hitter as a surprise
starter in game 3, after Hugh McQuillan (6-5 with NY) warms up to face Waite
Hoyt (19-12). Scott gets the Yanks to hit 18 grounders. Frank Frisch's 2 RBIs
are more than enough in the 3-0 win. With 2 hits in each game so far, Frisch
will bat .471. Heinie Groh, hitting safely in every game, will be at .474.

1923
Braves rookie SS Ernie Padgett, playing in his 2nd game, pulls an unassisted
triple play against the Phils, the first in the NL since 1878. Walter Holke
lines out, Cotton Tierney is forced, and Cliff Lee is tagged out. It is the
first unassisted TP in the NL since 1878. The Braves win the 5-inning nitecap,
4-1, to sweep the twinbill. Joe Batchelder picks up the W over Lefty Weinert.

Against the Indians, Chicago rookie Ted Lyons (2-1) picks up his first
two wins in the majors, both in relief. Lyons tosses 4 2/3 innings in the
opener and three innings in the nitecap as the White Sox sweep, 6-3 and
7-6. They're his only wins this year.

1924
Washington's surprise starter Firpo Marberry (11-12) and the Giants'
starter Hugh McQuillan (14-8) will be gone by the 4th. The Giants lead,
3-0, after 3 and are never caught, for a 6-4 victory. The only HR is hit by
Giants reliever Rosy Ryan; it is the only HR he hits in 6 years at New York.

1925
Brooklyn sends OF Eddie Brown, INF Jimmy Johnston, and C Zack Taylor to
the Braves for righty Jesse Barnes, OF Gus Felix and C Mickey O'Neil.

1926
In game 4, the Yankees tee off on Flint Rhem (20-7) and 4 other Cardinal
hurlers for 10 runs and 14 hits, while Waite Hoyt (16-12) strands 10 Cardinal
runners for a 10-5 win. Babe Ruth hits 3 HRs to fulfill his October 1st
promise to bedridden 11-year-old Johnny Sylvester. Ruth's 3rd clout, in
the 6th, is the longest blast ever seen in St. Louis. It clears the park
and goes through the window of an auto dealer across the street. In the
4th, Taylor Douthit and Chick Hafey collide in the OF as the ball drops;
Douthit is sidelined for the rest of the Series. Ruth becomes the first
player to hit three homeruns in a World Series game. History will repeat
itself in the fourth game of the 1928 Fall Classic when the 'Sultan of Swat'
goes deep three times again in St. Louis against the Redbirds.

1927
Two 3-run outbursts by the Yankees off Vic Aldridge (15-10) and a steady
7-hitter by surprise New York starter George Pipgras (10-3) give the Yankees
a 6-2 win. Mark Koenig has 3 hits.

1929
While the 3rd-place Indians lose two to the 4th-place Browns, 4-2 and
4-1, Cleveland's Joe Sewell finishes a 152-game schedule with just
4 strikeouts. The Browns bid farewell to Dan Howley as Bill Killefer is
signed to manage the Browns next year. The Reds will hire Howley as their
manager on October 15.

The Tigers score 4 in the top of the 9th to beat the White Sox, 7-6. Detroit's
Bob Johnson has 2 doubles and a triple to top 200 hits for the year. He
joins Dale Alexander (215) as the only two rookie teammates to ever top
200 hits. Among the 800 fans is Donie Bush, 1930 manager of the Comiskeys.

At Boston, the Giants close the season by beating the Braves, 9-4. In the 9th,
the Braves put in 2 coaches, Johnny Evers at 2B and Hank Gowdy at catcher,
Gowdy's 10th game of the year. Roy Parmelee is the winner with Red Lucas
pitching the last 4 innings. Lucas leads the NL in complete games (28)
and pinch hits ... Lucas hits .293 in 140 at-bats.

Former hurler Nick Altrock, 53, now a coach-comedian for the Senators, plays
one inning in RF and collects a single in his one AB against the Red Sox,
2-1 winners over Washington. Other graybeards making season-ending token
appearances include Browns coach Jimmie Austin, 49; Braves coach Johnny
Evers, 48.

At Wrigley Field, Larry French of the Pirates beats the Series-bound Cubs,
8-3. Batting practice pitcher Hank Grampp lasts just an inning in losing. The
Cubs end the season with an attendance of 1.6 million, a figure they will
not top until 1969.

Bill McKechnie signs a 4-year contract to manage the Braves.

1930
The A's take the lead in the Series, 3 games to 2, when George Earnshaw and
Lefty Grove combine to shut out the Cardinals, 2-0, on 3 hits. Philadelphia's
runs come in the top of the 9th when Burleigh Grimes is tagged for a long
2-run HR by Jimmie Foxx.

1931
The A's George Earnshaw evens the WS with a 3-0 shutout, giving up just 2
hits, both to the red-hot Pepper Martin. Jimmie Foxx hits a ball over the
LF stands, judged one of the longest drives ever at Shibe Park.

1933
Carl Hubbell wins for the 2nd time, going 11 innings for the 2-1 victory
in a pitching duel with Monte Weaver. Heinie Manush is thrown out of the
game for brushing umpire Charlie Moran in the 6th inning. Travis Jackson
beats out a surprise bunt to open the 11th inning, is sacrificed to 2B on
a close play, and scores on a single by Blondy Ryan.

1934
It is the Cardinals turn to play poorly, and they make 5 errors to lose,
10-4. Dizzy Dean, used as a pinch runner, is carried off the field after
being hit in the head by Billy Rogell's throw. Hank Greenberg ties the WS
record with 4 hits.

1935

win. He leaves because of a sore shoulder and Bill Lee relieves in the 3-1
victory. Chuck Klein hits a 2-run homer.

1936

pitcher. In the 6 games the Yankees score 43 runs to the Giants' 23.

1937
Carl Hubbell and Lefty Gomez duel in the opening game of the WS, a rematch of
last year's teams. The Yankees score 7 runs in the 6th inning on 5 singles,

the final score 8-1.

1938
Lefty Gomez sets a record with his 6th WS victory without a loss, defeating
the Cubs, 6-3, with relief help from Johnny Murphy. Dizzy Dean takes a 3-2
lead into the 8th but Frank Crosetti and Joe DiMaggio contribute two-run
homers for the Yankee win.

in Independence, MO, but both players decide to play in the WS. Mort is 1
for 3 and goes on to beat the New York Yankees, 4-3, resurrecting memories

Marion and Ray Sanders homer. Mort leaves for home after the game ... Walker
will follow on October 11.

holiday of Yom Kippur.

1966
Jim Palmer becomes the youngest player to pitch a shutout in the World Series

6-0. The contest will become more memorable next month when Koufax surprises
the baseball world by announcing his retirement making this game his last
major league appearance. Willie Davis establishes a World Series record by
