column, Christy Mathewson takes the mound for game 3 against 29-game winner
Jack Coombs. Matty takes a 1-0 lead into the 9th. With one out, Baker lines
another drive over the RF fence to tie it. With that blow, he becomes
"Home Run" Baker to future generations. Errors by 3B Buck Herzog and SS

next week with 4 years remaining on his contract.

Cuellar to put the Pirates ahead, 1-0. The right-fielder has hit safely in
all seven games of the series, a feat he also accomplished in 1960 against
the Yankees, to extend his consecutive Fall Classic hitting streak to 14
contests. Immediately after the game-7 victory, rookie hurler Bruce Kison
and his champagne-soaked best man Bob Moose are whisked away from Memorial
Stadium by helicopter to a waiting Lear Jet to attend the 21-year-old's

earns the win.

of Atlanta in their NLCS. Robin Ventura's grand slam in the bottom half
of the 15th wins it for NY, but his Met teammates mob him before he can
reach 2nd base. He never completes his round of the bases and gets credit
for a single instead of a grand slam. The Braves leave a postseason-record
19 players on base in the contest. The Mets use 9 pitchers in the game,
with rookie Octavio Dotel getting the win.

because of being overwhelmed by the situation.

2003
Early editions of the N.Y. Post include an editorial claiming the Yankees

Boston, while Alex Rodriguez homers for NY.

National League crown, after the first two batters are quickly retired,
is 'pulperized' when Albert Pujols hits a two-out three-run ninth-inning
homer off Brad Lidge. A two-strike single stroked by David Eckstein and a
walk worked out by Jim Emmonds set the stage for the Cardinals' dramatic
5-4 comeback. Jason Isringhausen gets the win in relief for St. Louis.
