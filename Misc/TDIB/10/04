Oct 4

1902
When Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss demands a game be played despite a
rain-soaked Exposition Park field, Cincinnati plays most of its team out of
their normal positions. The Pirates insist on playing for a record 103 wins
so the Reds show their displeasure when Kelley, Seymour and Donlin all smoke
cigarettes while playing in the field. First sacker Jake Beckley starts on
the mound for the only time in his career, pitching four innings and giving
up 8 runs, 4 earned. Outfielder Cy Seymour follows. This is Seymour's last
pitching appearance as the versatile player finishes his pitching career
with a 63-56 mark. Turkey Mike Donlin finishes up. Reds rookie pitcher
Rube Vickers tries his hand at catching, and sets a modern ML record with
6 passed balls to help Pittsburgh win, 11-2. [It is also a record for both
teams in a game. Vickers makes no effort to retrieve wide pitches, and it's
a surprise he only has six passed balls.] But Dreyfuss refunds the fans'
money and the Reds return their share of the gate to keep the irate fans
from wrecking the stadium.

At Boston, the Senators splits a doubleheader with New York, beating Christy
Mathewson, 5-2. It is Matty's 17th loss of the year. Iron Joe McGinnity
wins the nitecap for New York, 5-1.

1904
In the first of two at New York, the Giants lose to the Cardinals, 7-3,
despite Sam Mertes contribution of 4 hits for the cycle. New York drops the
2nd game in a forfeit in the 4th inning. With New York losing, 2-1, three
Giants are tossed out by umpire James Johnstone, a Giants nemesis. John
McGraw is slow in replacing them on the field, and the ump declares a
forfeit to St. Louis. One paper states tomorrow that McGraw didn't have
enough players left on the bench to field a team.

1905
Just one point apart in the batting race on the final day of the season,
Cincinnati Reds centerfielder Cy Seymour and Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop
Honus Wagner play against each other in a doubleheader. Seymour entered
the day with a league-leading .365 average and Wagner was in second place
batting .364. A very good day at the plate for Honus combined with a poor one
for Cy would have reversed their positions. Seymour had four hits in seven
attempts to end up with the National League batting championship (.377)
while Wagner collected two for seven to end up in second place (.363). A
newspaper account of the day stated "... 10,000 were more interested in
the batting achievements of Wagner and Seymour than the games ... cheer
upon cheers greeted the mighty batsmen upon each appearance at the plate ..."

1906
The Cubs score their record 116th win of the year (.763 winning percentage),
beating the Pirates, 4-0, in Pittsburgh. The winner is Jack Pfiester,
who notches his 20th victory. The win gives Chicago a 60-15 road record,
an .800 percentage mark that has never been equaled.

Boston (NL) hurlers Vive Lindaman and Irv Young lose, 3-2 and 2-1, to
Brooklyn. The Beaneaters finish last with 102 losses. Four hardworking
hurlers bear the brunt:  Young and Gus Dorner each lose 25 games; Lindaman,
23; and Frank "Big Jeff" Pfeffer, 22.

At the Polo Grounds, the Giants light up Tully Sparks for 6 runs in the
first inning, and Mathewson coasts to a 7-6 win over the Phils. Matty ends
the season at 22-12.

1907
The Senators and the A's split a year-end doubleheader. Rookie Walter Johnson
beats Eddie Plank, 2-1, to finish at 5-9. Spitballer Jimmy Dygert wins his
21st for the A's, beating Tom Hughes, 8-0.

26-year-old Reds pitcher Frank Leary dies following an operation for
appendicitis when he fails to come out of the anesthesia. Leary (0-1)
pitched in 2 games in 1907 with a 1.13 ERA.

1908
The Cubs and Pirates play their last game of the year before 30,247, the
largest crowd ever at Chicago's West Side Grounds. The Cubs win, 5-2, behind
Three Finger Brown to eliminate the Pirates. Chicago ends the year at 98-55
while the Pirates finish at 98-56. Then they await the results of the 3 Giants
games with Boston. Back in Pittsburgh, 50,000 people watch the progress of
the Cubs' game on temporary scoreboards. Fans fill New York's Polo Grounds
to watch the action in the same way. Men with megaphones announce each pitch.

On Chicago's South Side, 22,000 fans jam the grounds for the showdown
between the Tigers and the White Sox. The Sox manage to score 3 runs in the
1st inning without a hit, and tally just a lone single, in the 4th inning,
off Ed Killian to win, 3-1. Frank Smith is the winning pitcher.

In St. Louis, Cleveland ends up with a frustrating 3-3 tie with the Browns
when umpire Jack Egan makes a controversial out call against the Naps at
1B. Most observers thought that Hinchman beat the 9th-inning throw, but
Egan's call results in a tie game.

1910
In Philadelphia's 3-1 win at Boston, the A's Eddie Collins swipes his 81st
base to set a new AL record. Cobb will break it next year by 2.

1911
At Washington Park, the Giants clinch the pennant with a 2-0 victory over
Brooklyn. Mathewson allows 7 hits in besting Nap Rucker.

1912
After playing an exhibition game in Ray Chapman's hometown of Herrin,
Illinois, the Cleveland Naps board a train for the season finale in
St. Louis. The train is in an accident in Southwick, MO and, while no
players are injured, the engineer is killed.

1913
Despite the Dodgers' 6th-place finish, 1B Jake Daubert earns a new Chalmers
automobile as the NL MVP. Daubert led the NL at .350 and will repeat his
batting title in 1914.

Washington manager Clark Griffith uses an unheard-of 8 pitchers in an
end-of-season farce game with Boston, including 5 in the 9th inning. At
age 43, he pitches one inning himself, and coach John Ryan, also 43,
catches. Griffith also plays RF, where he plays one off his head and misplays
Hal Janvrin's liner into an inside-the-park homer. On the other end of the
scale, 17-year-old Merito Acosta plays outfield alongside Walter Johnson in
CF. Johnson then comes in the 8th inning to lob pitches to 2 hitters. Both
batters, Clyde Engel and Steve Yerkes lace hits to send Johnson back to
CF, and then, in relief, Nat's catcher Eddie Ainsmith, in his only ML
pitching appearance, gives up two triples to allow the base runners to
score. The Sox score in the 9th on Hal Janvrin's 2nd inside-the-park homer
of the game. Joe Gideon, in his only pitching appearance retires the last
two batters as Washington wins, 10-9, beating Fred Anderson who goes the
distance. The 2 runs "allowed" by Johnson will have historical repercussions:
his ERA goes from 1.09 to 1.14, and Bob Gibson's 1.12 ERA in 1968 will put
Johnson's ERA in 2nd place on the all-time list. The 8 pitchers sets a ML
record that won't be matched until the Dodgers on September 25, 1946.

At Detroit, White Sox pitcher Reb Russell gives Chicago a split by beating
Detroit, 1-0, in the nitecap following a 7-5 loss. Russell (22-16) sets
a ML rookie record with his 8th shutout. He also ties the ML record of
winning five complete 1-0 games in a season set by Walter Johnson, a mark
since tied in each loop but never topped.

1916
The New York Yankees take a pair from the visiting Washington Senators,
winning 4-3 and 5-1. Yankees rightfielder Tim Hendryx has three stolen
bases in game one and teammate Wally Pipp chips in with a tie-breaking
two-run homer in the 8th. Urban Shocker allows just 3 hits in game 2 and
the Yanks score a pair off Charlie Jamieson, an outfielder who pitches the
last 4 innings. The New Yorkers bat last in both games, though they batted
first in a few home games this season, the last team to do so. The rule is
changed in 1950 requiring the home team to bat last.

1917
After Brooklyn beats the Braves, 5-1 in game one, Boston responds with a
4-2 victory in the nitecap. Southpaw Art Nehf's 40-inning scoreless streak
is ended by the Robins in the 8th when a walk, single and sac fly produce
a score. He holds on for the win over Leon Cadore and finishes the year at
17-8 for the 6th-place Braves. In game one, Sherry Smith evens his season's
record, beating Jack Scott.

In the season closer, Washington's Jim Shaw tops the Red Sox, 5-4, despite
giving up 13 hits. The Senators tally 14 safeties off Herb Pennock. By
winning his 15th game, Shaw earns a $500 bonus.

In the tune-up for their battle with the White Sox, the Giants lose a
warm-up game to the Cubs in Chicago, 9-5. Vaughn gives up all five New
York runs in his 3 innings, but Carter and Hendrix in their three-inning
stints are clean. Al Demaree goes 8 innings against his old teammates,
and will sit on the bench for the Series.

1919
Ed Cicotte makes 2 errors in one inning of game 4 to give the Reds the only
runs of the game. He walks none and gives up 5 hits, but Jimmy Ring gives
up only 3 hits and wins, 2-0.

1922
For the first time, the entire WS will be broadcast over the radio. Writer
Grantland Rice does the announcing for station WJZ, Newark; it is relayed
to WGY in Schenectady.

For the first time since 1908, two repeaters meet in the WS. The Yankees
get there with an all righthanded starting pitching staff; the Giants on
a .305 BA. In a return to the 7-game format, the Giants will win 4 games
while scoring in only 5 innings. The Yankees' Joe Bush (26-7) leads Art Nehf
(19-13), 2-0, when Irish Meusel's 2-run single and Pep Young's sacrifice
fly score 3 runs in the 8th for a 3-2 win in game 1. Rosy Ryan (17-12)
gets the win in relief.

1923
Cleveland's Tris Speaker connects against the Browns for his 57th double
as the visiting Tribe win, 5-1. His final total of 59 is a record that will
be beaten in 1931 by Earl Webb (67), but his career-high 793 (later revised
down to 792) is still tops.

Tigers P Herman Pillette loses, 9-6, to Chicago for his AL-high 19th loss
of the season. His son Duane will tie for the lead in the AL with 14 losses
in 1951.

Allan "Rubber-Arm" Russell pitches in his 52nd game for Washington, a 7-6
loss to Boston. A record 47 are in relief. He also works 145 innings as a
"fireman," another new mark. He finishes the season with a 9-4 record,
9 saves, and a 2.55 ERA in relief.

In his last appearance for the Yankees, Carl Mays has no magic left as the
A's finally sink the submariner, 7-6, knocking him out of the box with 4
runs in the 5th. He had won 24 straight games against the A's. Mays strikes
out none, and gives up 10 hits and 3 walks. He will not appear in any of
the WS games. Ruth, filling in for Pipp at 1B, clubs his 39th HR in the
1st. Eddie Rommel, in relief, is the winner.

1924
For the 4th straight year, the Giants are in the Series. At 3B is Fred
Lindstrom, at 18 years 10 months, the youngest ever to play in a WS. President
Calvin Coolidge (the first U.S. President to attend a World Series opener)
is among 35,760 who jam the DC stands in game 1 as an Army band greets
the two teams by playing Sidewalks of New York and Dixie. George Kelly
drops a HR into the temporary bleachers in the 2nd, and Terry does the
same in the 4th for a 2-0 New York lead. Art Nehf (14-4) gives up one in
the 6th. In the last of the 9th, the Senators score to send the game into
extra innings. The Giants net 2 runs in the 12th. In the last of the 12th,
Washington scores one, but the rally falls a run short, and Walter Johnson
(23-7) loses his WS debut. Johnson strikes out 12 in the loss. Nehf becomes
the 5th pitcher to get 3 hits in a WS game, a feat that will not be repeated
until Orel Hershiser does it in 1988.

1925
For the first time in the 50-year history of the franchise, the Cubs end the
season in last place. The team, managed by Bill Killefer (33-42), Rabbit
Maranville (23-30), and George Gibson (12-14), compile a 68-86 record and
finish 27 1/2 games behind the first-place Pirates.

Harry Heilmann gets 6 hits in Detroit's doubleheader sweep over the Browns,
10-4 and 11-6, to edge out teammate Ty Cobb for the batting crown, .393
to .389. Cobb bats over .300 for the 20th time. In the 2nd game, the final
game of the season, managers George Sisler of the Browns and Ty Cobb of the
Tigers both pitch in relief for their 2 clubs, won by Detroit, 11-6. Cobb
is perfect in his one inning, while Sisler holds the Tigers scoreless in two.

In the nitecap following an 8-1 loss, the Phils' Dutch Ulrich shuts out
the Giants, 3-0. The NL tallies a National League record-low of 49 shutouts
this year.

The series-bound Pirates end the season splitting with the Reds, winning,
4-2, before losing, 4-1.

1928
The Cardinals lack the Yankees' power, but have a .325 hitter in Jim
Bottomley, who is tied with Hack Wilson for NL HR honors with 31 and leads
in RBIs with 136. St. Louis has a solid infield defense with Frankie Frisch,
the venerable Rabbit Maranville, and their fleet OF, led by Taylor Douthit,
whose 547 putouts and 566 total chances in CF have set post-1900 records. The
first game is a swift execution before 61,425 at New York. Babe Ruth has
a single and double and scores twice, once on Bob Meusel's 4th-inning HR,
and Lou Gehrig is 2 for 4 with 2 RBIs off Bill Sherdel (21-10). Waite Hoyt
(23-7) sets the Cards down with 3 hits, one a solo HR by Bottomley in the
7th, for a 4-1 win.

1930
Bill Hallahan blanks the A's, 5-0, giving up 5 walks and 7 hits. Philadelphia
A's hurler Jack Quinn, at age 46, pitches 2 innings of relief against the
St. Louis Cardinals, thereby becoming the oldest player to appear in a
WS game.

1932
Clark Griffith announces that Walter Johnson will not be the manager of
the Senators in 1933.

1933
Scoring 6 runs in the 6th inning, the Giants make it 2 in a row over
Washington. The Senators are again held to 5 hits.

1934
Schoolboy Rowe evens the Series with a 12-inning 3-2 win, shutting out
the Cardinals over the final 9. Rowe retires 22 batters in a row equaling
Pennock's effort in 1927. The Tigers tie the game in the 9th inning and
win on Goose Goslin's single.

1935
In game 3 of the World Series, AL umpire George Moriarty chases Chicago
manager Charlie Grimm and SS Billy Jurges in the 3rd inning. After Chicago
ties the game in the bottom of the 9th, Detroit scores an unearned run to
win in 11. Grimm is the first manager tossed since Frank Chance, in 1910.

1936
Another attendance record is set at Yankee Stadium, with 66,669 people
watching Lou Gehrig lead the way to a 5-2 win behind Monte Pearson's pitching.

1937
Cincinnati releases 38-year-old Kiki Cuyler. He will sign with
Brooklyn. Shortstop Leo Durocher is traded to the Dodgers by the Cardinals
for OF Johnny Cooney, Joe Stripp, Jim Bucher and Roy Henshaw. Cooney, who
started his ML career as a pitcher in the 1920s, led the AA in hitting in
1935 with a .371 average. Durocher will start at shortstop for the next 2
seasons in Brooklyn.

1939
The WS, with the Yankees as heavy favorites, begins in New York. The pitching
of Red Ruffing for New York and Paul Derringer for Cincinnati produces a
tense, low-scoring duel that is tied 1-1 until the last of the 9th, when
Yankees C Bill Dickey singles home DiMaggio with the winning run.

1940
Detroit bombs 9 hits for 19 bases in the 7th and 8th innings off Jim Turner
and successors to win, 7-4, in the first game at Briggs Stadium. Tommy
Bridges gives up 10 hits but goes the distance.

1941
In the 7th inning of a scoreless tie, Yankees pitcher Marius Russo breaks P
Fred Fitzsimmons' knee with a line drive off the kneecap. The ball caroms
to Reese who throws him out to end the inning. The Yankees score 2 in the
8th off Hugh Casey to win, 2-1. Fitzsimmons will pitch in just one game in
1942 before retiring to the coaching ranks.

1942
The Cards get 6 runs in the 4th, but the Yankees tie the game with 5 in
the 6th. St. Louis scores 3 more runs to win, 9-6, in a 22-hit game.

In a rematch of last year's IBA world championship, Cuba tops Venezuela,
8-0, behind Connie Marrero's 3-hitter. Venezuela is led by 2B Luis Aparicio
Sr and losing pitcher Chino Canonico. Marrero will debut with the Washington
Senators in 1950.

1944
The first all-St. Louis WS opens with the Browns, as the visiting team,
beating the Cardinals, 2-1, on George McQuinn's HR. Denny Galehouse is
the winning P and Mort Cooper loses despite allowing just 2 hits. It is
the first Series in which all the games are played west of the Mississippi
River. The Series is dubbed the Streetcar Series and is played with no days
off. Red Hayworth is behind the plate for the Browns, with Frank Mancuso
as his backup. In a family oddity, brothers Ray Hayworth and Gus Mancuso
also catch in the big leagues.

1945
Returning war vets Virgil Trucks and Hank Greenberg produce a 4-1 Detroit
win. Trucks, who pitched in only 5 innings of one game at the end of the
season, pitches a complete game, giving up 7 hits ... he did win a game
during the regular season. Greenberg's 3-run HR in the 5th wins the game.

1947
Frank Shea throws a 4-hitter and helps his own cause with 2 singles, as
the Yankees win, 2-1, in game 5. A Joe DiMaggio HR in the 5th is the margin.

In the Negro League WS, Luis Tiant Sr, and Pat Scantlebury pitch the New
York Cubans to a 6-5 win over the Cleveland Buckeyes in the final game.

1948
In a one-game playoff for the AL pennant at Fenway Park, the Cleveland
Indians beat the Boston Red Sox, 8-3, behind rookie knuckleballer Gene
Bearden, who wins his 20th game. Red Sox manager Joe McCarthy ignores
the well-rested rotation pitchers Ellis Kinder and Mel Parnell to go with
journeyman Denny Galehouse (8-7). With the score 1-1 in the 4th, Ken Keltner
hits a 3-run HR over the LF fence. Player-manager Lou Boudreau gets 4 hits,
including a pair of homers, and finishes the year with just 9 strikeouts,
the lowest number since 1922.

The Cubs send Bill Nicholson to the Phillies for former NL batting champ
Harry Walker. The Inquirer predicts this is a forerunner of further trades
with the Cubs.

The Yankees fire Bucky Harris as manager, announcing that the new manager
will be named later. Several men are being considered, "not including a
player active with the 1948 team." Minor league manager Jim Turner's name
is mentioned as a possibility.

In St. Louis, Taylor Spink, publisher of The Sporting News writes in a
Baltimore newspaper that Baltimore will have an AL team within two years. "You
can put a clothespin in this:  Baltimore will be in the American League,
if not next year, then surely in 1950."

1950
Relief ace Jim Konstanty of the Phils starts and loses to Vic Raschi and
the Yankees in Philadelphia, 1-0, in game 1 of the WS. Bobby Brown doubles
and comes around on 2 long flies to score the lone run.

The Columbus Clippers (AA) win the Little World Series 4 games to 1 with
a 6-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles (IL).

1951
In the opening game of the World Series, Monte Irvin steals home in the
first inning and collects 4 hits. The Giants defeat Allie Reynolds and the
Yankees, 5-1, with Dave Koslo going all the way at Yankee Stadium. With
the injured Mueller missing the World Series, Bobby Thomson switches the
3B and the Giants field the first black outfield of Thompson, Irvin and
Mays. Irvin is the first player to steal home in a World Series contest
since 1928. Twenty-three years ago, Bob Meusel of the Yankees swiped the
dish in a 7-3 victory over the Cardinals in the sixth inning of game 3.

1952
The Yankees draw even at home, 2-0, behind the shutout pitching of Allie
Reynolds. Johnny Mize, inserted at 1B, clubs a HR, a single, a double,
and walks in 4 at-bats.

In the famed Little World Series, the Rochester Red Wings (IL) defeat the
Kansas City Blues (AA), 4-3.

1953
In an eventual 11-7 victory in game 5, Mickey Mantle sends a Russ Meyer pitch
into the upper deck to become only the fourth player in World Series history
to hit a grand slam. The Yankees' slugger joins teammate Gil McDougald
(1951), Ellmer Smith (1920) and Tony Lazzeri (1936) in accomplishing the
feat. Today's game features 25 hits and 47 total bases.

1955
After more than half a century of futility, the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers
finally win a World Championship thanks to Johnny Podres' 2-0 shutout of
the Yankees and an outstanding catch by Sandy Amoros.

1956
Rain delays game 2 of the WS.

1958
Yankee pitchers Don Larsen and Ryne Duren combine for a shutout as New York
wins, 4-0. Yankee OF Hank Bauer accounts for all 4 runs, including a 2-run
homer in the 7th. With his 3 for 4 performance, Bauer establishes a major
league record by collecting at least one hit in 17 consecutive World Series
games. The Yankee outfielder sets the mark playing in three straight Fall
Classics from 1956 to 1958.

A Tokyo schoolboy star named Sadaharu Oh is signed by the Yomiuri Giants
for a bonus of Y13,000,000 (about $55,000). Oh will become one of the most
famous players in baseball, setting many world hitting records.

The Sporting News names Washington OF Albie Pearson and Yankee P Ryne
Duren as its AL Rookies of the Year; the Giants 1B Orlando Cepeda and P
Carl Willey of the Braves as its NL Rookies of the Year.

1959
Stating he wants to spend more time with his family, Fred Haney resigns
as Braves manager and will be replaced by Charlie Dressen. During his
three-and-a-half year tenure in the Milwaukee dugout, the 64-year-old
embattled skipper compiled a 341-231 (.596) record, resulting in two
second-place finishes, two pennants and a World Championship.

In Los Angeles, the Dodgers win, 3-1, behind the pitching of Don Drysdale
and Larry Sherry. Carl Furillo's pinch 2-run single in the 7th is the
difference. The 92,394 in attendance sets a new WS mark.

The Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, next to Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo,
is dedicated.

1961
Whitey Ford's 3rd straight WS shutout, with HRs by Elston Howard and Bill
Skowron, gives New York a 2-0 win in the opener against Cincinnati at
Yankee Stadium.

1962
At Candlestick Park, in game one of the WS, Roger Maris stakes Whitey
Ford to a 2-run lead with a first-inning 2-run double. Only RF Felipe
Alou's leaping effort keeps Maris' drive in the park. Whitey Ford's record
consecutive-shutout-inning streak ends at 33 2/3 innings when a surprise
bunt by Jose Pagan brings Willie Mays home. Clete Boyer's 7th-inning HR
gives the Yankees a 6-2 win, the last of a record 10 WS victories for Ford.

1964
Thirty minutes after their 9-2 loss to Chicago on the last day of the
season, the Giants fire manager Alvin Dark, and then name Herman Franks, a
coach on the team, to be his successor. The former controversial skipper,
rumored to be on the chopping block before the start of the season,
is quoted complaining about the number of black and Hispanic players on
his team in a Newsday article printed in August, telling Stan Issacs,
"they are just not able to perform up to the white player when it comes to
mental alertness". The Giants finish in 4th places 3 games off the pace. In
today's game, Larry Jackson gets the victory for his 24th win for the Cubs,
the most ever for an 8th-place team. He also sets a ML record for pitchers
by fielding 109 chances during the season without an error. Walter Johnson
fielded 103 chances without an error in 1913.

The Phils bomb the Reds, 10-0, as both teams finish one game behind
St. Louis. The 2 teams then sit in the visitor's clubhouse and hope that
New York's Galen Cisco (6-18) can stop the Cards. The Mets take a 3-2 lead
into the 5th inning, but St. Louis scores 3 runs to regain the lead. The
Mets score once more but the Cardinals complete their scoring with 3 in the
8th to win 11-5. Bob Gibson wins in relief. For St. Louis, it is their 1st
pennant since 1946.

1965
Dick Sisler is released as manager of the Reds.

Boston trades P Bill Monbouquette to Detroit for OF George Thomas and IF
George Smith.

1967
Cardinals LF Lou Brock has 4 hits, 2 stolen bases and scores twice, as
St. Louis edges Boston, 2-1, to open the World Series at Fenway Park. Bob
Gibson has 10 strikeouts and outduels Jose Santiago, whose HR is Boston's
only score.

1969
In the first ever League Championship Series playoff game, the Mets beat the
Braves, 9-5, in Atlanta. New York survives HRs by Hank Aaron and Tony Gonzalez
off Tom Seaver and scores 5 runs off Phil Niekro in the 8th to coast home.

The Orioles defeat Minnesota in game 2 of the ALCS, 1-0, with the game's lone
run coming from a Mark Belanger single, two ground outs and a bunt single by
Paul Blair in the bottom of the 11th inning at Memorial Stadium. Dave McNally
goes the distance in the longest complete-game shutout in post season history.

1970
ML umpires return after a one-day walkout in quest of higher wages. Minor
League umps had been pressed into service for the opening LCS games the day
before. There had been rumors of a strike for several days as negotiations
between the umpires and ML baseball had reached an impasse.

Bobby Tolan leads the Reds to a 3-1 win as Cincinnati continues to roll
over the Pirates in the NLCS. Tolan tallies 3 hits, including a HR, and
scores all 3 of his team's runs.

Dave McNally hurls Baltimore to a 2-0 ALCS lead as the Orioles blast the
Twins, 11-3. Harmon Killebrew and Tony Oliva hit homeruns in a losing cause.

1971
Baltimore wins its 2nd straight game in the ALCS, beating Oakland, 5-1,
on HRs by Boog Powell (2), Brooks Robinson and Ellie Hendricks. Four of
Baltimore's 7 hits against Catfish Hunter are homers.

1972
At Montreal's Parc Jarry, the Mets end the 1972 campaign beating the Expos,
3-1. Although New York finishes ten games over .500, they will become
the first club in baseball history to finish a season without any player
collecting 100 hits.

Ted Williams manages his final game as the Rangers lose to the Royals,
4-0. Williams will be replaced by Whitey Herzog. It is the last game for
Royals manager Bob Lemon and the last game played at KC's Municipal Stadium.

Milwaukee's Jim Lonborg completes a successful comeback year with his 14th
win, a 3-hit 1-0 victory over the 4th place Yankees.

Nolan Ryan fails in his quest to win 20 as the Angels fall to AL West winners
Oakland, 2-1. Ryan strikes out 10 to finish the year with 329 strikeouts,
4th on the all-time list behind Koufax, Waddell and Feller.

1975

Championship Series opener.

1977
The Phillies score twice in the 9th inning on singles by Bake McBride,

over the Phillies in the opener of the NLCS. Davey Lopes and Steve Yeager
also homer at the Vet.

Kansas City notches 16 hits off 3 Yankee pitchers to even the AL series
with a 10-4 win. Freddie Patek's surprise homer in the 6th with a man on
seals the victory.

1979
Baltimore takes a 9-1 lead in the LCS game, but the Angels score 7 runs in
the last 4 innings only to fall short, 9-8. Eddie Murray drives in 4 runs
for the Orioles.

1980
Mike Schmidt's 2-run homerun in the top of the 11th inning gives Philadelphia
a 6-4 win over Montreal, clinching the NL East title for the Phillies. The
homerun is Schmidt's 48th of the season, breaking Eddie Mathews' single-season
record for 3B set in 1953.

The Yankees clinch their 4th AL East title in 5 seasons, beating Detroit, 5-2,
in the first game of a doubleheader. Reggie Jackson hits his 41st homerun of
the season and will share the AL homerun crown with Milwaukee's Ben Oglivie.

In a 17-1 rout of the Twins, Kansas City's Willie Wilson becomes the first
ML player ever to be credited with 700 at-bats in one season. Wilson will
post 705 at-bats, the highest this century. He also sets the AL record for
singles in a season with 184, eclipsing the mark Sam Rice set in 1925. Wilson
also becomes only the 2nd player in history to collect 100 hits from each
side of the plate, matching the feat accomplished by Garry Templeton in
1979. The loss ends Minnesota's club-record 12-game winning streak.

The Dodgers break a 1-1 tie on a 4th-inning HR from Steve Garvey to beat
the Astros, 2-1. Loser Nolan Ryan goes 11-10, while Jerry Reuss wins his
18th. Houston now leads by 1 game with 1 to play.

LaMarr Hoyt (9-3) of the White Sox stops California, 4-2, but the
big attraction is DH Minnie Minoso, 57 (or 54, according to his
autobiography). Facing Frank Tanana for the 2nd time in 5 years, Minnie
goes 0 for 2. Minoso's appearance, thanks to Bill Veeck, puts him with
Nick Altrock as a 5-decade man in the ML. His next appearance will be for
another Veeck team, St. Paul, in 1993.

Boston collects 22 hits but still loses to visiting Toronto, 7-6 in 17
innings. The Jays have 17 hits, including a game-tying 9th-inning 2-run HR
by Lloyd Moseby, off Bob Stanley. Stanley also gives up the game-winning
hit to Dane Iorg in the 17th.

1981
The Reds, who blank Atlanta, 3-0, finish with the best record in the
National League strike-shortened season (66-42), but will not participate
in the post-season. The team does not qualify because the Dodgers and
Astros post better records, respectively, for the first half (pre-strike)
and second half (post-strike) of play in the Western Division and will face
one another in the first-ever 'NLDS', under a plan instituted mid-season
by Giants executive Al Rosen to salvage the season.

With one game remaining in the season, the Mets fire manager Joe Torre and
his entire coaching staff. The team finishes 41-62.

The Reds' Mario Soto fires a one-hitter, beating the Braves, 3-0. The only
Atlanta hit is a 2nd-inning single by Chris Chambliss.

1983
In the NLCS opener, Mike Schmidt's first-inning homer and Al Holland's
clutch relief pitching to get out of an 8th-inning bases-loaded jam are
enough for Philadelphia to top Los Angeles, 1-0.

Having finished last in the NL West for the 2nd straight year, the Reds
drop manager Russ Nixon and replace him with Vern Rapp.

1984
The Padres take a lead in an NLCS game for the first time, and they go on
to down Chicago, 7-1.

1985
George Brett drives in 2 runs with a bases-loaded single and his 2nd
inside-the-park homer in 2 days as the Royals trip the A's, 4-2. The win
gives the Royals at least a tie for the AL West title.

1986
New York sweeps a doubleheader from Boston at Fenway Park, 5-3 and 3-1. Yankee
closer Dave Righetti saves both ends of the twin bill bringing his major
league record total to 46. Bruce Sutter and Dan Quisenberry had shared the
record with 45.

At the Metrodome, the Twins' Greg Gagne lines a 2nd-inning inside-the-park
homer off Chicago's Floyd Bannister. In his next at-bat, there are two
runners on when he repeats, again off Bannister, to tie the AL record.
The light-hitting Twins shortstop becomes just the 18th modern major leaguer
to accomplish this rare feat. Gagne almost sets a 20th-century record with
a third IPHR, but settles for a triple as the Twins win, 7-3.

Playing for the Indians, Forty-seven-year-old Phil Niekro "steals" the first
base of his career. With the Tribe at-bat in the 8th inning, behind 5-2
against Seattle, there is a runner on 1B when Niekro, wearing a red bandanna
over his face, lumbers out of the Cleveland dugout. He rambles towards 2B,
diving in headfirst, and ump Vic Voltaggio signals safe. To the delight of
the fans, "Knucks" rips the bag out of the ground and triumphantly returns
to the dugout with his first steal.

1987
Defeating the Blue Jays, 1-0, the Tigers win the American League East
title. Toronto loses their last seven games of the season, including three
straight in the season-ending series at Tiger Stadium to complete one of the
greatest collapses in baseball history. The Tigers were one game behind the
Blue Jays entering their 3-game season-ending showdown, and won each game
by a single run (4-3, 3-2 and 1-0). Frank Tanana outduels Jimmy Key in the
finale, and Larry Herndon's 2nd-inning homerun provides the game's only run.

On the last day of the season at Arlington Stadium, Charlie Hough and the
Rangers lose to the Mariners, 7-4. The Texas knuckleballer is the last
pitcher to start 40 games in a season.

Boston's Roger Clemens closes out his season with a 2-hit 12-strikeout 4-0
win over the Brewers, improving his record to 20-9. Chris Bosio is the loser.

1988
Dwight Gooden and Orel Hershiser start but neither get the decision. New
York rallies for three 9th-inning runs to win the opening NLCS game over
the Dodgers, 3-2.

After a three-year run, the Pirates fire GM Syd Thrift.

1989
Will Clark goes 4 for 4 with 2 homeruns, including the first NLCS grand
slam since 1977, to lead the Giants to a 11-3 win over the Cubs in game
one of the NL playoffs. Clark's 6 RBIs tie Bobby Richardson's single-game
post-season record set in the 1960 World Series.

Rickey Henderson swipes 4 bases as Oakland beats Toronto again, 6-3.

1990
Trailing 3-0 after one inning, the Pirates come from behind to beat the Reds,
4-3, in game 1 of the NLCS.

1991
Trailing 3-2 in the 9th, Cleveland's Jim Thome hits a two-out two-run homer,
his first in the majors, to give the Tribe the lead over the Yankees. Steve
Olin pitches the 9th to save the win for reliever Eric Bell. With four wins
over the past month, Bell (4-0) ends the year with the most wins for an
undefeated pitcher on a team losing a hundred games (as noted by Greg Crouse).

1992
In the season finale, the Dodgers are beaten by the Astros, 3-0, to finish
the season with a 63-99 record. It is the first time since 1905 the team
has finished in last place.

Juan Gonzalez has 3 hits, including his AL-high 43rd homer, one better than
McGwire, to pace the Rangers to 9-5 win over California. Dean Palmer also
homers, both coming off Bert Blyleven, to help Kevin Brown win his 21st. At
22 years 11 months 19 days, Gonzalez becomes the youngest homerun champion
in baseball history. 'Juan Gone' is 46 days younger than Joe DiMaggio,
who won the crown playing with the Yankees in 1937.

Greg Litton, hitting in the 13th for Dave Righetti, hits a pinch grand slam
to give the Giants a 6-2 win over the visiting Reds. It is the latest pinch
slam in ML history.

The Pirates top the Mets, 2-0, behind rookie Tim Wakefield (8-1).

After three straight winning seasons, Terry Collins is fired as manager of
the Astros. He is replaced by broadcaster Larry Dierker.

U.S. District Judge Edmund W. Ludwig prevents the umpires from striking
the playoff games in protest of the Alomar incident, citing the no-strike
clause in their contract.

Joe Hoerner, 59, dies. He was an All-Star reliever for seven teams and
averaged 15 saves for the 1966-69 Cardinals.

1997
A solid pitching performance by Jeff Fassero keeps the Mariners alive in
their series with the Orioles, as Seattle wins by a score of 4-2.

New York's Mark Baldwin surrenders only 3 hits, but is outdueled by Ed
Stein, who pitches his 2nd one-hitter of the season to lead Brooklyn to a
3-0 victory.

In a one-game playoff for the NL wild card, the Mets beat the Reds at Cinergy
Field, 5-0. Southpaw Al Leiter goes the distance limiting Cincinnati to

victory. Andy Pettitte holds Oakland scoreless for 7 2/3 innings for the win.

2001
Barry Bonds ties Mark McGwire's single-season homerun record established
three years ago as he hits his 70th round-tripper. The historic homer,
a shot to right-center at Enron Field, is given up in the ninth inning by
Astro rookie hurler Wilfredo Rodriguez in a Giant 10-2 victory.

With his third inning homerun, 42-year-old Rickey Henderson breaks Ty
Cobb's record to become the leading run-scorer in baseball history. To
punctuate scoring his 2,246th run, the Padre outfielder slides into home.
The Padres defeat the Dodgers, 6-3.

In a 16-1 loss to Seattle, 26-year-old Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez hits
his 52nd homerun becoming only the fourth major leaguer to hit 50 homeruns
and 200 hits in the same season. Hall of Famers Babe Ruth (1921), Hack Wilson
(1930) and Jimmie Foxx (1932) are the other players to accomplish the feat.

Tim Raines Jr plays center field and Tim Raines Sr plays left field in the
Orioles' 5-4 loss to Boston. They become the 2nd father-son duo to play in
the same game, matching the feat turned by Ken Griffey Sr and Ken Griffey Jr
with the Mariners in 1990. The Orioles acquired the senior Raines yesterday
from the Expos.

2002
Commissioner Bud Selig apologizes to St. Louis fans for the late playoff
start time for the Cardinal and Diamondback game 1 NLDS game and promises
it will not happen again. The 10 p.m. CDT start was due to many of the
playoff teams coming from the west and baseball's desire not to have two
games being played at the same time.

The Yankees blow a 6-1 lead as the Angels bounce back for a 9-6 victory and
a 2 games to 1 lead in their division series. Tim Salmon and Adam Kennedy
homer for Anaheim and Francisco Rodriguez again gets the win in relief.

to give Oakland a 2 games to 1 lead in their division series. Ray Durham
hits an inside-the-park homer to open the game and Scott Hatteberg follows

Oakland. The A's are the first team in postseason history to hit consecutive
homeruns to start a game.

2003

on to the NLCS. The game ends in bang-bang fashion as Jeff Conine throws
out JT Snow at home plate as Snow tries to score the tying run.

The Athletics lose to the Red Sox, 3-1 in 11 innings, on Trot Nixon's walkoff
homer. The loss ties the series at 2 games apiece. The pinch-hit walk-off
homerun Nixon hit is the fifth such long ball in postseason history, and
the 1st in the pinch since Kirk Gibson's famous homer off Dennis Eckersley
to win game 1 of the 1988 World Series.

The Yankees move into the lead in their series with the Twins with a 3-1
win behind Roger Clemens. The Rocket surrenders only 1 run and 5 hits in
7 innings. Hideki Matsui hits a HR for NY.

with 2 outs in the 9th.

2004
The Mariners fire Bob Melvin as their manager.

2005
Two-time National League Manager of the Year (1990 and 1992 Pirates) Jim
Leyland is named to replace Alan Trammell, who was fired as the Tigers'
manager yesterday. The sixty-year-old, who guided the Marlins to a World
Championship in 1997, has not managed since resigning as the Rockies skipper
in 1999.

With John Hart's resignation yesterday, the Rangers name his assistant
Jon Daniels to be the team's general manager. The 28-year-old, who is ten
months younger than BoSox boss Theo Epstein, becomes the youngest GM in
big league history.

The Yankees score 3 runs in the 1st inning on Robinson Cano's bases-loaded
triple, then hold on for a 4-2 victory over the Angels in the opening game
of their Division Series. Mike Mussina gets the win for NY, while Bengie
Molina homers in a losing cause for Los Angeles.

The White Sox pound out an ALDS-record 5 HRs, including a pair by
A.J. Pierczynski, to rout the Red Sox, 14-2, in the opener of the Division
Series. Paul Konerko, Juan Uribe and Scott Posednik also connect for Chicago,
while Jose Contreras gets the win.

The Cardinals down the Padres, 8-5, behind Chris Carpenter to take the
first game of their division Series. Reggie Sanders hits a grand slam for
St. Louis and sets an NLDS record with 6 RBIs. Jim Edmonds also homers for
the Cards and Eric Young connects for SD.

Tampa Bay hires 28-year-old Andrew Friedman as GM.

2006
Citing the need for a different kind of communicator in the dugout, Jon
Daniels, one year after he becomes the youngest GM in big league history,
fires veteran skipper Buck Showalter. The Ranger manager compiled a 319-329
record during his four-year tenure in Texas.

Russell Martin's double kills a promising two-on none-out rally as both
Dodger runners are nailed at home. Jeff Kent and J.D. Drew both try to score,
but the relay from right fielder Shawn Green to second baseman Jose Valentin
to Paul Lo Duca gives the catcher an opportunity to tag each runner during
their headfirst slides into the plate.

The Mets open their NL Division Series against the Dodgers with a 6-5
win. Carlos Delgado gets 4 hits, including a HR for New York, while
Cliff Floyd adds a homer and David Wright collects 3 RBIs with a pair of
doubles. Guillermo Mota gets the win in relief.

with a 5-2 victory. Mark Kotsay hits an inside-the-park HR for the victors.

2008
The Dodgers complete a three-game NLDS sweep of Chicago with a 3-1 victory,
winning their first postseason series since 1998. The stunning loss in the
playoffs extends the World Series drought for the Cubs into another century.

2009
On the last day of the campaign, Miguel Tejada hits a fourth-inning double
off Nelson Figueroa in the Astos' 4-0 loss in New York to finish the
season with 46, the most in the National League. The Astros' shortstop,
also tops in the AL with 50 two-baggers playing for the Orioles in 2005,
is the first player in baseball history to have led both leagues in doubles.

A. J. Burnett of the New York Yankees wins his 100th game.

Albert Pujols breaks Bill Buckner's 1985 major-league record for assists
by a first baseman, with his 185th.

2010
A day after the season ends, the last place Pirates fire John Russell, who
equaled a franchise record for most losses by a manager in three seasons
compiling an 186-299 record. The other Buc skipper with as many defeats in
the same time frame was Fred Haney, posting a 163-299 record from 1953-55.

The Mets fire manager Jerry Manuel and general manager Omar Minaya,
a day after the team completes its fourth consecutive disappointing
season. Assistant GM John Ricco will be the head of baseball operations
on an interim basis until a new GM is hired, who in turn will select the
team's next manager.

Major League Baseball approves a change in the grounds rules for Tropicana
Field making a batted ball that caroms off the A and B-ring catwalks a dead
ball with the pitch not counting, instead of being in play as in the past. The
Rays requested the change, which will be implemented in the upcoming ALDS,
after Jason Kubel's two-out ninth-inning pop up hit off one of the catwalks
driving in the go-ahead run in Minnesota's eventual 8-6 victory over the
home team.

On a day three managers are sacked, the Reds give their skipper, Dusty Baker,
a two-year contract extension through 2014. Cincinnati is making its first
playoff appearance in 15 years.

The Indians name Chris Antonetti as the team's new general manager, with
former GM Mark Shapiro moving into his new position as team president. The
transition has been developing over the past few years with Antonetti
gradually being given a bigger role in Cleveland's day-to-day operations,
giving Shapiro more time to run the business side of the franchise.

Diamondbacks interim manager Kirk Gibson is given the permanent job, agreeing
to a two-year deal with a team option for 2013. The former hard-nosed major
leaguer compiled a 34-49 record for the last-place team, after being hired
midseason to replace A.J. Hinch.

2012
A day after the regular season comes to an end, the Red Sox fire Bobby
Valentine, just ten months into his tenure as their manager. In their worst
campaign since 1965, the team finishes in last place with a 69-93 record.

2014
It takes the Giants six-hours and 23-minutes to defeat Washington at
Nationals Park, 2-1, making Game 2 of the NLDS the longest contest in
postseason history. San Francisco scores the eventual winning run in the
top of the 18th thanks to Brandon Belt's solo homerun off Tanner Roark,
hours after the team had sent the game into extra innings by scoring the
tying run with two outs in the top of the ninth.

2015
In an effort to add more drama to the final day of the regular season, MLB
schedules all games to start simultaneously at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The
scheduling, similar to the English Premier League's "Survival Sunday",
also evens the playing field by limiting teams' ability to rest potential
playoff starters based on the results of contests played earlier in the day.
