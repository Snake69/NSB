1908
Four days after the finish of the World Series, the two teams meet again
in Chicago for an exhibition game (as noted by historian Al Kermisch). The
game outdraws the last series game in Detroit, as 6,864 watch the Tigers
win, 7-2. In a pre-game field day, Ty Cobb wins all three sprint events:
he bunts and runs to 1B in 3.2 seconds, beating Evers, Mordecai Brown and
Del Howard. He circles the bases in 13.8 seconds and, clad in uniform,
wins the 100-yard dash in 10.4 seconds, beating Jones and Solly Hofman in
the latter. Hofman wins the long throw with a toss of 338 feet, besting
Sam Crawford.

1910
Jack Coombs struggles for a 9-3 win, walking 9 and giving up 8 hits, but
strands 14 Cubs, while a 6-run 7th off Three Finger Brown blows open the
win for the A's. Eddie Collins has 2 doubles and 2 SBs.

The Reds beat Cleveland, 8-5, in the 7th game of the first Ohio championship
series.

1912
In the rubber match of the 7-game Windy City series, the White Sox score 3
runs in the 1st two innings and all their runs in the 1st 5 innings to win,
16-0. The game was so bad that Cubs manager Chance left after 5 innings. The
Sox tied the first 2 games, then lost the next three games of the series. Ed
Walsh shuts out the Cubs, allowing no hits after the 5th and pitching 42
innings against the Cubs in 10 days. Sox catcher Ray Schalk later tells
Lloyd Lewis this was the greatest game he ever caught.

1913
In Cincinnati, the Giants and White Sox begin a five-month world-wide
barnstorming trip that will include stops in Australia, Asia, Europe and
the Middle East. The teams recruit top players from both leagues, including
Tris Speaker, Buck Weaver, Christy Mathewson as well as Sam Crawford,
but former Olympian Jim Thorpe is the main attraction during the global tour.

1914
NL and AL all-star teams, featuring stars such as Grover Alexander,
Jeff Tesreau, Joe Bush and Bill James, start an exhibition tour today in
Milwaukee with the Braves' Bill James losing to Bullet Joe Bush, 6-2. The
tour will take them to Hawaii after wandering throughout the West, with
the NL winning 29 of the 50 games played. Playing tomorrow in Mandan, ND,
the NL will win, 2-1 in 12 innings.

1920
NL directors meet in New York joined by Jacob Ruppert, Cap Huston, Charles
Comiskey and Harry Frazee of the AL. They name a committee to draw up an
agreement along the lines of Albert Lasker's proposal, and give the 5 AL
clubs still backing Ban Johnson an ultimatum:  come in by November 1st or the
Yankees, White Sox and Red Sox will pull out of the AL and join a 12-team NL
(with a team in Detroit to complete the roster). The AL 5 turns it down,
and bluff and counterbluff blow through the autumn air.

1922
The Tigers trade pitchers Carl Holling and Howard Ehmke, along with infielder
Danny Clark, outfielder Babe Herman and $25,000 to Boston for 2B Del Pratt
and P Rip Collins. Pratt has 2 more .300 seasons left; Collins and Ehmke
provide long-term benefits to their clubs. Herman, 19, won't make it to
the big leagues until 1926, and then it will be with Brooklyn.

1925
The Reds pitcher Marvin Goodwin dies in a plane crash in Houston. The
34-year-old appeared in four games for Cincinnati, three as a starter,
and posted an 0-2 record which included two complete games.

Salt Lake City (PCL) 2B Tony Lazzeri hits his 60th HR of the season in
a 12-10 victory over Sacramento in the final game of the year. It is an
inside-the-park drive in the 7th off Frank Shellenback. Lazzeri's PCL record
was accomplished in 197 games.

1950
Connie Mack retires after an amazing 50 years as the manager of the
Philadelphia Athletics. The winningest manager (most defeats, also) in
major league history will be replaced by Jimmy Dykes. Mack maintains his
position as president of the club.

1953
The Orioles agree to pay the International League $48,749 for its territorial
rights in Baltimore.

The Giants leave on a one-month tour of Japan, Korea and the Philippines.

1955
Homerun slugger and future Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner calls it quits. Kiner
hit just 18 homers for the Indians in 1955.

1956
The Brooklyn Dodgers begin an exhibition tour of Japan.

1960
Five days after losing to the Pirates in game 7 of the World Series,
instituting a mandatory retirement age of 65, New York Yankee co-owners Dan
Topping and Del Webb relieve Casey Stengel (1,149-696) as manager. Stengel:
"I wasn't retired - they fired me." A few days later, the 'Old Professor'
quips, "I'll never make the mistake of being seventy again". Stengel would
return to managing in 1962, when he becomes the first-ever manager of the
New York Mets.

1961
The Houston Colt 45s purchase P Hal Woodeshick from the Tigers.

1967
City officials from Kansas City, Oakland and Seattle were invited by
Joe Cronin to discuss the A's relocation plans. United States Senator
Stuart Symington attended the meeting and discussed the possibility of
revoking baseball's antitrust exemption if the A's were allowed to leave
Kansas City. The owners began deliberation and after the first ballot,
only six owners were in favor of relocation. The owner of Baltimore voted
against, while the ownership for Cleveland, New York and Washington had
abstained. In the second ballot, the New York Yankees voted in favor of
the Athletics relocation to Oakland. To appease all interested parties,
the Athletics announced that MLB would expand to Kansas City and Seattle no
later than the 1971 MLB season. MLB owners, bowing to Symington's threat,
awarded Kansas City and Seattle expansion American League franchises for
the 1969 season. (Ironically, Seattle would lose its expansion club,
the Pilots, after its lone campaign in the Pacific Northwest when the
team was declared bankrupt and awarded to Milwaukee automobile dealer Bud
Selig, who immediately moved the franchise to Milwaukee and renamed it the
Brewers. Selig later became Commissioner of Baseball in 1998.)

1970
Sachio Kinugasa takes his place in the starting lineup of the Hiroshima Carp,
playing 3B. Over the next 17 years he will play in 2,215 consecutive games -
the durability record of professional baseball, topping Lou Gehrig's 2,130.

1971
Dick Williams is named the Associated Press American League Manager of
the Year after guiding the A's to their first playoff appearance since the
franchise faced St. Louis in the 1931 Fall Classic. The 42-year-old skipper
also copped the honor for piloting the Red Sox during the team's Impossible
Dream season in 1967.

1972
With the rainout yesterday, game 5 is quickly re-scheduled for this
afternoon. With runners on second and third base in game 3 of the World
Series, Johnny Bench strikes out looking with a full count when is he
fooled by a trick play. The Cincinnati slugger believes he is going to
be given an intentional walk after the A's manager visits the mound and
catcher Gene Tenance returns to the plate signaling for a wide ball 4,
but the A's backstop quickly crouches behind home to catch a called strike
three from Rollie Fingers. Blue Moon Odom strikes out 11, but Cincinnati's
Jack Billingham is the winner, 1-0.

1973
The Mets win the 5th game, 2-0, behind the 3-hit pitching of Jerry Koosman
and Tug McGraw. Cleon Jones doubles in a run in the second and Don Hahn's
triple scores the other run.

1977
Reggie Jackson hits three homeruns on three consecutive pitches propelling
the Yankees to their twenty-first World Championship, 8-4. 'Mr. October'
also hit a homer in his last at-bat in the previous game.

1980
Willie Aikens slugs 2 more homeruns to lead the Royals to a 5-3 win and
even the World Series at 2-2.

1986
Boston wins game one of the World Series, 1-0, when Tim Teufel botches
Rich Gedman's routine grounder in the 7th inning, allowing Jim Rice to
score the game's only run. Bruce Hurst and Calvin Schiraldi combine on a
4-hitter for the Red Sox.

1987
The Twins win their 2nd straight WS game, 8-4, tallying 7 runs in the 4th
inning. Bush's bases-loaded double is the inning's big blow to back Bert
Blyleven's 7 innings of solid pitching.

1988
At Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Mark McGwire's homerun off Jay Howell
in the bottom of the 9th gives Oakland a 2-1 win in game 3 of the World
Series. With Kirk Gibson's heroics in game 1, "Big Mac's" walk-off homerun
marks the first time that two game-winning round-trippers are hit in the
same Fall Classic.

1991
The managerial merry-go-round continues as Jim Essian is fired as manager of
the Chicago Cubs. Managers axed to leave this year include Nick Leyva, Frank
Robinson, John Wathan, Buck Rodgers, John McNamara, Don Zimmer, Doug Rader,
Bud Harrelson, Jim Essian, Tom Trebelhorn, Joe Morgan (from Massachusetts),
Stump Merrill and Jim Lefebvre.

1992
The Canadian flag is inadvertently flown up-side down by a United States
Marine Corps color guard at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium during the
pregame ceremonies before game 2 of the World Series between the Blue
Jays and Braves. Although the international incident annoys the northern
neighbors of the U.S., most Toronto fans resist the call to fly the American
Stripes and Stars in a similar fashion during game 3 at the Skydome, but
opt instead to wave Canada's L'Unifolie with the message, "This end up",
affixed to the top. The Blue Jays even the WS with a 5-4 win over the
Braves. Pinch-hitter Ed Sprague's 2-run HR in the top of the 9th proves to
be the margin of victory, marking just the 2nd time in WS history that a
9th-inning HR turns a losing margin into a winning one. The other was Kirk
Gibson's homer in the 1988 Series.

1994
The Boston Red Sox name Kevin Kennedy, fired last week by Texas as their
new manager.

1997
Florida take game 1 of the WS, 7-4, behind rookie P Livan Hernandez. Moises
Alou's 3-run homer in the 4th inning is the big blow for the Marlins,
who are outhit by the Indians, 11-7.

1998
New York strikes early, scoring 3 runs in each of the 1st 2 innings. They
go on to cruise to a 9-3 win in game 2 behind Orlando Hernandez. Bernie
Williams and Jorge Posada connect for homers.

1999
The Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 6-1, to win the ALCS and their 36th AL
pennant. Orlando Hernandez wins the clincher for NY, and is named MVP of
the LCS. Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada homer for the Yanks.

2001
Larry Dierker, who left the Astros' broadcast booth to take over the dugout
duties as the team's skipper in 1997, resigns as Houston manager (448-362,
.553, four divisional titles) despite tying the Cardinals for the best
record in the National League (93-69) and winning the Central Division. The
team failed to win a playoff series in his five-year tenure going 2-12 in
postseason action.

New York wins its 2nd straight game in Seattle, 3-2, to take a 2-game-to-0
lead in the ALCS. Mike Mussina gets the victory and 3B Scott Brosius drives
in 2 runs for the Yankees.

2003
The Marlins surprise the Yankees with a 3-2 victory in the opening game of
the World Series. Juan Pierre has a 2-run single for Florida as Brad Penny
defeats David Wells.

2004
After 5 hours 49 minutes and 471 pitches, the Red Sox outlast the Yankees,
5-4, in game 5 of the league championship. Boston's DH David Ortiz, who is
the first player in baseball history to hit two walk-off homeruns during the
postseason, ends the longest game in ALCS series history at 1:22 a.m. with
a two-out single into center scoring Johnny Damon from second in the 14th
inning at Fenway Park. Ortiz also homers, as does Bernie Williams for NY.

The Astros win their 3rd in a row, shutting out St. Louis, 3-0, on Jeff
Kent's 9th-inning walkoff HR. The Cardinals manage only 1 hit off Brandon
Backe (8 innings) and Brad Lidge (1 inning) - Tony Womack's single in the 6th.

2006
The Mets edge the Cardinals, 4-2, to even the NLCS at 3 games apiece. Jose
Reyes gets 3 hits for the Mets, including a HR, and John Maine gets the win.

2008
Scoring in each of the last three innings, the Red Sox erase a seven-run
deficit in the seventh to beat the Rays, 8-7, in game 5 of the ALCS. The
Philadelphia A's, who rallied after trailing 8-0 to beat the Cubs, 10-8,
in game 4 of the 1929 World Series, is the only team to have made a bigger
comeback in the postseason.

2010
The Mariners hire Eric Wedge to be the team's new manager, its seventh skipper
since 2003. The former Cleveland field boss, out of baseball last season
after spending seven seasons in the Tribe's dugout, replaces Daren Brown who
had filled in on an interim basis for Don Wakamatsu, who was fired in August.

The Cardinals announce the signing of its long-time manager, keeping Tony La
Russa in the Redbirds' dugout for at least one more season, the skipper's
sixteenth with the club. The franchise has won eight division titles, two
National League pennants and a World Championship under the 66-year-old pilot,
but this year's team, heavily favored to win its division, collapsed during
the final two months of the season, finishing five games behind Cincinnati.
