native still out-points the White Sox starter, 64-58.

The Philadelphia Phillies trade third baseman Don Money and 2 others to the
Milwaukee Brewers in a deal that nets the Phils four pitchers including Jim

For the first time since Philadelphia A's Mule Haas hit a game-tying two-run
homer in game 5 of the 1929 World Series, a team comes from behind to tie a
Fall Classic game in the ninth and goes on to win in extra innings. Tino
Martinez sends the game into overtime with a two-out 2-run homer off
Diamondbacks closer Byung-Hyun Kim and Derek Jeter, dubbed Mr. November,
wins it after the stroke of midnight with a 10th-inning full-count two-out
round tripper (also off Kim) giving the Bronx Bombers a 3-2 victory and
knots the series at two games apiece. Mariano Rivera gets the win in relief
for the Yankees.

2005
Although offered approximately $4.5 million for a three-year extension,
four times the amount of his previous salary, Theo Epstein decides to
leave the BoSox after being the youngest general manager to lead a team to
a World Championship. The split with team president Larry Lucchino, who
hired the 18-year-old Yale undergraduate as an Oriole intern, gave him a
position with the Padres before bringing the 'Boy Wonder' to Boston, takes
the Red Sox Nation by surprise. On Halloween night, Epstein, on the night
of his resignation, eludes the media parked outside Fenway Park disguised
in a gorilla suit. At a future charity event, the hairy costume will be
auctioned and will make $11,000 for the Jimmy Fund and Theo's Foundation,
To Be Named Later.

2006
Joining Don Mattingly (Yankees, 1987), Cal Ripken Jr (Orioles, 1991), Frank
Thomas (White Sox, 1995), Jeff Bagwell (Astros, 1995) and Manny Ramirez
(Red Sox, 2002), Cardinal first baseman Albert Pujols becomes the sixth
player to get a perfect score (100) in the annual player rankings. The
Elias Sports Bureau rating, which was created as part of the settlement
of the 1981 strike to determine compensation for the loss of a free agent,
takes into account a player's plate appearances, batting average, on-base
percentage, homeruns and RBIs compared to others playing the same position
during the two past seasons.

The Astros announce the club will not exercise their option on first baseman
Jeff Bagwell for the 2007 season. 'BagPipes' is the all-time franchise
leader in homeruns, RBIs and walks.

2008
The Mets waste no time in exercising their $12 million option on Carlos
Delgado. After a well-publicized slow start, which strained the relationship
with his then-manager Willie Randolph, the 36-year-old first baseman batted
.313, blasted 24 homers and drove in 70 runs during the last three months
of the season playing for new skipper Jerry Manuel.

2009
Alex Rodriguez' game-3 fly ball in the right-field corner of Citzens Bank
Park becomes the subject of the first instant replay call in World Series
history. The Yankees third baseman's hit, originally ruled a double, is
changed by the umpires to a homerun after the replay clearly shows the ball
going over the fence before striking a television camera and bouncing back
to the field.

2010
For the first time in major league history, two former presidents attend the
same World Series game when George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are both
at Rangers Ballpark for game 4 of the Fall Classic. Prior to the contest
against San Francisco, the elder Bush, a former first baseman at Yale,
stands close by when his son, the former controlling owner of the Texas
franchise, throws the ceremonial first pitch.

2011
The World Champion Cardinals announce that Tony La Russa, the team's manager
for the past 16 seasons, has decided to retire. The 67-year-old skipper,
who is only 35 games behind John McGraw on the all-time list for second
place for games won, compiled a 2,728-2,365 (.536) managerial record during
his 33 seasons with the White Sox, A's and St. Louis.

The Mets announce on their Twitter page that the team is planning to move
the left and right-field fences at Citi Field closer to home plate by as
much as 12 feet and to also lower the homerun line to eight feet. Since
moving into their new home in 2009, the Amazins have hit only 331 homeruns
at home, the least of any major league team.

2013
The Nationals name Diamondback coach Matt Williams as their sixth manager
in team history, replacing Davey Johnson, who previously announced his
retirement. The job will be the 47-year-old former All-Star third baseman's
first major league managerial stint.

2014
The Cubs dismissed manager Rick Renteria, who, according to GM Theo Epstein,
"deserved to come back for another season". The availability of Joe Maddon,
announced as the team's new skipper an hour after Renteria's dismissal,
puts an end to the first-year skipper's managerial career in Chicago.
