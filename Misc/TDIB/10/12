1902
At Chicago's South Side Grounds, the NL all-stars down the AL all-star squad,
7-3. Joss declines to start on the mound and plays LF instead. Donovan and
Mercer are the opposing hurlers.

1905
With 2 days rest, Mathewson allows his first and only walk in 27 innings,
in a 4-hit 9-0 romp at the Baker Bowl. The Giants cook Andy Coakley for 9
runs on 8 hits and 5 walks. The A's add 4 errors, 3 by 2B Danny Murphy. The
Giants now lead the WS, 2-1.

1906
It's Brown's turn to throw a 2-hit shutout, besting Altrock, 1-0, and evening
the Series. Frank Chance reaches base in the 7th on a Texas Leaguer that
drops in front of the late-breaking Hahn, and two (!) sacrifice bunts get
him to 3B. Johnny Evers then lines a single for the only run.

1907
At Detroit's Bennett Park, right-hander Mordecai 'Three Finger' Brown throws
a 2-0 shutout beating the Tigers to capture the World Championship for the
Cubs. Each side has 7 hits, but the Cubs steal 4 bases for a total of 18
for the 5-game World Series. Although game 1 ended in a 3-3 12-inning tie,
Chicago becomes the first club to sweep a Fall Classic.

In Boston, the AL Americans dominate their NL neighbors, just as they did
in their City Series in 1905. Today's match ends, 4-3, the Americans' 6th
win in 6 games. The final game will end in a 3-3 tie. The two teams won't
meet again in a City Series match until 1925.

1908
Tiger bats roar for the last time, as Jack Pfiester proves an easy target,
8-3. Ty Cobb is 4 for 5.

1909
George Mullin's 5-hit 5-0 victory evens the Series again, as Cobb drives
in 2 runs with a double. Mullin strikes out 10 batters, as Lefty Leifield
takes the loss. Lefty is not helped by 6 Buc errors.

1910
With the AL season ending a week earlier than the NL, the champion A's tune
up with a 5-game series against an AL all-star team, which includes Ty Cobb,
Tris Speaker, Doc White, Ed Walsh and Walter Johnson. The A's drop 4 out
of 5 to the all-stars, but Mack will later state, "Those games, more than
anything else, put the Athletics in a condition to outclass the National
League champions."

1911
The Reds edge the Cubs, 4-3, in the final game of the season. Bob Bescher
scores twice and steals three bases to give him 80 for the year, tops in
the NL. It is the 3rd of four years in a row that Bescher will lead in steals.

1912
In Boston for game 5, the Red Sox scratch only 2 runs off Mathewson on 5
hits, but 18-game winner Hugh Bedient holds the Giants to 3 hits. The 2-1
win gives Boston a 3-1 Series edge.

1913
John McGraw hosts a reunion for Hughey Jennings and the old Orioles. After a
night of heavy drinking, he blames his longtime friend, business partner,
and teammate Wilbert Robinson for too many coaching mistakes in the
Series. Robby replies that McGraw made more mistakes than anybody and McGraw
fires him. Eyewitnesses say Robby douses McGraw with a glass of beer and
leaves. They won't speak to each other for 17 years. Six days later Robby
will begin a legendary 18 years as manager, replacing Bill Dahlen. The team
will carry the nickname Robins, as well as Dodgers, during his tenure.

1914
Joe Bush, 17-10 for the A's, faces Lefty Tyler in game 3. Tied 2-2 in the
10th, Home Run Baker drives in his only 2 runs of the Series, but a HR by
Gowdy starts a game-tying rally. After James comes on and sets the A's down
for 2 innings, Gowdy doubles. Bush gives up a walk, then throws a sacrifice
bunt past Baker at 3B allowing pinch runner Les Mann to score the winning run.

1915
In game 4, 41,096 see another 2-1 Boston victory, as Ernie Shore gets the
win over surprise starter George Chalmers. Gavvy Cravath triples and scores
the Phils' lone run.

1916
Boston's 4-1 win in game 5 ends the Series. Right-hander Ernie Shore
three-hits the Dodgers at Braves Field. With the victory, Boston (AL) captures
its fourth World Championship in the 13-year history of the Fall Classic. The
Red Sox had 22 shares of $3,826. The Dodgers, less generous, $2,834. Red
Sox manager Bill "Rough" Carrigan, who announced late in the season that
he would be quitting, says good-bye to each of his players. Carrigan will
return to manage the Red Sox in 1927, but his teams will finish last for
three seasons. Jack Barry will take over as manager for the 1917 season.

1920
At Cleveland's League Park, Stan Coveleski wins his 3rd complete game of
the Series, and the Indians wrap it up, as Dodger bats are silent again.
The Tribe wins the best-of-nine series 5 games to 2. Burleigh Grimes is
nicked for single scores in the 4th, 5th and 7th, for a 3-0 loss. Utility
IF Jack Sheehan plays 3B for Brooklyn and gets his 2nd hit of the Series,
the same number of hits he had during the season. These 4 are his only ML
hits. Brooklyn manager Robinson, upset with Marquard's arrest, keeps Rube
on the bench ... the Dodgers have already made the decision to unload the
pitcher. Rube's wife, "Blossom Seeley" - her vaudeville name, comes to the
same conclusion and files for divorce next week.

1921
Carl Mays and Phil Douglas meet again, and again Mays has perfect control
(he gives up no walks in 26 innings). He yields 6 hits, but a 7th-inning
error by Aaron Ward at 2B, followed by Snyder's double, break a 1-1 tie
and give Douglas his 2nd win.

1923
In front of the largest crowd in baseball history, 62,430 fans are on
hand to see Casey Stengel hit his second homerun of the World Series. The
round-tripper proves to be the difference when Giants hurler Art Nerf (13-10)
outduels Yankees starter Sam Jones (21-8) in game 3 of the Fall Classic, 1-0.

1925
Louisville manager Joe McCarthy (American Association) is named to manage
the Chicago Cubs.

In game 5, Stan Coveleski goes out to finish off the Pirates, but a lapse
of control costs him 2 in the 3rd. Joe Harris' 3rd HR ties it in the 4th. In
the 7th, a walk and 3 hits net 2 runs and drive Coveleski off the mound. The
Pirates' 13-hit attack produces a 6-3 win.

1927
In the opening game of the Negro League WS, the Bacharach Giants' Luther
Farrell pitches a 3-2 no-hit win over the Chicago American Giants. The game
is played in a drizzle and shortened to 7 innings because of darkness.

1929
At 45, John Quinn (11-9) gets a start against Root. After giving up a HR to
Charlie Grimm with a man on in the 3rd, Quinn serves up 4 straight singles
to open the 6th, and in comes Rube Walberg (18-11). The inning ends with
the score 7-0. Trailing 8-0 in the 7th, the Athletics, in the greatest
rally in World Series history, shake Chicago by scoring 10 runs for a 10-8
victory. The most damaging play is Hack Wilson's misjudgment of a fly from
Mule Haas' bat, which goes for a 3-run inside-the-park HR.

1932
NY Yankees manager Joe McCarthy signs a 3-year contract.

1933
Jimmie Foxx (AL) and Carl Hubbell (NL) are named MVPs by the baseball writers.

1938
Durocher is named Dodger manager and adds Charlie Dressen and Bill Killifer
as coaches.

1948
The Yankees surprise its fans and a skeptical press when they name Casey
Stengel to replace Bucky Harris as the team's manager. In his previous
stints as the skipper with the National League's Braves and Dodgers, the
'Old Professor' had never finished higher than fifth place.

1954
Although a group comes forward to keep the team in Philadelphia, the American
League owners approve the sale of the A's to Arnold Johnson, a Chicago
business man, who will shift the team to Kansas City next season. The last
minute-deal to keep the franchise in the 'City of Brotherly Love' includes
Charlie O. Finley, who will eventually buy the team after it goes to KC,
moving it to Oakland in 1968.

1955
The Cardinals give manager Harry Walker his hat and replace him with Fred
Hutchinson. With the departure of Walker, who pinch hit for the Cards
during the season, the 1956 season will be the first one in NL history
without a player-manager. The AL first went to all bench managers in 1930,
then repeated in 1951.

1960
Whitey Ford preserves the Yankees' hopes with a 7-hit shutout at
Pittsburgh. Bob Friend is bombed again as New York coasts, 12-0. Bobby
Richardson's 2 run-scoring triples give him a WS record of 12 RBIs.

1961
Ralph Houk is given a 2-year contract extension to manage the Yankees.

The Texas League makes two franchise shifts, moving the Ardmore, OK team
to Albuquerque, NM and the Victoria, TX team to El Paso.

1963
In the first (and last) Hispanic American major league all-star game, the NL
team beats the AL 5-2 at the Polo Grounds. The game features such names as
Minnie Minoso, Tony Oliva, Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda, Julian Javier,
Felipe Alou, Luis Aparicio and Zoilo Versalles. Vic Power receives a pregame
award as the number-one Latin player. NL starter Juan Marichal strikes out
6 in 4 innings, though reliever Al McBean is the winner. Pinch hitter Manny
Mota drives in 2 against loser Pedro Ramos.

Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc. applies for an AL franchise to replace
the Braves.

1966
The White Sox send sore-armed Juan Pizarro to the Pirates for knuckleballer
Wilbur Wood, who spent the 1966 season with Columbus (International).

1967
Boston's Impossible Dream comes to an end when Cardinals ace Bob Gibson
throws a three-hitter, his third complete game in the Fall Classic,
beating the Red Sox, 7-2. The Cardinals earn their 2nd World Championship
of the decade. Gibson throws a 3-hitter with 10 strikeouts, and he hits a
5th-inning HR. The Red Sox' slogan for the season, based on the hit song
from the musical "Man of La Mancha" became popular as the ninth-place team
from last year won the AL flag on the last day of the campaign in a pennant
race involving four teams and came up one game short from being the World
Champions. Lou Brock becomes the third player in major league history to
accomplish a trio of thefts in a World Series contest. The three stolen
bases during the victory over Boston gives the speedy St. Louis left fielder
a total of seven for the series, establishing a new Fall Classic mark.

1969
Al Wies' timely ninth-inning hit (off loser Dave McNally) combined with the
two-hitter tossed by Jerry Koosman and Ron Taylor enable the Mets to even
the Fall Classic with the Orioles at one game apiece with a 2-1 win. New
York will win the next three games, all played at Shea Stadium, to finish
their amazing season with a World Championship.

1971
As the Series moves to Pittsburgh, Steve Blass 3-hits the Orioles, 5-1,
to give the Pirates their first win.

1972
In game 5 of the ALCS, the A's clinch their first American League pennant
since 1931 by beating Detroit at Tiger Stadium, 2-1. The A's Reggie Jackson
steals home, but pulls a hamstring in the process, sidelining him for
the WS. Oakland's Blue Moon Odom goes the first five innings, giving up
one run on two hits, and the ill starter is then replaced by Vida Blue,
who shuts down the opponents the rest of the way for a four-inning save.
Afterwards, Odom and Blue give new meaning to the term the Swingin' A's when
they begin to brawl in the clubhouse. Odom takes exception to the universal
choke sign made by Vida Blue, when the reliever used the gesture to answer
his own question, "How come you starters can't finish what you begin".

1974
Oakland slugging star Reggie Jackson connects for a homer off Andy Messersmith
to start the scoring, and pitcher Ken Holtzman scores the 2nd run in the
5th on a suicide squeeze. The A's win the WS opener, 3-2, as the Dodgers
strand 12 base runners.

Sadaharu Oh draws his 166th walk in a 130-game season, setting a Japanese
record. At his retirement in 1980, Oh will hold the all-time world record
for walks, 2,504, topping Babe Ruth's record of 2,056.

1975
Down 2-1 in the 9th inning, the Reds rally to win the WS 2nd game,
3-2. Concepcion's 2-out single off Dick Drago scores Bench with the tying
run, and Griffey's double wins it.

1976
The Reds score 7 times in the final 3 innings to secure a 7-6 win and complete
a sweep of the LCS. Jim Katt holds the Reds scoreless for 6 innings, leaving
with 2 on and no runs in. Johnny Bench and George Foster hit successive
HRs in the 9th off Ron Reed to start the rally.

In the AL game, Chris Chambliss contributes a HR and 3 RBIs to the Yankees
come-from-behind 5-3 victory. The Royals score 3 in the 1st off Dock Ellis,
but the former Pirate faces just 22 batters in the next 7 innings.

1977
HRs by Ron Cey, Steve Yeager, Reggie Smith and Steve Garvey lead the Dodgers
to a 6-1 win in game 2 of the WS. Burt Hooton goes the distance, allowing
just 5 hits.

1979
Kiko Garcia collects 4 hits and 4 RBIs to lead the Orioles to an 8-4 triumph
in game 3.

1980
The Phillies capture their first NL title since 1950 with a 10-inning 8-7
win over the Astros in the 5th and final game of the NLCS. Each of the last
4 games was decided in extra innings. The Phils, down by 3 runs to Nolan
Ryan in the 8th, rally, winning on Garry Maddox' double in the 10th.

1982
In game 1, Brewers leadoff batter Paul Molitor becomes the first player to
collect five hits in a World Series game. The third baseman's 5 for 6 Fall
Classic performance helps Milwaukee rout the Cardinals, 10-0, the biggest
shutout margin since the Yankees blanked the Bucs, 12-0, in 1960. Teammate
Robin Yount goes 4 for 6.

1983
At Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, the Orioles even the series at a game apiece
as they defeat the Phillies, 4-1. In a battle between rookie pitchers, Mike
Boddicker throws a three-hitter besting Charles Hudson as John Lowenstein
paces the Birds' offense with three hits, including a fifth inning homerun.

In game 2, Mike Boddicker pitches a 4-1 three-hitter to tie the Series 1-1. He
has yet to allow an earned run in 18 post-season innings, and is the first
rookie to pitch a 3-hitter in the World Series since Dickie Kerr in 1919.

1984
San Diego pitchers tie the WS record by issuing 11 walks in a 5-2 loss to
the Tigers in game 3. Detroit leads the Series 2-1.

1985
In game 4 of the ALCS, Al Oliver's 2-run pinch double in the 9th inning gives
Toronto a 3-1 win over Kansas City and a 3-1 lead in the series. Until this
year's best-of-7 format was adopted, the 3 wins would have sent the Blue
Jays to the World Series.

St. Louis runs the Dodgers out of Busch Stadium, 4-2. The Cardinals' first
3 runs are aided by 3 stolen bases and 2 errant pickoff attempts.

1986
One loss away from elimination and trailing, 5-2, entering the 9th, the
Red Sox stage one of the most improbable comebacks in post-season history
winning, 7-6, over the Angels in 11 innings. After Don Baylor's 9th-inning
homerun reduces the deficit to 5-4, reserve outfielder Dave Henderson
slugs a 2-out 2-strike 2-run homerun off Donnie Moore to give Boston a 6-5
lead. California ties the score with a run in the bottom of the 9th but
Henderson, who had appeared to be the goat when he dropped Bobby Grich's
long fly ball over the fence for a homerun in the 7th inning, delivers a
sacrifice fly in the 11th for the winning run.

Mike Scott baffles the Mets for a 2nd time, yielding only 3 hits in a 3-1
Astros victory. The Mets collect several balls thrown by Scott in an effort
to prove he was scuffing the ball, but the evidence is deemed inconclusive
and no action is taken against the Houston ace.

Norm Cash, 1961 AL batting champion, drowns in Lake Michigan, a victim of
a boating accident. He was 51.

ALCS. Ruben Sierra and Dave Winfield homer in the contest.

1993
Toronto captures the AL pennant with a 6-3 win in game 6 of the ALCS. Dave

Gant homers twice against his former teammates.

1997
The Indians again score the winning run in their last at-bat, coming back
from a 4-2 deficit to defeat the Orioles, 8-7, for their 3rd straight win in
the ALCS. Sandy Alomar drives home the winner with a single after hitting a
2-run homer earlier in the contest. He also scores from 2B on a wild pitch
in the 5th. Brady Anderson, Harold Baines and Rafael Palmeiro hit homers off
Jaret Wright in the 5th while Manny Ramirez goes deep for the Tribe. Jose
Mesa blows his 2nd save in 2 days, but receives credit for the win.

in game 5. Bobby Bonilla goes 3 for 3 for the Marlins.

Maddux gets the win for Atlanta, as C Eddie Perez hits a HR.

NLCS. Jay Payton drives home the winning run for NY, who wins in its last
at-bat for the 3rd time this postseason. Mike Piazza homers for the Mets.

2001
Tom Kelly retires as the Twins' skipper. During his 15-season tenure, the

deciding blow. Starter Miguel Batista gets the win for the Diamondbacks.

their NLCS 2 games to 1. Jim Edmonds, Eli Marerro and Mike Matheny clout
round-trippers for the Cards while Barry Bonds adds one for SF. Chuck Finley
gets the win for St. Louis.

The Angels take a commanding 3-games-to-1 lead over the Twins in the ALCS
with a 7-1 victory. Rookie John Lackey hurls 7 3-hit shutout innings for
Anaheim to get the win. Brad Fullmer and Benjie Molina each drive in a pair
of runs for the Angels.

2003
Thirty-five years after an anthem dispute, Jose Feliciano sings the
Star-Spangled Banner at the Marlins' NLCS game against the Cubs at Pro
Player Stadium. During game 5 of the 1968 World Series played in Detroit,
his nontraditional gospelized rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium caused
such flap that some radio stations stopped playing the blind singer's records
on the air. The Marlins stave off elimination with a 4-0 win over the Cubs
in the NLCS. Josh Beckett dominates Chicago with a 2-hitter, while Mike
Lowell, Ivan Rodriguez and Jeff Conine all homer for Florida.

With game 4 of the AL championship series postponed by rain, attention is
on Don Zimmer, who apologizes for yesterday's melee. "I'm embarrassed at
what happened," Zimmer said, fighting back tears. "I'm embarrassed for the
Yankees, the Red Sox, the fans, the umpires and my family." Zimmer is fined
$5,000 by Bob Watson, baseball's vice president in charge of discipline,
Martinez is fined $50,000, Ramirez $25,000 and Garcia $10,000. Boston owner
John Henry, pleased with Zimmer's apology, says he "wouldn't mind seeing
the same thing coming from our side." Red Sox first baseman Kevin Millar
says he hoped Zimmer's remarks would put an end to the "sideshow." Boston
center fielder Johnny Damon acknowledges that the Red Sox also were to blame
in the brawl. "If I was involved, I'd apologize. But then, Zimmer wasn't
coming after my life, he was coming after Pedro's." It is not Zimmer's last
press conference; he will announce after the Series that he is fed up with
Steinbrenner's interference and that he is retiring.

2004
The Yankees take the opening game of the ALCS with a 10-7 victory over
the Red Sox. NY almost blows an 8-0 lead, but holds on to win behind the
pitching of Mike Mussina and the hitting of Hideki Matsui (5 RBIs). Kenny
Lofton homers for the Yanks and Jason Varitek connects for Boston.

2005
The White Sox' 2-1 victory, that ties the ALCS at one-game apiece with the
Angels, will be best remembered for the Doug Eddings' controversial call
which appears to signal the third out of the ninth inning has been made,
but A.J. Pierzynski takes first base as the home plate ump belatedly rules
the catcher had trapped the swinging strike. The 'Pale Hose' will take
advantage of the incident when pinch runner Pablo Ozuna steals second and
scores the winning run on Joe Crede's double.

Interim manager Sam Perlozzo signs a 3-year contract to manage the Orioles.

2006
The Mets shut out the Cardinals, 2-0, in the 1st game of the NLCS. Carlos
Beltran's 2-run homer is the big blow for New York. Tom Glavine and a pair
or relief pitchers hold St. Louis to 4 hits.

2007
In a move commended by environmentalists, the Devil Rays, which had decided
to phase out all free parking, will still extend its offer to all vehicles
transporting four or more passengers. The decision exemplifies Tampa Bay's
continued approach to the greening of Tropicana Field and its team operations.

2009
The Phillies rally for three runs in the top of the ninth beating the Rockies,
5-4, in game 4 of the division series to advance to the NLCS. For the second
consecutive night at Coors Field, Huston Street, Colorado's very reliable
closer, gives up runs in the final frame and takes the loss.

The Cubs file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Wilmington,
Delaware. The anticipated short-term move will allow the club's owner, the
Tribune Company, to sell the team in an $845 million deal to the family of
TD Ameritrade Holding Corp's founder, Joe Ricketts.

2010
Behind the complete-game effort by Cliff Lee, the Rangers beat Tampa Bay,
5-1, in the decisive game 5 of the ALDS at Tropicana Field for the team's
first playoff series victory in franchise history, the last major league
club to accomplish the task. Texas, who will take on the Yankees for the
AL flag, lost their three previous playoff appearances with first-round
losses to the Bronx Bombers in 1996 and 1998-99.

2012
The Nationals, twice within a strike of reaching the NLCS, suffer the worst
collapse ever in a winner-take-all baseball postseason game when they are
stunned by the visiting Cardinals. After his team takes a 6-0 advantage in
the third inning and clings to a two-run lead with two outs in the ninth,
Washington's closer Drew Storen gives up four runs in the final frame,
resulting in the eventual devastating 9-5 loss at Nationals Park.

2013
For the first time in baseball history, two playoff games on the same day
end with the score of 1-0. In Game One of the ALCS, the Tigers blank Boston
at Fenway Park with the contest's lone run scoring on Jhonny Peralta's
sac fly in the sixth, and Jon Jay's fifth inning sacrifice fly at Busch
Stadium provides the only run the Cardinals will need to take a 2-0 game
advantage to Los Angeles in the NLCS.

Anibal Sanchez becomes the second person in postseason history to strike out
four batters in an inning when he whiffs Jacoby Ellsbury, Shane Victorino
(who gets on base on a passed ball), David Ortiz and Mike Napoli in the first
frame of Detroit's 1-0 ALCS victory over the Red Sox at Fenway Park. The
29-year-old right-hander, who matches Cubs right-hander Orval Overall's
total in Game 5 of the 1908 Fall Classic, is also the first Tiger hurler
to accomplish the feat in franchise history, including the regular season.

2015
The Chicago Cubs set a postseason record for most homeruns hit during a
game by hitting six against the St. Louis Cardinals.

There were a total of 21 homeruns hit which set a single-day postseason
record.
