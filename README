NSB v0.9.9.8
1 Apr 2023

NetStats Baseball (NSB) is a simulation of Major League Baseball.
NSB is a client/server application.

There are plenty of improvements to be made, and I know there are lots
of bugs to be fixed and adjustments to be made.

Network play is supported, however be advised that I'm certain there
are security faults present in the program.  Making NSB accessible over
a network currently is risky business.  Future releases of NSB will pay
more attention to security.

There *may* be a NSB server running at mlake.net

The text file "todo.txt" lists items to be done in future releases.

If anyone needs help, finds any bugs or has any comments, questions,
or suggestions for improvements feel free to send me an email at
<marshallelake@gmail.com>.  I'm open to _any_ feedback, good or bad.

See the text file "INSTALL" for installation instructions.

See the file "Notes2Users" for a few ..... notes to users.


Have fun.
