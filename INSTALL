NSB v0.9.9.6
15 Apr 2018

If you downloaded from github then from the NSB root directory (after
unzipping) you may just need to enter:
sudo make install

If gtknsbclient fails to execute (unable to find system libraries) then
from the NSB root directory do:
make clean
make
sudo make install


If you downloaded a tgz file (from sourceforge.net et al) do the following
after extracting the tgz file:
To make and install NSB, change directory to the NSB root directory,
enter the commands:
./configure
make
sudo make install


Whether you downloaded NSB from github or you downloaded the tgz file,
read the remainder of this INSTALL file and perform steps as needed.


Programs installed include:
nsbserver - the NSB server program
nsbpoolmngr - a controller for human versus human play over a network
gtknsbclient - a GTK client used to connect to the server program and
               play the game

After installation add the following two lines to the /etc/services file:
nsbpoolmngr  49998/tcp
nsbserver    49999/tcp

If upgrading from version 0.9.5 of NSB or older you will need to remove
the Records files in order to avoid any unspecified results since the
Records file format has changed since then.  The Records files exist in
the directories /var/NSB and /var/NSB/<user directory> and /var/NSB/<user
directory>/Lifetime

If upgrading from version 0.9.9 of NSB or older you will need to remove
old team files in order to avoid any unspecified results since the
player file format (comprising the team files) has changed since then.
Old team files exist in the directories /var/NSB/<user directory>/Lifetime
and /var/NSB/<user directory>/UserTeams

Enter the command "nsbserver &" to start the server in the background.
(See the man page for available options.)  The server must be started by a
user (more than likely the superuser) which has read and write permissions
in /var.  After starting the server enter the command "gtknsbclient
[ip-address-of-server]" to run the NSB client.  The default server to
which gtknsbclient will connect is localhost.  (Note - the nsbpoolmngr
program will be started by nsbserver.)

The first time you use gtknsbclient to connect to an nsbserver you
will be asked to input an NSB ID.  The NSB ID is simply a means for
the nsbserver program to which you are connected to identify you.
Most anything can be entered up to a maximum of 50 characters.

Much of gtknsbclient is self-explanatory.  See the man page for some
info.  There is also a HELP menu item available during the execution
of gtknsbclient.

All three programs (nsbserver, nsbpoolmngr and gtknsbclient) will be
installed into /usr/local/bin.  Also included in the installation are
all the various team statistic files for the years 1901 through 2017, and
short manuals for the three programs.  The stats files will be installed
into /var/NSB.  The manuals will be installed into /usr/local/man/man6.
Some additional files will be installed into /usr/local/share/NSB.
During play the server program will write into the stats area (/var/NSB/)
in order to keep track of the progress of the leagues for all the human
players.

It should be all right to install the executables into a different
location if you so desire but the statistic files need to go into
/var/NSB (specifically /var/NSB/RealLifeStats) since the calls to the
data are hardcoded in the NSB source code.  This will be changed in a
future release.

All the work has been done on an Intel Linux system.  If you get it
working on another platform let me know.
