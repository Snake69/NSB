sometimes pitchers (only starting pitchers ?) pitch too many innings
add option to nsbserver command line to disallow Waiting Pool
allow computer to choose starting position players randomly based upon percentage of games played at a position
when user deletes a UC team check if it is involved in a currently ongoing season & if so delete season (warn user first)
bug - established a totally random season, no PS, after season completed establishing a new season got msg "season is currently
  proceding" and trying to play portion of season got communication error
provide an option to nsbserver to kill any running processes
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6744979/kill-a-process-from-linux-application
  https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/c-program-to-kill-process-4175444948/
add option to display results Worst-2-Best in Evaluate Team Seasons
add ability to view lifetime real life category leaders
batting averages too low, ERA too high
it seems players with a low amount of stats (like closers) do not perform
  as they should
  try this:  add a factor to action logic so that real life stats are
    pro-rated equally ... based upon 500 PAs & 200 BFPs? ... or maybe bigger
    numbers like 1000 PAs & 500 BFPs? ... so, each player's stats would be
    factored up to the bigger numbers before determining action outcome
add NSB to repositories
  https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b4b094157d7a3be6afd2c96370d39fad
include a progress bar when playing portion of league (it appears the only way
  to do this is for the client to send commands to the server one at a time for
  each day/game in a loop so that the client gets control back after each day/game;
  but then the server algorithm would need to be changed)
    maybe display a box showing "Day xxx in schedule, Game: xxx" where xxx changes
      after each day and each game
add a "List U-C Teams" button to the Create Team dialog
add post-season game scores to Results files for NSB play
auto-play - allow ability to get post-season category leaders
allow user to see the NSB regular season schedule at any time, and game scores for games already played
any playoff games which are part of the regular season should be added dynamically
  to the schedule file and as such will be the next day/game on the schedule after
  the [standard] regular season ends (i.e., when the user plays the entire regular
  season there will still be playoff game(s) to play as part of the regular season);
  that means the standings should reflect that there are playoff game(s) to be played
  and regular season hasn't quite ended completely
double-check all season ending possibilities are handled properly (in one example, currently if 3 teams tie for 2 WC slots,
  team x plays team y & winner plays team z; it should be loser plays team z)
allow user to formulate queries (see queryplan.txt)

allow user to create a season comprised of:
  teams in results from running of Extras->Evaluate Team Seasons
  best teams of all time based upon regular season wins
change File->Connect to a Server so that it brings up a list of choices including:  localhost, 68.109.143.57
  allow user to add sites to this list
  add "NSB server available at 68.109.143.57 (no Waiting Pool)" to README.txt file
add inside the park homer
  usually a fast runner
  real life, 1951-2000 - 1 in 158 HRs were inside-the-park
  before 1951 the percentage is higher
program to compare NSB real life stats to stats on baseball-reference.com and/or mlb.com
can certain items in the drop down menu (e.g., the audio) be moved to pop-up menus
  so as to be able to execute them at any time?
add all real life teams (i.e., teams before 1901)
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule
improve Stats->Real Life->By Player selection process (allow user to input a
  partial name and then offer the user a list of players to choose from)
  also, for near-miss matches provide a list of names as "Did you mean?"
  if user inputs one name assume it is a surname and display list of complete
  names for which the user can click on one
allow multiple teams to be used as a source for auto-creating team
allow user to use lifetime stats when determining players to add to team when auto-creating a team (same team, multiple years)
allow user to edit/create stats/players
think about leaving the stats for traded players broken up on the teams
  they played on rather than all the player's stats on one team
    give user option of playing with player real-life stats split on multiple teams
      (because of real-life trades which occurred) or player stats combined onto one team
    splitting up stats may be weird if going to a "bring up player when there's an injury" system
    there will be times where position players pitched; those pitching (and fielding) stats should remain in the 25-man roster
improve/redo schedule algorithm
  MLB constraints:
        Each club plays 162 games and 52 series, including 13 at home on weekends.
        Games within each month and during summer dates should be reasonably balanced between teams.
        Single-series and four-series home stands and road trips should be minimized; two- and three-series home stands and road trips are preferred.
        No more than four-series home stands or road trips should be scheduled
        No doubleheaders in original schedule.
        No team should travel in excess of 50,000 miles over the course of the season.
        Three-game series are optimal (minimize number of two- or four-game series).
        No team can play more than 20 consecutive days without an off day (this is a hard-and-fast rule, because it's in the Collective Bargaining Agreement).
        The schedule must fit within a window of between 178 and 183 days, with the exception of any season-opening series outside of the US (this is also in the CBA).

        In cold-weather cities, MLB tries to schedule the home opener with
        a day off following, in case the first game has to be postponed
        due to weather. Teams also make special requests; the Red Sox are
        always home on Patriots' Day (and have special permission in the
        CBA to play an 11 AM game), the Dodgers are always home on Jackie
        Robinson Day (April 15), the Blue Jays want to be home on Canada
        Day, the Nationals (and most other teams, but it's particularly
        important in DC) want to be home on July 4, and so on. MLB does
        its best to accommodate as many of those requests as possible.

        In addition to the rules previously mentioned here, there must be an equal amount of inner-divisional games played as well, for standings balance.

change over to GTK3
  https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html
whenever there is a playoff round where the teams are unknown (usually the 2nd round
  when there are 2 WC teams), after the previous round completes, the next round teams
  should be shown in the standings display
auto-creation of league by year - 1981, special case:  split season + special
  post-season
add to league set-up file:  number of games each team plays in season
  also, auto-creating a league by season, the number of games each team plays should be dictated by the number of games they played that season in real life
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule
allow user to generate team lifetime stats based upon Season Results factors:
    team or city
    years
    AL, NL or both leagues (some teams have switched leagues through the years)
    regular season, total post-season, World Series only, or all
  output:
    number of years in MLB

      regular season
      post-season
    total wins and/or losses over all years

when a sock_gets in gtknsbc returns < 0 it indicates we've lost the
  connection with the server process ... tell the user we've lost the
  connection and then call DisconnectFromServer() to close the socket
  (what about sock_puts?)
when there is a three-way tie for a division there is a 2-game playoff;
  with wild card teams involved the post-season set-up may not be right
auto-create team

   combination
  .if formula consists of "LA" Stat Acronyms and there are no non-LA Stat
   Acronyms then return league averages only
  .allow user to specify minimums based upon stats other than PAs or IPs -
   allow user to input a formula where the results of that formula act as a
   minimum
  .by single season or lifetime
  .allow results to be returned "by player" (as is already being done),
   "by team", or "by year" (season)
  .allow user to factor in if the player's team won the division, made the
   post-season, player's team's won/loss record, games behind division leader
  .allow user to factor in player's position (user can assign a value to the
   different positions)
  .allow user to skip player records where a divide-by-0 error occurs
add the ability to replay exactly a real game & produce boxscore
  also, save NSB game play-by-play (and boxscore?) data in the same
    format as Retrosheet data and allow for replay of game and/or to
    show any boxscore (can create boxscore from play-by-play data)
    (might be able to use this data to figure multi-game records)
allow a real-life season to be replayed optionally including the trades
  when they happened and injuries when they happened
improve display of "batter pic" during gameplay (not all pics are displayed
  because of the way GTK works)
give user ability to play a single-elimination, double-elimination or
  round-robin tournament with any number of teams (randomly selected or
  user-selected teams) (would not be able to use the same team twice)
  also, allow the user to mix different styles in one tournament e.g,
    a round-robin segment followed by a double-elimination segment

  able to scroll through play-by-play while play is stopped)
add STOP SPEECH and START SPEECH buttons to gameplay dialog
enhance computer play with true AI (use fann?)
allow stats to be sorted dynamically by any particular field for "By Team" and
  "Team Totals" (user clicks on a column heading to re-sort and re-display)
calculating "Evaluate Team Seasons":
  "number of games finishing ahead of the second-place team in the
    division/league" - adjust for number of games played and number of teams in
    the division/league
  allow user to include or exclude certain teamnames
add menu items for saving (loading will be done from season set-up dialog)
  a league set-up ... change the way the client and server communicate
  when setting up a league (now the server sends team names rather than team
  IDs, and the client sends back info on every team based upon the order in
  which it received the info from the server ... the client should only return
  the team IDs and years for the teams in the league)
insert/add a dialog when setting up a league asking the user:
  use saved set-up
  number of games the teams play:
    number of games against teams in other divisions in same league (if there
      are multiple divisions)
    number of games against teams in other league (if there is 2 leagues)
  auto set-up:
    by "Evaluate Team Seasons"
    form a league of real life teams (user selects a span of years):
      World Series winners (all, just NL teams, just AL teams)
      division winners (all, just NL teams, just AL teams)
      post season teams (all, just NL teams, just AL teams)
  league options:
    give user option of setting starting lineup by G or by best stats
      also, allow user to select the starting lineup of his choosing for a
      number of games (or through the regular season, or through regular
      season plus post season) after which alert user to revisit ... in this
      case allow user to be alerted if there is an injury to a starter

      line-up choices
         allow computer to create lineup
         use whatever lineup was most used during real life regular season
         alter lineup depending upon how player is doing during NSB season
         how to rest players
      batting order

      certain position in the starting lineup in an autoplayed season
    allow user to see odds to win after a league is setup and before any games
      are played (calculate the odds based upon how the teams fared in real
      life ... what about a league made up of teams from different years?)
    when computer selects starting lineup rather than selecting each player
      based upon most games played at each position, pro-rate a player's
      chance of playing based upon games played at that position taking into
      account all the players who played that position
    alert user of certain events (check real life MLB records to get an idea as
      to what to look for concerning certain items):
        no-hitter
        perfect game
        batter hits for cycle
        game longer than 20 innings (allow user to set # of innings)
        forfeit
        5 hits or more in a game by one hitter
        4 homers or more in a game by one hitter
        20 or more runs in one game (allow user to set # of runs)
        10 or runs in one inning (allow user to set # of runs)
        more than 1 hit in the same inning by the same player
        walk-off hit
        no-assist game
        20+ Ks
        when any game record has been broken, and as a season record gets
          broken
    provide option for user to play multiple seasons for his league
    allow user to repeat last league
    give user option of various styles of selecting a batting order
      allow user to input a formula to be used to select batting order (show formula currently used by computer)
    give user option of basing post-season play upon players' NSB regular
      season stats
    allow user to select the number of games in a season but in doing so the
      stats for that season do not count towards lifetime stats or season
      records
    allow a user to "lock-on" to a team in a league with many teams so that any
      time that team is scheduled to play the user can elect to manage them
if the pitcher is injured while pitching for the third out of the half inning
  (or the final out of the game) it may not be handled correctly
add option of playing a series game with Play->1 Game Against Computer,
  Play->1 Game Against Human & Play->Watch 1 Game Computer vs Computer
add code to check for up-to-date version numbers (server & client version
  numbers matching ?)
correct error-checking for freads & fwrites by using ferror (see HELP file
  loader)
for user-created teams allow an incomplete team to be saved, but don't allow
  that team to be used in games
allow career stats for players to be used in game-play
allow career stats for players to be used when auto-creating a team (for a particular team, or for all teams?)
may need to stop the same user from logging into the same NSB server more than
  once simultaneously (it may cause problems)
    to do this add a "logged in" field to the userinfo file (or expand the
      "status" field)
    also, show which users are logged in and which are not in
      Administration->Users on Connected Server
put a time limit on response to "Accept Challenge?" dialog and tell
  challenger that challengee has a certain time to reply, and then tell
  challenger when time expires (if it does)
put nofork socket connection ports (2) in network byte order
get rid of nsbpoolnet.c
run NSB under Valgrind
when there are multiple changes to one batting order position (e.g.,
  PH then PR) after the forced change dialog after the half-inning is
  completed the play-by-play text is wrong (e.g., it says "Player Y is
  now hitting for Player X." when it should say "Player Y is now playing
  center field.")
if a pitcher is batting and a reliever is coming in the next inning no
  matter what then pinch hit for the pitcher no matter the score
when the batter gets injured and gets on base NSB always replaces him
  at the beginning the next inning - sometimes there should be a need
  for a pinch runner
lineup display during game play ... allow user to see stats on either
  team
outfielders should have occasional assists from more than just failed
  sacrifice flies ... runners attempting to stretch singles into doubles
  and doubles into triples
if hit & run is on and the batter lines out to an infielder with less
  than 2 outs then the runner should be doubled up
  also, if batter strikes out then baserunner(s) will attempt a steal
comparison of real life stats and stats produced from NSB - too many
  total ABs in NSB (is that because players don't miss games?)
  too many total IPs in NSB (this may account for the previous
    mis-comparison)
  too many runs scored in NSB (caused by too many IPs and ABs above?)
  stats need to be spread out (standard deviation) a little (good players
    need to be better and bad players need to be worse)
  need further comparison for various years
add button to gameplay dialog to allow user to take over managing from
  computer
add a PAUSE button to the gameplay dialog which will be sensitive only
  when the user is watching a game (no user managers)
make error alerts look nicer
change strcpy's & strcat's to buffer to sprintf's
change GTK itemfactory menu to manual menu
use memcpy instead of strcpy and strncpy ?
add options to client to specify port number, and to display version
add option to server to specify port number
make the server run as nobody ... allow user to set up the data files
  anywhere accessible to nobody
if a runner gets on base via error and then is erased (via a CS or pick
  off or DP) then any runs scored afterwards should be earned
not all errors would have been an out otherwise (e.g., pickoff attempts,
  outfielder misplays a single so that baserunners advance a base on
  the flub)
refine error calculation ... allow more than just "whereto" to get an
  error, check for errors for hits too, allow for 1, 2, or 3 base errors,
  allow for multiple errors in the same play
when setting line-ups position should be a combo_box in certain cases
implement better regular season scheduling
in the play-by-play the beginning of the inning string (xth inning)
  doesn't always show (only happens at 9th inning?)
in network game show (and interact with) both lineup dialogs
  simultaneously
  also, an alert message should be displayed for one human as the other
    human is selecting his lineup, and while challengee is selecting the
    teams
computer AI should check players already in game for possible replacements
  (by shuffling positions around) as well as the bench players (there
  are times when a pinch hitter remains in the game playing out of
  position because there is no one on the bench to play the position
  being replaced)
allow a user not to have his name and identifying info included in a
  ADMIN->USERS command display
add option to server to disallow certain users, or to allow only
  certain users
more records ... total bases, extra base hits
add context help
if user quits client while sound is playing the terminal needs resetting
  (if executed from the command line) - may have to fork and kill the
  mplayer or sox process before quitting
category leaders - if a player does not have the minimum requirement to
  qualify for the lead in BA, SLGPCT or OBA but if a number of hitless
  ABs is added to qualify and the player still leads in the category
  then he qualifies
add for user preferences:
  don't stop at end of regular season (if there are games left to play
    according to the number user selected to play)
  auto-save league set-up when playing league
combine the 3 or 4 dialogs which come up when playing a game into 1
  dialog, also allow player to set the lineup even when just watching
  a game & add another selection for "quick play" where the user is not
  allowed to set lineup
offer safety squeeze and suicide squeeze for offense
allow user to create new stats for individuals and for teams (e.g., BB Pct
  (BB per 100 AB), BB per G, Game-Winning RBIs, an avg based upon league
  performance, W PCT (pct of a team's W that an individual pitcher won),
  RBI Opportunities, situational stats (how does a batter perform with
  the bases loaded, after the 7th inn when team is tied or trailing,
  with no one on base, BA RISP (both batters and pitchers), BA RISP with
  2 outs, etc), stats per 162 games, etc)
offer an abbreviated scoresheet-style of play-by-play for viewing and
  printing
add stat "Holds" for pitcher - defined as non-starter who enters the game
  in a save situation, records at least 1 out, and leaves the game never
  having relinquished the lead ... cannot be credited to the winning
  pitcher, a pitcher earning a save, or a pitcher finishing a game
Category Leaders, fielding - add categories for LF, CF & RF (retain OF)
stat - "Quality Start" - starting pitcher, 6 (or more) IP, 3 (or less) ER
stat - walk-off hits
stat - games injured
stat - Hit into DP (HIDP) which is GIDP + all other DPs
add OPS (OBA + SLGAVG) to batting stats
add WHIP (walks + hits per inning) to pitching stats
display trivia quiz questions
incorporate split data for pitchers and hitters & emplement logic:
  lefty/righty
  RISP
  what else?
provide lots of sounds and allow user to associate certain sounds with
  certain events
implement algorithm that platoons the players during the automated play
  of a season (based upon ABs & Gs played in a position or positions)
improve scheduling for post-season play ... when multiple teams from the
  same division go to the post-season they should never play each other
  in the first round of the playoffs (unless there is only one division
  in the league)
when client & server conversing never pass team names or player names,
  always pass team IDs + year, or player IDs
allow any player to pitch (as opposed to allowing just pitchers to pitch)
team rosters should not be limited to 11 pitchers
  also, NSB should allow one of the position players to have pitching stats
    which would keep the # of players on the team at 25 and the number of
    pitchers to be 12
allow NSB to use an alternate port to 49999
include a glossary of baseball terms
when asking user to select a team for "By Team" stats for Lifetime
  teams break up the text view by year (ala Real Life teams)
allow user to select teams to play from the season results display
allow players to play multiple positions in the same game (sometimes
  pitchers are position players and vice-versa)
allow user to create/edit/view/delete reports
allow trading of players (only in user-created teams?)
enable user to select a partial line-up, in this case the computer will
  finish the line-up 
allow computer to recommend to user:
  starting line-up batting order
  a player at any of the positions
  pinch hitter
  pinch runner
allow for pitch-by-pitch game-play and decision-making as well as
  batter-by-batter decision-making
rewrite player replacement routine ... put possible substitute players
  in groups by position:  group #1 players who play same position as the
  player being substituted for, group #2-5 3rd-ss-2b, 1b-c, lf-cf-rf,
  p ... if there are no more players to substitute for an injured player
  then team forfiets (?)
allow baserunners to "lean" one way or the other or not at all
offer bullpen management
  factor in pitchers warming up before coming into a game
allow catcher interferences, baserunners interfering with fielders, fielders
  interfering with baserunners
allow baserunners to get hit by a batted ball
allow user to save a game in progress, and to load a saved game
the field "statsind" should be part of the id section rather than the
  stats section
in "Lineup - <team year & name>" dialog (SeeLineup) when user expands
  the dialog to full screen while on defense the lineup remains centered,
  but while on offense the lineup is not centered
when selecting the lineup, if the user selects the NSB AI to do the
  lineup then that lineup should be displayed before continuing
stats to add:
  fielding (for catchers & pitchers) - SB & CS against (for pitchers,
    these two stats are currently in pitching - move them)
  ejections
  team DPs
  triple plays
  successful pickoffs for pitchers (and catchers?)

    1999-2011))
allow category leaders:
  by league
  by division
  by team
improve upon input of series length when establishing a series - possibly
  have two radio buttons:  random and a spin button for number of games
offer a scoresheet as well as a boxscore and play-by-play
provide the ability to un-highlight a player on the Team Roster (when
  creating a team)
keep records that traverse multiple games in the player db such as:
  hitting streak, scoreless streak, winning streak (for pitchers), etc.
records should include team records, game records (longest by inning,
  longest by time, etc)
keep team winning streaks and losing streaks
records:
  add post-season records for 4-game series, 5-game series, 6-game series &
  7-game series
increase maximum allowable size of NSB leagues
one time - immediately after initial installation, played 2013 season (latest
  season at the time) in one running, the "season completed" dialog did not
  go away after clicking OK
  in same session there was a tie for 1st place in the AL east ...
    the tie did not show in the standings although the playoff game was
    played (the bug must be here which didn't allow the "season completed"
    dialog to go away)
make WWW interface to stats
make WWW interface to game
allow pickoff attempts by catchers
allow third strike wild pitches and third strike passed balls
  (note - catcher does NOT get a put-out for the K if batter reaches base)

known bugs, don't know how to fix -
  when expanding a top-bar menu item which uses a separator in the sub-menu
  the following console error message is issued (when running gtknsbclient
  from the command line):
    ** (gtknsbclient:22373): WARNING **: Invalid borders specified for theme pixmap:
          /usr/share/themes/Breeze/gtk-2.0/../assets/line-h.png,
  borders don't fit within the image

  maybe going to GTK3 will resolve this


from Keith Jefferson <keithjefferson@users.sourceforge.net>
.it would be nice if the textual descriptions of each play could be even
 more detailed (perhaps several lines long, with variable delays between
 each line) ... this would allow the game to optionally be slowed down
 to a point where suspense becomes a factor ... reading like a good
 radio broadcast
.add customizable statistical display to pitcher pics and batter pics with
 choices of today's stats, current series, current season, real-life, etc
